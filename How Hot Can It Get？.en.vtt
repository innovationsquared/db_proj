00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:03.970
Hey, Vsauce.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.309
Michael here. And my tea is quite hot,
but it's not the hottest thing in the

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:10.110
universe.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.960
So what is?
I mean, we know that there is an absolute zero,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.869
but is there an absolute hot?
A point at which something is so hot

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.900
it can't get any hotter.
Well to find out, let's begin

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.189
with the human body.
Your internal temperature

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.090
is not constant.
37 degrees, 98.6.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.960
Sure. But those are averages.
Your body's internal temperature fluctuates

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.780
by about one degree Fahrenheit -

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.980
half a degree Celsius - throughout the day in a cycle.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.370
Assuming you sleep at night, at 4:30 in the morning

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.410
your body reaches its coolest natural
healthy temperature.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.280
And at 7 p.m. it reaches its highest.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.629
But a dangerous fever is not good.

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.270
108 degrees Fahrenheit is almost always

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.080
lethal.
The highest recorded air temperature across

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.350
all of Earth has happened four times in Death

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.640
Valley, where it has reached 129

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.229
degrees Fahrenheit.
180 degrees Fahrenheit is the recommended

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:18.640
temperature for water

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.020
when brewing coffee.
And at 210 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.920
a cake is done.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.740
2,000 degrees Fahrenheit is the
temperature of lava

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.790
fresh outta the ground.
But come on. Make your own lava

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.020
like Green Science Pro. This guy uses
Fresnel lenses to focus the sun's

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.159
energy onto whatever he wants.
This is a small piece of obsidian,

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.340
volcanic glass, which he can melt into actual lava

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.909
right in his backyard.
Keep in mind that the Sun is having that effect

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.450
even though it is 93 million miles away from

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.899
Earth.
Right up on the surface of the Sun is a different story.

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.380
The surface clocks in at 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.000
but the centre, where fusion occurs, is ridiculous.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.140
Temperatures there reach 28

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.760
million degrees Fahrenheit, which is also known

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.069
as 15 million Kelvin.
The Kelvin scale

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.370
has units that are the same size as a Celsius degree,

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.709
but it's an absolute scale, where 0 is

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.390
absolute zero. When matter reaches
temperatures as high as those found in

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.610
the centre of the Sun,

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.989
an enormous amount of energy is radiated

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.319
away.
If you were to heat only the head

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.620
of a pin to the temperature of the centre of the Sun,

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.879
it would kill any person within 1,000 miles of it.

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.709
Speaking of which, the energy emitted by an object

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.220
often tells us a lot about the temperature

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.060
of that object.
Any object over absolute zero

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.319
emits some form of electromagnetic radiation.

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.760
You and me, we don't glow visibly, but we do emit

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.250
infrared light.
We can't see it, but infrared cameras

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.640
can.
WBT has great videos

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.640
and here he is, hiding inside an opaque black

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.450
trash bag.
Now, we can't see him, but his body is

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.659
infra-redly glowing through it.
If you want something to be the right

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:21.269
temperature to glow in the

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.739
visible spectrum, you'll have to reach the Draper point,

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.849
about 798 Kalvin.
At this point almost any object

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.879
will begin to glow a dead red.

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.180
We can calculate the expected wavelength of radiation

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.900
coming off of an object because of its
temperature and that wavelength

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.409
gets smaller and smaller the hotter and
hotter the object gets.

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:50.120
It goes from radio waves to microwaves
up through infrared divisible,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.069
all the way to x-rays and gamma-rays,
which are created in the middle

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.319
of our Sun.
At temperatures as hot as the Sun,

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.379
matter exists in a fourth state.
Not solid, not liquid, not gas,

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.840
but instead, a state where the electrons
wander away from the nuclei

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.549
plasma. If you've watched my temperature
lean back you know that you could make

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.269
plasma by microwaving fire

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.500
But don't do it. Besides, our Sun isn't
even close to being the hottest thing in

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.490
the universe.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.410
I mean, sure, 15 million Kelvin is pretty incredible,

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.760
but the peak temperature reached during
a thermonuclear explosion

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.050
is 350 million

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.470
Kelvin, which hardly counts,
because the temperature is achieved

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.389
so briefly.
But inside the core of a star,

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.560
8 times larger than our Sun,

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.139
on the last day of its life,
as it collapses in on itself,

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.340
you would reach a temperature of 3

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.290
billion Kelvin.
Or if you wanna be cool,

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.810
3 GigaKelvin.
But let's get hotter.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.510
At 1 TeraKelvin, things get weird.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.080
Remember that plasma we were talking
about that the Sun is made of?

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.910
Well, at 1 TeraKelvin, the electrons
aren't the only thing that wander away.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.010
The hedrons themselves, the protons and
neutrons in the nucleus

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.389
melt into quirks and gluons,

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.500
a sort of soup.
But how hot

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.400
is a TeraKelvin?
Frighteningly hot.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.150
There's a star named WR

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.050
104, about 8,000 light years away from us.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.169
Its mass is the equivalent of 25

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.320
of our Suns, and when it dies,

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.060
when it collapses, its internal
temperature will be so great

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.910
that the energy emitted,
the gamma radiation it flings out into space

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.360
will be stronger than the entire amount
of energy our Sun

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.080
will ever create in its entire lifetime.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.160
Gamma ray bursts are quite narrow,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.479
so Earth is most likely safe,
but what if it wasn't?

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.789
Well, when WR 104 collapses,

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:15.139
even though Earth is 4,702 trillion miles away,

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.610
the energy it releases

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.639
would still be bad news.
Exposure for 10 seconds

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:24.949
would mean losing a quarter of Earth's ozone layer,

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.909
resulting in mass extinction, food chain depletion

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:30.509
and starvation

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.560
from 8,000 light years away.
Closer to home,

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:39.639
right here on earth in Switzerland,
scientists have been able to smash

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:40.560
protons

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.759
into nuclei, resulting in temperatures much

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:47.229
larger than 1 TeraKelvin.
They've been able to reach the

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:50.319
2 to 13 ExaKelvin range.

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:53.509
But we are okay, because those temperatures last

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:57.699
for an incredibly brief moment and only
involve a small number

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:03.460
of particles. Remember how we could
calculate the wavelength of the

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.430
radiation emitted by an object based on its temperature?

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.069
Well, if an object were to reach a temperature

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:14.039
of 1.41 times 10 to the 32

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:20.389
Kelvin, the radiation it would admit would
have a wavelength of 1.616

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:24.490
times 10 to the -26th nano meters,

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.180
which is tiny.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.700
Like so tiny, it actually has a special name.

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:37.569
It is the Planck distance,
which according to quantum mechanics

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:41.550
is the shortest distance possible in our universe.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.460
Okay, well what if we added

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:50.180
even more energy?
Wouldn't the wavelength get smaller? It's supposed to,

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.750
but yet it can't.
This is where we've got a problem.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.479
Above 1.41 times 10 to 32 Kelvin,

00:07:57.479 --> 00:08:01.690
the Planck temperature,
our theories don't work.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.340
The object would become hotter than

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.759
temperature.
It would be so hot

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:11.759
that what it is would not be considered a

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:16.880
temperature. Theoretically, there is no
limit to the amount of energy we could

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.279
keep

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:21.430
adding into the system.
We just don't know what would happen

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:25.250
if it got hotter than the Planck temperature.
Classically,

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:29.639
you could argue that that much energy in
one place would instantly cause a black

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:30.570
hole to form.

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:34.589
And a black hole formed from energy
has a special name -

00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:38.419
a Kugelblitz.
So basically, what I'm trying to say

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:42.909
is when you want to tell someone you
like that you think they are

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:46.740
hot, so hot that not even science can
understand it,

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:51.300
just call them a Kugelblitz.
Finally,

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.370
here is something fun.
The Sun

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:58.870
is about 4.7 billion years old,
about halfway through its life cycle

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.589
and so far it has burned 100

00:09:02.589 --> 00:09:04.010
Earths worth

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.620
of fuel, which sounds like a lot, but the Sun

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.260
is the size of 300,000 Earths.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:15.860
Because of that discrepancy, you can
have a lot of mathematical fun comparing

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:20.850
your energy output to the Sun's.
The Sun is way hotter than us

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:25.400
and it puts out way more energy than us.
Bad Astronomy had a lot of fun with this one

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.380
and although it doesn't really mean
anything, it is technically true,

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.480
because of the Sun's enormous size, that one

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.570
cubic centimeter of human puts out more

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:39.480
energy than an average cubic centimetre of

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.460
the Sun.
Which should make you feel

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.600
quite warm inside.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.840
И, как всегда, спасибо за смотрящий.
