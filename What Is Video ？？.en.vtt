00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.060
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here,
and I just got back from

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.460
VidCon. The entire convention was
incredible, but the whole time I was

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.100
there

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.620
I thought a lot about video.
We all watch video

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.240
and many of us work with video,
but what is it? I mean, what really

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.920
is video? Well, guess what, today
we're gonna take a look.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.949
To begin I think we should start all
the way down at the bottom

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.300
with language.
What does the word record mean?

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.760
The story behind the word 'record' is
actually quite cool and makes me a little

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.760
sentimental.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.690
The word 'record' comes from the Latin,
where "re" means

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.440
again and "cor" means the heart or the soul.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.200
So when you record something you are
literally bringing it back

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.039
into your heart, bringing it back into your
soul, remembering it.

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.289
Now, that sounds really nice and pretty,
but it actually had more to do with the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:49.700
fact that

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.440
ancient people thought that the heart
was we were stored memories, not the brain.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.460
The reason a sequence of still images
can appear to be moving

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.489
is an effect known as "beta movement."
If images move fast enough

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.939
our brain can't comprehend them as
separate images and the illusion of

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:05.610
motion

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.170
is created.
Now, for a very long time we recorded

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.960
moving images on photographic film,
but later on

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.790
a new way of capturing moving images
came about and it was called

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.189
"video."
Video comes from the Latin for "I see"

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.259
and rather than preserving a moving
image chemically on celluloid

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.549
photographic film stock,
video is an electronic

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.220
representation of the moving image.
Now in the real world stuff just

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.159
happens. The things just continuously
happen. But in the world of a camera,

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.119
whether it's film

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.790
or video camera, it's almost always in
the form of frame rates.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.570
Pictures of the world taken at a
certain speed that are then quickly gone

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.079
through

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.659
producing, through beta movement,
the illusion of movement.

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.750
When a camera records at a lower frame
rate, playback often looks

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.649
jittery and skips like this. More frames
per second means that more information

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.110
is taken every second

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.610
leading to more fluidity.
But that leads to a whole can of worms,

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.619
which is a great transition to a
conversation I had with Dylan from

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.119
HouseholdHacker at VidCon.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.280
Roll the tape.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.800
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here, and I am in the bathroom at VidCon and I've got a special guest. Right outside

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.260
it's Dylan from HouseholdHacker.
Hey, what's going on everyone?

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.069
You know, I got a good question for you
based on frame rates and what not. What would you

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.550
say

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:31.050
the human eye sees as a frame rate? Very good question. What frame rate do we see the world in with our

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.099
eyeballs?
I mean,

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.410
how fast does information travel
from our eye to our brain?

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.730
It obviously can't be too low,
because fast objects don't look like they're

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:40.540
skipping,

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.980
they look pretty fluid. Well, it's a little bit of a
trick question because our eyes

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.879
are not cameras.
Instead, they track onto objects

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.220
and receive a continuous flow of photons
onto the retina

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.250
sending information via a chemical reaction

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.150
to the brain. Now, here's what we do now.
The visual cortex in our brain

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.409
usually holds that information
from our retina for about a fifteenth

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.400
of a second. So if an animation moves
fifteen frames a second

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.720
or faster, it's gonna look nice and fluid.
But

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.569
if it's lower than fifteen frames a second,
our brain's not fooled by the beta

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:14.159
movement

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:19.700
and it'll look like it's skipping. So, basically,
the faster the frame rate, the better

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.269
everything's gonna look in the end. Here's the thing.
If frame rates get higher and higher,

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.500
you wind up with an image that can
actually cause headaches when people

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.549
watch it on the screen.

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.989
Uhm... Here, I'll explain why.
Hold this camera for a second.

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.450
Oh yeah, no problem.
So back to the point

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.060
about our eyes tracking onto objects.
If I do this -

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.709
move my hand in front of my face and
track it with my eyes -

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.340
I can see my hand, it makes sense. But at
a certain point my hand will move so fast

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.239
that it's just a blur and the reason
it's a blur is because my eye

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.890
can only track so fast. And when objects move
faster than our eyeballs can track, your brain

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:57.530
adds in

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.900
motion blur. That way we get a sense of
movement happening,

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.140
but we don't see something like a hand randomly

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.819
appearing all over the place.
But this becomes a problem with new

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.659
high-definition programs on

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.640
big televisions, because some of those
programs are brought to your TV

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.949
at frame rates as high as a 1000 frames a second.

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.739
And objects, like a tennis ball,
that normally travels so fast

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.440
our eyes can't track them and they look blurry
don't look blurry,

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.240
because the camera is able to see them
clearly. And when you watch that program

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.970
on TV

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.470
you can actually get a headache or get
dizzy, so they're having to find ways to

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.650
add blur

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.160
back into HD pictures.
Pretty neat, right?

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.380
That's great information. How did you
learn this? That's what I'm here for, man.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.919
Thank you. See you.
See you.

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.119
You know, the bathroom. You know.
I heard you coming out. Did you wash your hands?

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.160
Uhm, yeah.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.830
So there you go. Some cool facts about
video that I learned while I was flying

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.590
to

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.720
and from VidCon from New York to LA.
It was a long flight, but I learned a lot

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.509
and I wanna end with some numbers about
YouTube specifically.

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:11.259
YouTube host videos from all over the world.
Massive,

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:14.840
massive amounts.
In fact, every minute of the day

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.750
people are uploading video to YouTube.
And if you were to take all the video

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.550
uploaded to YouTube at any given minute,
all together it would equal

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.250
48 hours. That's right.
Two full days of video

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.699
are uploaded to YouTube every single
minute. You guys are part of something

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:35.199
gigantic. All right, now later this week
I'll have a new episode of IMG.

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:38.570
And soon enough we'll have episodes of
DONG, LÃœt, it's gonna be super cool, so be

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.580
sure you're subscribed so you don't miss anything.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.620
And as always,

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.000
thanks for watching.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.460
They're not, they're not the same person.
