00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.220
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
Ten

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.730
centimeters - about four inches.
This

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.809
is how much taller on average people

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.040
are today than they were 150

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.340
years ago.
Better nutrition and medical care

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.670
early in life has allowed us to better
take advantage of the blueprints

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.830
within our genes.
Blueprints that carry plans for just how

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.140
big a healthy human being can get given

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.670
an optimal environment.
In terms of height, those plans

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.170
rarely exceed 7 feet 6 inches.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.239
But individuals with endocrine disorders,
for instance a tumour,

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.030
near the pituitary gland in the brain
can experience growth that occurs more

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.450
rapidly and for a longer period of time

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.500
than usual.
For instance, Igor Vovkovinskiy,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.059
who at 7 foot 8 inches is the
tallest man currently living

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.079
in America.
The tallest living person anywhere on Earth

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.949
is Sultan KÃ¶sen, who at 8 foot 3 inches tall

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.460
also holds the Guinness world record for largest hands

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.530
and feet.
But the tallest person

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.850
ever officially recorded was Robert Wadlow.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.240
He was the size of an average adult male
when he entered

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.159
kindergarten at the age of 5.
When he died

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.220
in 1940 at the age of 22, he was

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.990
8 foot 11 inches tall.
Andre the Giant

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.990
was 7' 4".
And this

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.310
is me holding a 12-ounce can.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.840
Here's Andre doing the same.
Human size variation

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.590
is fascinating, but what's the maximum, biologically

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.220
how big can a human get?
And more importantly,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.619
how big are you really?

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.060
It turns out that today, now

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.450
in history, average human height

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.630
is probably quite near the genetic

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.360
limit.
By manipulating the very genes responsible for height,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.319
we may be able to add an extra 15
centimeters or so to that

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.120
average, but beyond that we are likely to hit

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.660
a ceiling.
In order to regularly produce

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.250
people over 8 feet tall, 2.44 meters,

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.260
those people would probably need to be

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.300
a different shape.
Not human shaped.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.300
This is because of the square-cube law.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.819
As a shape grows, say, taller,
its volume increases at a greater rate.

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.120
Take a look at this cube.
If we make it 10 times larger,

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.610
well, sure, it's 10 times as tall,
but the area covered by its faces

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.209
is 100 times larger and its volume,

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.400
the space within it, is 1000 times larger.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.900
Now, since weight is connected to volume, this cube

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.090
only has one hundred times the
cross-sectional area to support itself,

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.950
but one thousand times the weight to support.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.200
So, if you were ten times larger,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.360
and still shaped like a person, that is
your proportions were the same as they

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.129
are now,

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.640
you would need to either have a skeleton
made out of something stronger than bone

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.360
or bones that were monstrously thick,
like way out of proportion.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.159
But even if you solved the bone and
muscle strength problem,

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.650
there would still be a whole host of
other issues. For instance, your heart

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.099
wouldn't scale up fast enough to
keep blood pumping throughout a body

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.489
that large.
Animals can get that big,

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.549
because their proportions
and organs are quite different.

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.290
Chris Howard from Earth Unplugged 
tipped me off to the

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.299
giant, not human proportioned, legs

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.610
of the largest land animal ever known to
have existed with

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.680
the certainty of a complete skeleton,

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.950
the awesomely named giraffatitan.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.189
Discovered in Tanzania and now mounted
in Berlin's Humboldt museum

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:08.700
it probably weighed 20 to 30 thousand kilograms.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.269
The Bruhathkayosaurus may have been even larger,

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.470
but this is controversial because we
only have a few of its bones.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.650
Estimates put this guy at 140,000

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.410
kilograms.
Any larger than that,

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.490
and in order to survive long enough to reproduce,

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.970
an animal would need more buoyancy to
counteract its weight

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.630
than air can provide.
This is one of the reasons

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.960
blue whales love the water so much.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.600
The heaviest blue whale ever measured by NMML

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.699
weighed in at 177,000 kilograms,

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.750
making it the heaviest animal we are aware of

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.190
that has ever existed.
It might be the heaviest

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.080
possible, because animal size is limited
by simple geometry

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.139
and the gravity of our planet.

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:07.060
Theoretically, humans born on Mars could
grow a few inches taller,

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.800
because gravity there is only one third
of what it is on earth.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.250
The trade off of course being that their
bones and muscles wouldn't grow strong

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.039
enough

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.229
for them to ever visit Earth and

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:23.360
enjoy it. The point is, in order to have
the same shape and proportions that we

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.639
have now,

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.810
we can't really get that much bigger.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.009
Some of the higher estimates of the upper
limit up

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:34.880
average human height are around 7 feet tall.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.320
A person who is more than 9 feet
tall would struggle to move around.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.870
aAd up in the 12- to 15-foot range, it would be

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.710
difficult to live very long at all.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.840
But what does size mean?

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.940
Where do you really begin

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.180
and end?
So far we have been measuring people using

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.759
their rigid boundaries.
It's a good one to use,

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.860
it's very common, but of course, when I speak

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.740
I can fill an entire room and when I shout

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.009
I can fill city blocks.
That's

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:15.930
huge.
Of course, my voice is not a part of my physical body.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.470
It's not part of the matter that fits
within my skin container.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.680
But it's relevant to the question of how big

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.810
a person is.
How large of an

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.310
impact on their environment can a person
have using what comes directly

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.190
from their bodies?
Well, Guy Murchie illustrated this quite well

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.810
in his tome "The Seven Mysteries of Life."

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.000
The little solid dogs are small,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.550
but their sound and smell extend into
shapes and sizes no creature could even

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.389
dream

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:50.650
of filling up with their bodies on earth.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.710
Let's begin with sound.
How far

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.130
can your loudest shout travel?
How much bigger are you?

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.240
The volume of space within which people
are aware that you exist

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.550
when you shout.
Well, the loudest shout a human can make is about

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.990
88 decibels from 30 centimeters away.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.280
A shout like that will die out down below
the threshold of human hearing

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.849
in our atmosphere, after traveling about 5

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:22.380
kilometres or 3 miles.
A person standing downwind from you

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.449
might be able to make you out a little
further than that,

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:28.919
but the point is, in space no one

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:34.099
can hear you scream.
And on earth, from 5 kilometres away,

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:38.000
no one can hear you scream.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.039
But could they see you scream?
Really, could they see you

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:45.039
at all?
Well, on the surface of the earth,

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:48.050
the furthest you can see another person is

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.800
the horizon.
If you and another person are standing on the ground,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.930
that distance is about 5 kilometers

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:59.580
or 3 miles. Any further away than that
and you will literally be hiding

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.030
behind the curvature of the earth.
So what about

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:08.569
in, say, outer space, where moving away
from another person doesn't mean

00:08:08.569 --> 00:08:14.099
eventually hiding behind the earth.
Well, as an object moves farther and farther away,

00:08:14.099 --> 00:08:17.259
it becomes smaller and smaller.
Of course, the

00:08:17.259 --> 00:08:21.210
actual size of the object doesn't change.
What does change to you

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:27.069
is its angular size.
This brilliant measurement describes how much

00:08:27.069 --> 00:08:31.020
space in your visual field an object takes up.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.180
Imagine your visual field as a complete

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:38.919
circle, 180 degrees of which go from the
horizon in front of you

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:43.240
to the horizon behind you.
So, an object with an angular size

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.709
of 90 degrees would have to be big enough

00:08:46.709 --> 00:08:51.130
and close enough, so as to take up all
the space from the horizon

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.320
to right above you.
Interestingly, your

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.269
thumb held at an arm's length away from your face

00:08:58.269 --> 00:09:02.620
takes up about one degree of your visual field.
Its size

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.730
is 1 degree.
The Moon takes up about

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.980
half a degree at all times.
It sometimes appears

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.820
larger at the horizon, but that's because
of an illusion that AsapSCIENCE

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:14.610
covered

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:19.820
really well. 
Te smallest angular size we can see with the naked eye

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.980
is about one arc minute, a sixtieth

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.760
of a degree. But given enough contrast,
we can see things like Sunspots,

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.930
a mere 20 arc seconds across,

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:35.620
a third of a sixtieth of a degree.
Plugging in numbers to do the math

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.029
will tell us that with perfect conditions:

00:09:39.029 --> 00:09:43.810
outer space, no air, no obstructions,
a lot of contrast, because you are wearing

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:47.070
bright white, the farthest away

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:50.510
a person could see you with their naked
eye would be about

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.880
10 to 15 kilometres.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.000
Any further away than that and they will
have passed the edge

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.760
of your naked eye visibility existence.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.790
But... do you smell that?
It might be

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:10.029
you.
If we consider the senses of other animals,

00:10:10.029 --> 00:10:14.200
your smell, your scent, might be your

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.390
largest earthly dimension.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.910
You know how animals like cats and dogs
have those cute little

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.959
wet noses?
It's called

00:10:23.959 --> 00:10:28.390
a rhinarium.
Rhinariums allow mammals to smell

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:32.769
really really well.
They don't just pick up molecules that float by,

00:10:32.769 --> 00:10:36.550
they localize them.
Air cools the wet nose,

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.550
allowing the animal to tell the source of the smell.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.290
It's the same as when you wet your
finger and stick it in the air to tell

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.970
the wind's direction.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.410
A Bloodhound can pick up and trace to you

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.740
a scent trail that is days old,

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.380
making your scent imprint on the earth

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.970
about as large as you can move in a couple days.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:02.760
But the Silvertip grizzly has a sense of smell that is

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.420
seven times stronger that a Bloodhound.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.630
These guys can smell things from 18 miles away,

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:14.560
nearly 30 kilometres.
That's probably

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.470
the largest bubble we could draw around you

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:22.209
and still call you, because it contains

00:11:22.209 --> 00:11:26.450
things that you omitted that can be
traced back to you by other living

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.050
things.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:31.420
But if we include everything you emit,

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:35.390
well, fundamentally we're limited to the edges of earth's

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:39.170
atmosphere,
because with the exception of a few light molecules,

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:42.360
hydrogen, helium, which escape into space,

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:47.870
not much else leaves. There's no medium in
space for your sound and smells to

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.500
travel through.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.560
Which brings us back to light.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.110
The human body emits light,
electromagnetic radiation.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:00.200
Most of it is infrared light,

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.399
heat.
But some of it lies within the visible spectrum,

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:08.639
though it's about 1,000 times dimmer than
the dimmest light

00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:12.620
the eye can see.
It seems that what little visible light you

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:17.269
do emit is tied in some way to your circadian rhythms,

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:20.730
meaning that around 4 p.m. everyday,

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:24.430
you are literally visibly the brightest

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:28.800
you will be all day.
But here's the thing about light, about

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.800
electromagnetic radiation.
It doesn't need a medium to travel through. It just

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.070
keeps going

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:39.490
out into and through space,

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:43.130
which of course brings us to Australia.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.990
If you're not subscribed to Derek's channel Veritasium

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.990
I don't know what you're doing with your life.
It is amazing

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:54.019
and he recently made a video that I have
not been able to stop thinking about.

00:12:54.019 --> 00:12:57.570
The smallest possible piece of light

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:00.680
is a photon and the human eye can

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.040
kind of perceive individual photons,
a bit better than chance.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:10.149
But some frogs can see individual
photons quite well.

00:13:10.149 --> 00:13:14.250
Now, in his video he explains that,
as you move away from the Sun,

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:19.100
its angular size gets smaller and
smaller and smaller, until eventually

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:24.120
you're so far away from the Sun that you
can no longer see it.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.519
But it's still there and it is still emitting light

00:13:27.519 --> 00:13:30.680
that can reach your eye, except now

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:35.380
that light has been spread so thin
it's not big packets of light you can

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.310
see,

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.320
it's just individual photons.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.360
The Sun is still there, it's just less frequent.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.410
Sometimes a photon hits your eye,

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:49.970
sometimes nothing and sometimes a photon again.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.720
Well, the same thing happens to radiation emitted

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.899
by you.
I Skyped with Derek this afternoon

00:13:57.899 --> 00:14:05.899
and he calculated that the human body,
seen at a distance of 168,000 kilometres

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.420
would also be reduced to merely

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.880
a few individual photons.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.529
Further than that and your size would

00:14:15.529 --> 00:14:18.639
no longer get smaller, it would just

00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:22.620
remain individual photons flying through space,

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.889
they are, after all, indivisible.
So,

00:14:25.889 --> 00:14:29.779
your physical size is limited by geometry

00:14:29.779 --> 00:14:33.010
and biology and gravity.
Your

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:36.360
vocal and fragrant size can be bigger

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.970
but it still limited by the size of Earth.

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.490
But your light, your personal

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:47.529
glow, isn't really bounded by anything.

00:14:47.529 --> 00:14:52.000
The photons that you are emitting right
now, the ones that don't get absorbed by

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
anything,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.149
have no reason to ever really stop.

00:14:56.149 --> 00:15:00.459
And they can continue conceivably past
even the observable

00:15:00.459 --> 00:15:03.579
universe, making you,

00:15:03.579 --> 00:15:07.040
in a way, completely huge

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.480
and kind of immortal.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.000
And as always,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.540
thanks for watching.
