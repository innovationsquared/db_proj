Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
In 1826 this became the very first photograph

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:13.940
ever taken.
And in 1992, this became the very first image

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.970
ever uploaded to the web.
But how many photographs have we all taken,

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:27.250
altogether throughout all of history?
Well, 1000memories investigated this very

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.960
question.
They took a look at the number of digital cameras

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.890
currently in use, typical usage of a digital
camera, as well as the amount of analog film

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.760
and film-developing supplies used by the industry
ever since the 19th century.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:52.170
Tabulated altogether, they estimated that
we have taken 3.5 trillion photographs, 4

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.030
billion of which were taken this year alone.
We are snapping more photographs than ever

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.879
before, because of the proliferation of easy-to-use,
affordable digital cameras.

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:10.530
In fact, we take 4 times more pictures per day
than we did 10 years ago.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.870
Or think of it this way.
Today, every 2 minutes, humanity takes more

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.300
pictures than we took altogether in the entire 1800s.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.170
Of course, the 1800s were a long time ago.
But if we take every year from the invention

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:36.060
of photography until today, 10% of all of
those images, a tenth of every still image

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.850
recorded of our world, was taken in the last 12 months.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.990
That's a lot.
But even crazier is the fact that a fifth

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.470
of these images, 20% of them, all wind up
in the same place - Facebook.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.060
Facebook is huge.
But to put it in perspective, you Vsaucers

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.450
are huge.
If all of us got together in one place and

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.229
claimed independence, we would become the
152nd largest country on Earth.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.819
Right between Guinea-Bissau and 
Trinidad and Tobago.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:19.980
But Facebook, with is 1 billion users, would
be the 3rd largest country on Earth.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.650
To take a quick, dark detour, of those 1 billion
people on Facebook, it's estimated that 30

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.590
million of them are now dead.
And in 100 years, it's estimated that half

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.010
a billion of the people on Facebook will be deceased.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.250
Facebook stories offers a really neat tool,
where you click on a country and then see

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.080
what other countries most of their Facebook
friends live in.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.959
It's fun to see what countries are most connected
to which others, but this whole thing brings

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:58.340
up the question of degrees of separation.
If you were to take 2 random people on Earth,

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.440
how many friend of a friend of a friend of
a friends would you need to connect those

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.930
2 people?
Well, in the real world, it's a little difficult

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.690
to figure out, because we don't know who's
friends with who and there are a lot of people.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.990
But, luckily, mathematics has come to our rescue.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.700
Watts and Strogatz showed that you could calculate
the average path between any 2 random people

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.420
quite easily.
In this equation, the "N" stands for the total

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.580
number of people in the population.
And "K" stands for the number of friends each

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.600
person has.
If we assume that each person has, say, 30

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.140
friends and we assume that 10% of our population
is too young to have actual friends, it turns

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.440
out that you can connect any two people on
Earth with only 6.6 connections.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.599
Theoretically.
Of course, in the real world, we don't all

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.700
have the same number of friends, we don't
all have 30 friends and isolated groups make

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.730
the average much, much higher.
Of course, there are non-real world places,

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.110
where these connections are easier to follow.
For instance, Facebook.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.640
Last year, Facebook's data team released two
papers, showing that amongst all Facebook

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:21.160
users at the time, the average distance between
any two random users was only 4.74 friends.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.850
Twitter is even tighter.
It's been shown that any two random users

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.520
of Twitter are connected by only 4.67 friends,
though some studies have shown it to be as

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.410
low as 3.5.
Numbers like that can make impersonal crowd

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.410
seem quite intimate.
But one of my favorite things about crowds

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.430
is how smart they are.
Wisdom of the Crowds is a fascinating phenomenon,

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.430
where the collective knowledge or guesses
or estimations of a big group of people, when

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.330
averaged, are better than one individual person
working alone.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.520
A good example of this is trying to guess
how many jellybeans are in a jar.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.900
Some people will overestimate, while others
will underestimate, but collectively, each

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.930
member cancels out the errors of the other
and the group average estimation winds up

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.500
being smarter than the sum of its parts.
The BBC's demonstration of this is fantastic,

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.430
I've linked it down in the description, it's worth watching.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.680
They had 160 people guess the number 
of jellybeans  in a jar.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:37.250
The guesses ranged from a few hundred to tens
of thousands, but the average of all 160 guesses

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:46.470
was 4,515, only 5 beans away from the exact answer.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.760
It's amazing to think that in a large enough
group, the errors and shortcomings of everyone

00:05:51.760 --> 00:06:00.520
else, no matter how annoying they are individually,
actually can balance and correct our own shortcomings.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.600
It feels good, though a little bit strange
to think that in a group, it's possible for

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:12.120
nobody to be correct, but for everybody to be right.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.000
And as always,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.240
thanks for watching.
