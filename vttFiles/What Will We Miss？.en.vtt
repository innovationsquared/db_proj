00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:03.879
Hey, Vsauce.

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:07.149
Michael here.
And the year 6009

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.690
will be the very first year since 1961 that a year

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.109
when written in Hindu-Arabic numerals 
can be inverted

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.750
and still look the same.
But you and I

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.369
probably won't live long enough to enjoy
the year six thousand

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.590
and nine.
Human lives just aren't long enough.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.119
We will miss out on that.
What other cool future offense will we be

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.380
missing?
Well, first of all,

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.670
you and I will probably be gone before
the completion of the time

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.640
pyramid in Wemding, Germany.
It will eventually be a pile of

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.710
120 concrete blocks.
But the builders

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.730
are only adding one block every 10 years.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.739
Since beginning in 1993 they've added

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.390
only the first three.
At this rate the pyramid will be completed in the year

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.950
3183.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.520
The final block placed by

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.200
our great great great great great great,
more than 30 greats

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.610
grandchildren.
But even they will miss

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.530
an opportunity to frolic and play safely
in the Chernobyl

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.680
Exclusion Zone.
The zone of

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.909
alienation, where radioactive
contamination from the 1986 disaster

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.549
will remain at levels too high

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.439
for safe human activity until not the year 4000,

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.909
not the 5000, not the 6000.
It will finally be safe

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.889
probably in the year 22 000.

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:46.880
Possibly within our lifetimes
but definitely within the next one

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.060
million years,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.320
stars like Betelgeuse and Eta Carinae

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.720
will explode in brilliant supernovas

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.259
visible from earth. I'm bummed I'm
probably going to miss out on these

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.350
events because

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.520
for a few weeks it will look almost as if earth

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.080
has two Suns. Despite being hundreds,
thousands of light-years away,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.239
their supernovas will shine brighter
than the full Moon

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.480
at night and be visible even during daytime.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.670
But the real sky show comes in 3.75

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.640
billion years.
Our galaxy

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.129
is full of stars, viewed from the surface of the earth

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.890
they look like little drops of milk in the sky,

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.640
which is why we call it the Milky Way Galaxy.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.120
But all galaxies are named after

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.420
milk. Milk, lactose,

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.049
lactic, ga-lactic, galaxies.

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.189
And every drop of milk in the sky,
every star that you can see,

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.439
is inside our galaxy, the Milky Way.

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.939
But there's a blurry distant

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.569
shape. This one.
It's not a star, it's not a cloud of gas

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.349
in our galaxy, it is an entirely different

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.859
Galaxy - the Andromeda Galaxy and it's two-and-a-half

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:15.420
million light years away from our own.
It contains twice as many stars as the

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.379
Milky Way

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.230
and it is coming our way.
Headed toward us

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.730
at 300 kilometres a second, faster than a

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.870
bullet.
Right now, the sky looks like this.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.689
In 2 billion years Andromeda
will have approached so closely

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.870
that people will look up at the sky and see

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.409
this.
In 3.75 billion years the night sky will be like

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.659
a scene from a science fiction movie or
an awesome desktop wallpaper.

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.519
Incredible and kind of scary.

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.060
After this scene, the sky will literally
be glowing with the birth of new stars

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.079
as the Milky Way and Andromeda collide,
mixing up into a brilliant cosmic

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.690
tie-dye. This simulation shows how
Andromeda might collide with the Milky

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.150
Way,

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.190
but keep in mind that you are watching billions

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.919
of years pass every second.
These galaxies

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:13.169
are moving fast but they're also huge

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.760
and covering even huger distances.
They

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.829
will collide in the future but within the briefness

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.830
of a single human life they appear almost frozen,

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.180
unmoving.
A couple billion years after colliding

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.960
the course of both galaxies will be
married together

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.199
in a bright glowing centre.
Earth, now

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.509
a stepchild to what was once Andromeda,

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.590
part of a new, bigger family called

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.539
Milkdromeda. It would be so cool to be
alive to see our galaxy

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:52.260
colliding with another.
But don't get all fomo,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.380
consumed by a fear of missing

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.039
out. Because whatever life is around then
will have plenty to envy us for.

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:05.610
They may have spectacular nightly views,
but secretly wish they'd been born in

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.360
our time

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.820
to experience, say, the beginning of the Internet.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.930
They will actually miss out on a lot of things.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.630
Because the Moon moves one centimetre
further away from

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.490
earth every year, 
600 million years from today

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.840
the Moon will no longer be close enough
to earth to completely

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.850
block out the Sun.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.190
Future humans or descendants of humans
will therefore

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.169
miss out on a chance to ever see for themselves

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.260
the beauty of the total solar eclipse
from the surface of Earth.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.440
Long before earth dries up

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.500
Niagara Falls will dry up.
Well,

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.060
not the water part, but the falls part.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.620
Every year the rushing water of Niagara
erodes the rock at the top of the

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.430
falls

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.889
one foot backward.
By the year 52 000

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:03.570
it will have eroded all the way to
Lake Erie and our progeny will have no

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:04.979
Niagara Falls

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:09.200
to enjoy.
Granite has an erosion rate of about

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.440
one inch per ten thousand years.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.190
So, certainly by the year 7 million

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.380
Mount Rushmore, especially its faces, will no longer

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.419
exist.
And because they slowly get

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:28.580
pulled in or rejected into space,
in 50 to 100 million years

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.410
Saturn will no longer have its lovely rings.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.780
So, life on earth in the future

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:41.050
might have awesome supernovas and
galactic collisions to look forward to

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.600
but they probably won't have Niagara Falls,

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.700
Mount Rushmore, total solar eclipses or Saturn's rings.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.310
They also won't have you.
But

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.700
you have you. Except not all of it.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.500
Babies don't begin to form episodic
memories right

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.930
away, meaning that you missed out on. 
You don't remember two of the most seminal

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.490
events in your life.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.690
Your conception and your birth.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.100
But you can experience a bit of those moments

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.880
right now.
First of all,

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:20.380
When Was I Conceived? dot com
lets you enter your birthday

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:23.990
and get back the week your parents probably made

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.190
you happen, as well as the number one
song and the number one movie of that

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.630
week, which may have also been involved.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.420
Light travels quickly, the most quickest

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.539
in fact.
But it can take a photon millions

00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:45.340
of years to escape from the interior of the star
it was created in through nuclear fusion.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.320
It takes time, just like your own gestation

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.789
in your mother's womb.
Newly conceived photons

00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:56.220
struggle through a dense stellar jungle

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.479
of atoms and molecules and electrons that
absorb and reemit the photon, taking a

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:02.900
little bit of energy from it as a randomly

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:07.849
rolls around like a pinball.
Sometimes after thousands or millions of

00:08:07.849 --> 00:08:11.599
years it's random walk finally leads it to the stars'

00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:15.270
surface, where it pops out into space.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:21.870
In a way, is born. A lucky, tiny tiny tiny
percentage of the photons that reach the

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.159
surface of a star

00:08:23.159 --> 00:08:26.800
find themselves on a path that will intersect

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.229
with earth.
And if you are lucky, those photons will

00:08:31.229 --> 00:08:34.300
end their journey by being absorbed

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:39.180
under your own retina.
If you enter the date of your birth or the

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:43.169
approximate date of your conception into
this online calculator

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:47.890
you can find a star that is as many
light years away from

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:53.670
earth as you are old.
When you look up at that start today,

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:57.870
you are seeing light that left the star the very month

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.459
you were born or photons that left that star

00:09:01.459 --> 00:09:05.470
and entered space when
your entire body was just

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.710
one cell.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:13.040
Space is really big and your life is very short

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:18.160
but space is so gosh darn big you don't
have to miss out

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.740
on everything.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.300
And as always,

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.680
thanks for watching.
