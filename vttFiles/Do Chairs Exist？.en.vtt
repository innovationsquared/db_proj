00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.080
Hey Vsauce!

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.209
Michael here.

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.440
And here.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.710
Michael here!

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.580
hey vsauce!

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.710
what is here?

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.820
…. what is there?

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.660
what is there?

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.770
What REALLY exists?

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.719
Do waves exist or are there just things that
are wavy?

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:41.010
When does a piece of food I’ve eaten stop
being food and become me?

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.809
Do chairs exist?

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.820
Ontology is the philosophy of existence.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:58.420
And chairs are what philosophers call ORDINARY
OBJECTS.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.540
Ordinary objects are the plain old common
sense things we deal with every day: spoons,

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.670
buckets, rocks, stuff like that.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.440
Their existence is as obvious as possible

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:19.970
but the more we try to sus out where they
are, the more sus they become.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.220
First of all, sure, this could all be a dream.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.970
Maybe we’ve all been hallucinating chairs
all these years.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.610
Or this could part of the simulated reality
pumped into our brains while our bodies are

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.070
harvested for energy.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.450
But underneath that skepticism there’s a
deeper ONTOLOGICAL question that we need to

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.360
answer first.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.990
Regardless of whether this spoon is made of
real atoms or simulated atoms, is it really

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.200
possible to be “made of” something?

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.040
Take a look at these two things.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.250
As we all know, two minus one is … TWO?!

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.450
There ARE two things here:

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.760
An origami crane AND a piece of paper.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.120
I’m kidding, of course, there’s really
just one: the crane and the piece of paper

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.230
are the same.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:25.940
But watch this.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.370
Where’d the crane go?

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.590
If the paper and the crane were truly identical,
they would share everything in common.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.650
But clearly they don’t: the paper can survive
being unfolded, the crane cannot.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.390
Also, I made the crane, but I didn’t make
the paper.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.730
And the paper was around before the crane.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.710
For two things that are the same, they sure
are different.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.930
This relationship is called CONSTITUTION:
paper constitutes the crane.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.720
It’s a one-to-one relationship, but there’s
another kind of “being made of” going

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.490
on here, too.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.540
This paper is made not of ONE other thing,
but of sextillions of things: fundamental

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:21.080
subatomic particles: electrons and quarks,
or strings, or physical and virtual fields.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.090
This many-to-one relationship is called COMPOSITION.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.960
Philosophers call whatever it is that matter
is ultimately composed of SIMPLES: a simple

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.180
is a thing that, unlike a piece of paper,
has no parts.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.410
No substructure.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.599
Not even a top or bottom.

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.980
It could be the case that there are no simples,
that there’s just a never-ending chain of

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.810
smaller and smaller substructure.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.160
Philosophers call such a reality a GUNKY universe.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.940
If structure never ends in the other direction
and everything turns out to be part of something

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.080
bigger with no final complete composite, that’s
what’s known as a JUNKY universe.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:07.050
Point is: believing ordinary objects exist
and are made up of smaller things is quite

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.050
common.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.270
It’s called ontological reductionism.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.340
It’s the position that wholes are NOTHING
MORE than their parts.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:22.069
But our cranes and our paper challenge that notion.
it seems like being MADE OF some things IS different than

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:24.600
just BEING those things.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.250
Let’’s agree on what it means to exist.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:36.020
Let’s say that for something to exist is
simply for there to be more than zero of it.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:42.350
Pegasus exists if we mean “are there any
winged horses in works of fiction and mythology?”

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:48.400
And pegasus does not exist if we mean, “are
there any physical, flesh-and-blood winged

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.080
horses that evolved on Earth through natural
selection.”

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.760
okay, so if we can agree on that, then of course chairs
exist!

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.580
There’s this one right here.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.350
I can see it and feel it and taste it.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.910
yea. It’s dry and .. a little bit salty.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.530
Dry and salty are what we call PROPERTIES.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.180
Properties tell us what things are LIKE.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.760
For example, this slice of cheese is FLOPPY.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.199
By noticing and sharing properties, we can
let each other know what to expect from things.

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.250
And we all more or less agree on what things
there are.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.630
We give names to stuff and if they catch on,
we put them in dictionaries with the word

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.400
“noun” next to them.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.650
But are all of these nouns an inventory of
the universe … or an inventory of things

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:43.650
we MADE?

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.139
Let me put it this way: do islands exist?

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.670
Well, it’s in the dictionary and a quick
look around confirms that there are more than

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.650
zero islands, so yes.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.699
Islands exist.

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.260
But what about incars?

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.850
An incar is a car that is IN a garage.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:11.810
As a car leaves a garage, an incar diminishes
at the threshold until it collapses into nonexistence.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:18.350
Later, an extremely similar incar may emerge
at the same threshold when the car returns.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.800
Are there any cars in garages right now?

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.840
If so, then incars exist.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.510
You might be thinking, “that’s not a thing.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.000
you just made that up.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.509
And it’s silly: “being in a garage”
is just a property that a car can have.

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:39.620
Stop trying to make incars a thing.”

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.910
Ok, first of all, I didn’t make it up, Eli
Hirsch did.

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:50.410
And second of all, if you think incars aren’t
things, wait till you hear about islands.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:55.380
An incar might just be a relation between
a car and a garage but an island is just a

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.220
relation between land and some water.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:04.130
Now, “island” might be a more useful concept
than “incar,” but does that make islands

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.450
OBJECTIVELY more real than incars?

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.460
And what about trogs?

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:16.370
A trog is an object whose parts are a tree
and whatever dog is nearest.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.020
Here’s a picture of one.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.210
Do you see the trog? this is its tree part
and this is its dog part.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.660
You might be thinking, come on, how can THAT
be a thing?

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.400
The tree and the dog aren’t even connected!

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.600
well so what?

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:35.260
These two pieces of fabric aren’t connected
and yet they’re a thing called a bikini.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:40.820
Now sure, if we cut down this tree and burn
it for warmth, we wouldn’t feel the need

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:46.440
to apologize to what’s left of the trog
for destroying its tree part.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.710
But maybe we should?

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:54.270
What if some extraterrestrials showed up and
said they thought dogs and trees composed

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.700
trogs — would they be wrong?

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.110
Could we convince the otherwise?

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.410
Ontological realists believe that we could.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:08.490
That there really is a mind-independent answer
to the question, “what is there?”

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:14.199
People like Theodore Sider believe that the
universe has “joints” and we can cut up reality

00:08:14.199 --> 00:08:18.130
up into objective, real things by finding
them.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.229
Ontological anti-realists disagree.

00:08:21.229 --> 00:08:25.500
Their position is that what we think there
is is just one way to cut up reality.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:30.820
It’s a good one for us and our needs, but
it’s not objectively more true than any

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:31.820
other.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.820
So who’s right?

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:43.320
Hmm… well if these blocks compose
a tower … what do they compose now?

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.850
Just because we don’t have a name for .. this..
doesn’t necessary mean that I haven’t

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.180
accidentally built something. Does it?

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:56.060
When DO two or more things compose something
else?

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.960
Peter Van Inwagen calls this the special composition
question.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:06.620
In MATERIAL BEINGS he considers possible answers:
maybe things compose something only when they’re

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.620
in contact.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.820
That’s a good thought, but it doesn’t
explain how a BIKINI can be a thing.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:17.290
Or why two books are still just two books
when one is stacked on top of the other.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.610
you know,

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:22.050
Maybe a certain degree of FIXATION is required.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:28.050
Or a ‘melding’ … if a surgeon sewed
us together and the skin healed with no seam

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:33.690
and we shared the same blood supply … you
know, even then it would seem wrong to say

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.830
that we’d become some new kind of animal.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.010
There’d still just me and you.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:41.220
But like, stuck together.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:46.160
The philosophy of parts and wholes is called
mereology and

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.200
Mereological Universalism is the belief that
there’s an answer to the special composition question

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:59.579
and the answer is this: any assortment of stuff, no matter
how strange or scattered across time and space

00:09:59.579 --> 00:10:01.029
composes a thing.

00:10:01.029 --> 00:10:06.420
some pages compose these books but I don't just have two books here. Oh no, there's also a third thing

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.780
let's call it a "took" because it's parts are Two Books.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:17.540
There is also something composed of my left ear,
the northern third of every brown trout in

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.760
England, and the Eiffel tower.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.910
Just because it has no name and no one’s
ever talked about it before just shows a lack

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.050
of intrest on our parts.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:31.650
To a universalist, eliminating some composites
but not others is just too arbitrary.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:35.280
We may as well accept them all.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:41.300
Eliminativism is any belief that accepts some
composites, but eliminates others.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:47.399
Peter Van Inwagen, for example, believes that
there are no ordinary objects, no chairs or

00:10:47.399 --> 00:10:50.220
shirts or shoes.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:55.110
Right here there are just some simples — atoms or whatever
— arragned show-wise.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.550
There isn;t something else here called a shoe.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:02.970
But he thinks that because people believe
they themselves exist, and he can’t see

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.980
how something could believe it existed without
existing in the first place to even think

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.480
that, there must be people.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.120
He goes further, though, to argue that ALL
living thigns exist.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.490
While admiting he doesn’t have any “knock-down”
agruments in their favor, he mentions that

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:23.949
because simples that are part of a living
organism maintain the organism — 

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:28.339
— while shedding some members and gaining
others, all while remaining individuated from

00:11:28.339 --> 00:11:35.120
other organisms, unlike, say, waves of water
at the moment of collision, clearly, simples

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.410
in the act of a life must compose something.

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.170
That position is ORAGANICISM.

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:48.360
It’s been called the belief that people
exist, but that none of them wear clothes.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.480
Mereological Nihilism is less generous.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:58.480
It’s the belief that there aren’t any
trogs or incars OR dogs or trees.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.440
Because nothing ever composes.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.589
The nihilist doesn’t believe that there
is NOTHING here.

00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:07.690
There are lots of simples, but that’s it.

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:12.529
That might sound puzzling: how can a bunch
of fundamental particles, arranged into atoms

00:12:12.529 --> 00:12:17.880
and molecules that are arranged like this
NOT be a chair?

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.170
That’s JUST IS what a chair is!

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.790
Good question.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:27.810
Let’s call that deflationism: the belief
that this is all silly and that all of these

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:33.830
positions are talking past each other: they
all agree on what reality contains: they all

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:39.660
believe that there are simples here and that
those simples are arranged in a chair shape.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.910
Since that’s just what a chair IS, they
all believe in chairs.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:49.230
Those who say they don’t just being weird
and contrarian.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:50.740
Deflationism has many supporters.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.250
And it truly is the heart of our issue today.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:13:01.350
But to address it, we should first see why
it would be nice if all of these parts did not

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:02.430
form a chair.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:09.370
Let’s begin with over-determination: If
chairs really do exist, shouldn’t they be

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:10.580
able to interact with us?

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:16.750
The thing is, though, everything this alleged
chair can do can be described by referencing the behavior of

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.720
simples here and any other simples
that come along.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:25.250
An account of the activities of every ATOM in this room, leaves nothing

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.670
for the chair to explain.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:32.230
Composites are causally redundant.

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:38.260
Believing in chairs is like believing that,
while yes, the burning gas from my stove completely

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:44.220
describes why the water in a pot boils, there’s
ALSO a magical invisible substance called

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:50.230
boil-o that comes out of my stove that does
the same thing as the flame at the same time

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:54.620
and if there was no boil-o the flame would
warm the water just the same, but there is

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.200
boil-o.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.899
Chairs are no more real than boil-o.

00:13:59.899 --> 00:14:04.860
Composites over-determine what happens in the world.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.720
They also lead to over-COUNTING.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:12.100
For more on that, let’s say hello to this
video’s sponsor.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.100
Hi.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.730
I’m Michael Stevens.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:18.540
You may know me from such films as ”Lady
Gaga - Judas PARODY!

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:22.320
Key Of Awesome #42” and The Emoji Movie.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.820
But today, I’m here to talk to you about
the Curiosity Box.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:31.670
This season, subscribers will be receiving
many things, including a shirt celebrating

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:39.399
the Sherman line, a kit to find out what bacteria
is growing on you, a puzzle that celebrates

00:14:39.399 --> 00:14:47.639
the average color of neptune and yes, uranus,
and the first ever at-home demonstration of

00:14:47.639 --> 00:14:50.260
impossible colors.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:56.230
And right now, if you subscribe with code BOGO, we’ll
also send you our entire summer box  completely free.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.320
just pay shipping

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:02.570
How many THINGS will you be receiving for
one ridiculously low price?

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.720
You might think 15: 8 things plus 7 things.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.720
 

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:12.510
But don’t forget that you’re ALSO
getting this entire collection and THIS entire collection.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.889
That’s 17 things!

00:15:15.889 --> 00:15:16.889
ORder now.

00:15:16.889 --> 00:15:21.040
That’s a good deal, but the ontology seemed
wrong.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:26.460
If I count some parts, I shouldn’t also
count the whole they compose.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:30.220
But if you believe in composite objects you
MUST do this, right?

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.670
After all, the composite exists.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:41.070
So if this chair contains, say, 100 sextillion
atoms, then there are actually AT LEAST 100

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:47.410
sextillion and one things here: all of these
atoms and also a chair.

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:52.040
That seems wrong.. but wait, there’s more.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:59.420
If I take a knife and scrape off a tiny part
of this chair … is it still a chair?

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.720
I think most of us would say yes.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.980
It would still be a chair even if I removed
a tiny bit again.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:06.980
And again.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:13.160
A series of tiny innocuous removals is called
a SORITES SEQUENCE.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:19.060
The trouble they cause is that while it seems
we must accept that each individual step doesn’t

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:24.660
annihilate the chair, clearly, ENOUGH minute
removals WILL eventually leave us with no

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.190
chair.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:27.490
Nothing at all, in fact.

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:29.149
But how can that be?

00:16:29.149 --> 00:16:34.600
How subtracting zero over and over again EVER
give a different result?

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:40.709
Clearly, there must be a point at which a
tiny change DOES make a difference.

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:46.040
Different people might give different answers
as to where that line is — but, you know,

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:51.730
we could just stipulate the boundaries: we
could define “chair” in some extreamly

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.230
precise way.

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:58.300
If we did that, if we defined the shape, function,
history, and use that makes something a chair

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:03.491
so precisely that the even the smallest deviation
would make or break its status as a chair

00:17:03.491 --> 00:17:07.779
… how could we know if it’d done it right?

00:17:07.779 --> 00:17:13.720
If we called up God and said, “hey dude,
watch this, see this chair?

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.289
Okay, now we’re going to remove a single
atom from it.

00:17:17.289 --> 00:17:18.529
Ta da!

00:17:18.529 --> 00:17:21.000
It’s no longer a chair is it?”

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.079
Would God would be like, “pwha!

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:26.519
Correct! you guys nailed it.

00:17:26.519 --> 00:17:28.069
That is exactly right.

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:33.979
It was a chair before and now, in my infinite
wisdom, I can confirm that that single atom

00:17:33.979 --> 00:17:38.090
was what made the difference.”

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:43.609
Unless there’s some explanation for why
a boundary should be drawn in a precise way

00:17:43.609 --> 00:17:48.630
instead of some other way, our stipulations
are just arbitrary.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:53.859
Ordinary objects may be unredeemably vague.

00:17:53.859 --> 00:17:58.159
But being vague may actually be a feature of ordinary
objects.

00:17:58.159 --> 00:18:01.609
For example, how many people is a crowd?

00:18:01.609 --> 00:18:07.509
10 people standing together in a huge empty
park might be more of a group, but 10 people

00:18:07.509 --> 00:18:13.109
standing further apart in a tiny waiting room
will feel way more CROWDED.

00:18:13.109 --> 00:18:18.499
The fact that our terms depend on context,
that they’re PLASTIC, make it seem less

00:18:18.499 --> 00:18:23.919
and less like they’re describing THINGS
and more and more like they’re pragmatic.

00:18:23.919 --> 00:18:29.460
That rather than telling what there is, they
tell us to expect.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:34.059
Peter Unger has pointed out that there’s
at least one kind of thing that CAN survive

00:18:34.059 --> 00:18:38.799
a sorities sequence without paradox: stuff.

00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:45.249
If you innocuously remove pieces from something
that is just “some stuff” you will still

00:18:45.249 --> 00:18:52.109
have some stuff after each step until you
reach a clear and unambiguous boundary: when

00:18:52.109 --> 00:18:57.119
the last piece is removed, there will no longer
be any stuff.

00:18:57.119 --> 00:19:02.989
This might show that there ARE composite objects:
stuff.

00:19:02.989 --> 00:19:08.269
As soon as we pretend that some stuff is a
THING, though, vagueness sets in.

00:19:08.269 --> 00:19:13.609
Suddenly we’re talking about a thing that
can lose parts but also can’t lose parts

00:19:13.609 --> 00:19:19.369
and unless contradictions can exist, words
like “chair” don’t really refer to any

00:19:19.369 --> 00:19:21.840
thing in the universe.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.450
Sorites seqeunces lead to other problems,
too.

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:29.389
Like: the PROBLEM OF THE MANY.

00:19:29.389 --> 00:19:36.489
If removing a tiny number of atoms from this chair still
leaves me with a chair, how many chairs are

00:19:36.489 --> 00:19:37.489
here?

00:19:37.489 --> 00:19:39.799
I mean, there’s this one.

00:19:39.799 --> 00:19:48.039
And then there’s this one, which is really similar to the first but doesn't have these atoms on top of

00:19:48.039 --> 00:19:49.039
it.

00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:51.269
I don’t even have to remove atoms for this
to be a problem.

00:19:51.269 --> 00:19:56.850
All I have to do try to define which atoms
here are part of the chair and which aren’t.

00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:00.090
At the atomic level, there isn’t a definite
boundary.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:05.389
Near the edge, it will hard to tell whether
a particular molecule is part of the moisture

00:20:05.389 --> 00:20:09.120
in the chair or part of the ambient humidity.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:14.639
Instead of there being a single chair here,
it seems like REALLY there are billions and

00:20:14.639 --> 00:20:18.349
billions of candidates for the chair.

00:20:18.349 --> 00:20:21.619
Which one is the chair?

00:20:21.619 --> 00:20:26.580
But now, suppose that instead of removing
pieces like in a sorities sequences or choosing

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:32.309
pieces like in the problem of the many, we
instead discard pieces and replace them with

00:20:32.309 --> 00:20:34.470
new, similar pieces.

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:40.259
This is the set up to the famous SHIP OF THESEUS
paradox.

00:20:40.259 --> 00:20:43.940
Suppose I buy a boat and name it THESEUS.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:48.110
Over time, parts of the boat wear out and
I replace them with brand new parts.

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:53.769
After, say 10 years, I might realize that
not a single part of my boat was part of the

00:20:53.769 --> 00:20:55.559
boat on the day I bought it.

00:20:55.559 --> 00:20:57.649
Do I now own a different boat?

00:20:57.649 --> 00:20:59.529
Have I owned TWO boats?

00:20:59.529 --> 00:21:04.049
But now suppose the someone has been following
me all these years and has been picking up

00:21:04.049 --> 00:21:08.599
each old part I throw out and storing them
in a warehouse.

00:21:08.599 --> 00:21:12.733
After I replaced all the original parts they
take them and join them back the way

00:21:12.733 --> 00:21:15.299
they way there were 10 years ago.

00:21:15.299 --> 00:21:17.539
Which boat is THESEUS?

00:21:17.539 --> 00:21:18.539
Both?

00:21:18.539 --> 00:21:26.190
If we conclude that ordinary objects don’t
exist, the problems of sorites, the many,

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:31.350
theseus, over-determination, and over-counting
all evaporate.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:38.279
If there are only simples and they never compose
anything, then which one is the ship of theseus

00:21:38.279 --> 00:21:41.450
is easy to answer: neither!

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.820
Neither are the boat and nothing ever was
the boat.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.309
All that happened was that some simples got
moved around.

00:21:48.309 --> 00:21:53.830
The simples the scavenger has are the simples
I possessed when I bought the boat, but there’s

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:59.879
no mystery of persistence: removing or exchanging
a piece of stuff never left me with the same

00:21:59.879 --> 00:22:00.950
stuff.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:08.220
There’s no mystery as to which of the billions
of chair candidates here is THE chair and

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:12.720
the removal of no specific atoms will ever
stop it from being a chair because it there

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.849
is no chair here and there never was.

00:22:15.849 --> 00:22:20.259
There are only simples arranged chair-wise.

00:22:20.259 --> 00:22:26.179
The illusion that there ARE composites
that can survive changes in parts is an artifact

00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:27.179
of our minds.

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:33.010
It’s a helpful one that allows us to track
certain properties and ignore others, but

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:38.640
when taken seriously, it obviously isn’t
really how the universe works.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.640
And that’s okay.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:43.140
We shouldn’t be embarassed when we talk
about boats or chairs.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:49.100
Our words for ordinary objects really do refer
to actual phenomena and therefore are more

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:55.049
correct than believing that, say, the sun
turned into a black hole yesterday.

00:22:55.049 --> 00:23:00.480
Unlike the false statement that chairs exist,
there is NO evidence saying the sun turned

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:04.840
into a black hole yesterday could even be
INCORRECTLY describing.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:10.919
Because of this, Trenton Merricks calls the
belief in ordinary objects false but, “nearly

00:23:10.919 --> 00:23:14.789
as good as true.”

00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:16.970
This is all silly, though, right?

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:19.139
Of course there are chairs.

00:23:19.139 --> 00:23:24.019
If you believe that there are some simples
arranged chair-wise, then you admit that there’s

00:23:24.019 --> 00:23:25.019
a chair!

00:23:25.019 --> 00:23:27.220
Because that’s just what a chair IS.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:33.059
It’s not some additional THING over-and-above
these simples: it just IS them.

00:23:33.059 --> 00:23:39.840
Each is still an atom or electron or whatever,
but TOGETHER they are a chair.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.080
Not so fast there, chair-lover.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.080
 

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:47.700
What do you MEAN “a chair IS simples arranged
chair-wise?”

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:52.840
the phrase “simples arranged chair-wise”
just picks out these simples.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.179
There’s nothing else for that phrase to
refer to.

00:23:55.179 --> 00:24:00.289
There aren’t all of these simples and then
ALSO some OTHER simples that are the simples

00:24:00.289 --> 00:24:02.340
arranged chair-wise.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:06.960
So do you mean that “chair” is a disguised
plural?

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:11.559
That it refers to lots of things like the
phrase “these books”?

00:24:11.559 --> 00:24:16.289
Because “these books” only commits us
to the existence of this book and this book

00:24:16.289 --> 00:24:20.809
but not an additional single
object that’s called a “these books.”

00:24:20.809 --> 00:24:27.879
Likewise, if “chair” just means this simple
and this simple and this simple, then it points

00:24:27.879 --> 00:24:33.859
to a whole bunch of things and not one of
them is a chair.

00:24:33.859 --> 00:24:39.619
Sure, “chairs” exist if by chair we mean
a word for all these simples.

00:24:39.619 --> 00:24:46.369
But if by chair we mean an actual object in
the universe, there just aren’t any, my

00:24:46.369 --> 00:24:47.369
friend.

00:24:47.369 --> 00:24:53.249
Except… maybe there is no chair over-and-above
the simples, but instead something happens

00:24:53.249 --> 00:24:57.510
when an assortment of simples are arranged
into a chair-shape.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:04.029
Each member continues to be a single atom
or whatever, but COLLECTIVELY they all simultaneously

00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:07.240
BECOME one thing: a chair.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:14.019
Okay, so then either there’s no chair here,
just simples; or somehow a miraculous contradiction

00:25:14.019 --> 00:25:20.590
has appeared: many things and ALSO one thing
that, despite both clearly differing in that

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:24.039
respect, are still identical!

00:25:24.039 --> 00:25:28.860
It looks like chairs can’t be identical
to the parts they’re supposedly composed

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.090
of..

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:34.679
but chairs also can’t be DIFFERENT from
their composite parts because there’s nothing

00:25:34.679 --> 00:25:40.649
else there and, after counting and accounting
for their parts, there’s nothing left for

00:25:40.649 --> 00:25:45.720
the existence of a chair to cause or explain.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:52.669
To rescue chairs from non-existence, we need
to find a way to show that a chair is independent

00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:58.999
of its atoms — and therefore distinct from
them — but not SO distinct that it’s impossibly

00:25:58.999 --> 00:26:00.899
over-and-above them.

00:26:00.899 --> 00:26:05.740
We need to find a way to make chairs ONTOLOGICALLY
INNOCENT.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:08.720
To have our cake and not have it, too.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.580
Amie Thomasson does this in a very clever
way.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:16.860
She points out that if I ask you, “hey,
is there anything in the fridge?” and you

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:21.809
open it, see that’s it empty, and say, “there’s
nothing in here” it would be weird if I

00:26:21.809 --> 00:26:29.840
came over, looked inside, found a single eyelash
in the corner and said, “ummm EXCUSE me?

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:35.600
What is this?! you said there was no THING
in the fridge, but there was an eyelash and,

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.619
gosh dangit, the whole things is actually
FULL!

00:26:38.619 --> 00:26:40.619
Of AIR.”

00:26:40.619 --> 00:26:44.889
That would be weird because when I asked if
there was anything in the fridge, it was implied

00:26:44.889 --> 00:26:48.090
that I meant anything TO EAT.

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:53.469
By arguing that the empty fridge is not REALLY
empty, I was using the word “thing” in

00:26:53.469 --> 00:26:56.200
what Thomasson calls a “neutral sense.”

00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:01.629
I used it to mean any and all entities that
could possibly be described.

00:27:01.629 --> 00:27:07.340
But you took me to be using “thing” in
what she calls a “sortal” sense.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:12.039
A sortal is a term that tells us what a thing
is in way that allows us to count how many

00:27:12.039 --> 00:27:16.330
there are AND know when there is or isn’t
one.

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:18.289
“Water” is not a sortal.

00:27:18.289 --> 00:27:22.350
If I told you there was water in my basement
and you asked, “how many waters?”

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:25.059
I’d have to use a sortal to answer you.

00:27:25.059 --> 00:27:27.880
For example, “gallons of water.”

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:33.840
Thomasson argues that the neutral use of “thing”
is meaningless when used to ask questions.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:40.399
For example, if I used thing in a neutral sense and asked how many orange things are in this video

00:27:40.399 --> 00:27:43.109
you would have no idea how I wanted you to carve it all up

00:27:43.109 --> 00:27:46.830
thus, there would be no would be no single correct answer.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:50.729
You might say, "uh, one orange thing? Your shirt?"

00:27:50.729 --> 00:28:00.499
But then I could say, “what, no there's my left sleeve, my right sleeve, the inside of the shirt, the outside of the shirt. Come on, there's way more than one."

00:28:00.499 --> 00:28:06.389
Unless we use a sortal net, any search for
what things there are will end in confusion.

00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:10.830
Not because there are no things, but because
it hasn’t been made clear what conditions

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:13.549
to apply when searching.

00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:19.299
For Thomasson, this means that what we find
depends on what APPLICATION CONDITIONS we

00:28:19.299 --> 00:28:20.299
use.

00:28:20.299 --> 00:28:25.549
If I ask if there’s anything here that the
condition “smaller than a molecule” applies

00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:30.059
to, you could note each such thing and give
me an inventory.

00:28:30.059 --> 00:28:33.200
“Chair” would not be on the list.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:39.509
But if I asked you if there were any medium-sized
rigid-acording-to human strength things here,

00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:44.980
“chair” would probably go on your list,
and no single atom would.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:51.779
If an application condition is satisfied in
the wrold, then the thing is descrbes exists.

00:28:51.779 --> 00:28:55.849
So CHAIRS do exist.

00:28:55.849 --> 00:29:00.340
If the application conditions for one thing
are also sufficient for something else, then,

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:05.879
if we find the first thing, we have found
the other because it’s existence is entailed

00:29:05.879 --> 00:29:12.149
ANLYTICALLY by the existence of the first
thing — that is, by meaning and logic alone.

00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:16.960
For example, if I say that I live in a house
you can conclude — without looking! — that

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:17.999
I live in a building.

00:29:17.999 --> 00:29:23.320
There’s no paradox here, I don’t live
in a house AND a building — two distinct

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.899
things that defy the laws of physics by being
co-located.

00:29:25.899 --> 00:29:32.460
Instead, the conditions that apply to a house
are also sufficient for building.

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:38.169
So a single chair is not impossibly identical
to some collection of many.

00:29:38.169 --> 00:29:41.269
Nor is it somehow over-and-above its parts.

00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:47.609
Instead, atoms arranged chair-wise merely
logically ENTAIL a chair.

00:29:47.609 --> 00:29:52.849
The entailment connects things differentiated
by distinct application conditions.

00:29:52.849 --> 00:29:58.489
When we ask which one is the ship of theseus,
a puzzle erupts because we’re being too

00:29:58.489 --> 00:29:59.489
neutral.

00:29:59.489 --> 00:30:04.250
We need to say what we mean by “ship of
theseus”: if we mean the original parts,

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:05.600
then this is it.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.450
Do we mean the thing registered to me by the
boat authorities?

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:10.470
well then it’s this one.

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:14.639
“But which is the REAL one” is an incomplete
pseudoquestion.

00:30:14.639 --> 00:30:20.440
When it come to sorites sequences, I think
we need to just stipulate where the boundary

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.440
is.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:26.231
I don’t think there’s an objective answer
provided by the universe or God as to exactly

00:30:26.231 --> 00:30:31.899
what is and isn’t a chair, but that doesn’t
HAVE to mean that there aren’t any chairs,

00:30:31.899 --> 00:30:38.229
it can just mean that every single collection
of simples is it’s own unique object independent

00:30:38.229 --> 00:30:43.950
of our minds and that we get to decide which
we will call chairs.

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:50.700
Vagueness comes from our minds and our language
but there are no vague objects in the universe.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:57.330
We don’t have to believe that our reality
is simulated, but I do think we have to believe

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:02.479
that it’s stipulated: it is a reality that
contains not what intelligent machines have

00:31:02.479 --> 00:31:07.529
decided to give us, but what we have decided
we have.

00:31:07.529 --> 00:31:13.309
There’s no fact of the matter as to whether
calling this a star is the TRUE way to carve

00:31:13.309 --> 00:31:14.369
up this stuff.

00:31:14.369 --> 00:31:20.179
It’s a pretty useful way to do it, and helpful
for at least human purposes, but “STAR”

00:31:20.179 --> 00:31:24.019
is a thing WE imposed on the world.

00:31:24.019 --> 00:31:29.350
As Michael Jubien puts it, “there are no
things, but as a consequence there are as

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:32.940
many things as we like.”

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:37.849
As for the problem of the many, we can simply
just admit that there really are billions

00:31:37.849 --> 00:31:40.100
of slightly different chairs here.

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:45.389
Some include a few boundary atoms that others
don’t, but since they all act and react

00:31:45.389 --> 00:31:51.039
pretty much in unison, in our daily lives
it doesn’t matter which exact material collection

00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:53.959
we mean when we say “this chair.”

00:31:53.959 --> 00:31:59.639
However, let’s go back to our cranes.

00:31:59.639 --> 00:32:04.539
When we talked about holes we said that holes
might be ONTOLOGICALLY parasitic.

00:32:04.539 --> 00:32:09.679
That their existence seems to require the
existence of something ELSE: something that

00:32:09.679 --> 00:32:12.500
can HOST the hole.

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.549
Perhaps this crane is holey, too.

00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:21.119
Not a physical thing in its own right, but
a disturbance IN some paper.

00:32:21.119 --> 00:32:26.529
There is no material crane here, there is
only some paper that is arranged crane-wise.

00:32:26.529 --> 00:32:31.979
But once we start entertaining that notion,
we realize that nearly EVERYTHING we see and feel

00:32:31.966 --> 00:32:36.359
all ordinary obejcts and even ourselves are ontological parasites

00:32:38.347 --> 00:32:42.799
Michael Jubien calls our tendency to think
that what is true of a “chair” is true

00:32:42.799 --> 00:32:49.519
of the material that is chairing OBJECT FIXATION
or PROPERTY REPRESSION.

00:32:49.519 --> 00:32:55.130
Object fixation is useful and “nearly as
good as true” but when paradxoes loom, we

00:32:55.130 --> 00:33:01.009
should remember that while chairs exist, they
aren’t made out of matter and can’t be

00:33:01.009 --> 00:33:04.029
touched or or felt or tasted.

00:33:04.029 --> 00:33:08.710
All I can do is taste some stuff while it
chairs.

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:14.639
If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck,
and quacks like a duck, then it’s not a

00:33:14.639 --> 00:33:18.839
duck, but it is arranged duck-wise.

00:33:18.839 --> 00:33:25.410
I think that the only concrete physical things
in our universe are simples — or, since

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:31.409
our universe could be gunky — the material
world only contains stuff.

00:33:31.409 --> 00:33:37.570
And yes, this stuff is chair-ing, but the
road paved by the idea that that makes this

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:41.570
stuff A chair leads to paradox.

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:45.899
To see how we could have made that mistake,
let’s remember the famous Clintonian dictum

00:33:45.899 --> 00:33:51.100
that often “it depends on what the meaning
of “is” is”

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:57.549
There’s the “is” of predication, which
tells us what some thing is like, as in, this

00:33:57.549 --> 00:34:00.739
cheese IS floppy.

00:34:00.739 --> 00:34:05.979
And then there’s the “is” of identity
which tells us what is the same as what for

00:34:05.979 --> 00:34:09.419
example, 2+2 IS 4.

00:34:09.419 --> 00:34:14.300
To believe that chairs are made of matter
— to be believe that YOU are made of matter

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:18.190
— is to confuse these two ISes.

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:22.429
When a collection of properties are extremely
thorough in telling us what to expect from

00:34:22.429 --> 00:34:28.769
some stuff, we tend to just go ahead and NOUN
them: collapse them into a single word and

00:34:28.769 --> 00:34:34.019
believe it doesn’t just describe some stuff,
but REFERS to it.

00:34:34.019 --> 00:34:38.280
I think we have an intuitive sense of the
thoroughness of properties and this can be

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.599
seen in how we order our adjectives.

00:34:41.599 --> 00:34:44.309
“Big” can mean many things.

00:34:44.309 --> 00:34:49.639
A big diamond and big house are very different
in size.

00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:55.399
“Blue” tells me a bit more about what
to expect, but CHEESEBURGER, oooh that’s

00:34:55.399 --> 00:34:56.399
specific.

00:34:56.399 --> 00:35:00.210
So specific, in fact, that we call it a noun.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:05.680
This increasing thoroughness may be partly
responsible for the fact that “big blue

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:12.810
cheseburger” sounds fine, but blue big cheeseburger”
sounds kind of weird.

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:18.859
When we embrace the idea that cheseburgers
are not physical objects, but instead, exist

00:35:18.859 --> 00:35:25.789
as an abstract set of properties like juicy,
warm, soft, and so on, the specter of ontolgical

00:35:25.789 --> 00:35:28.750
paradox dissipates.

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:32.450
You and I are not physical objects either.

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:37.190
“Michael-ing” is a bunch of different
properties and most of them are very vague.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:43.430
They include things like, “knowing who Kevin
is, being more or less a certain height, having

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:46.529
a roughly continous relationship with the
stuff that Mcihaeled yesterday and that that’s

00:35:46.529 --> 00:35:48.819
Michael-ing today” and so.

00:35:48.819 --> 00:35:54.250
Some of what it means to Michael does concern
composition, like, the fact that I will still

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:58.210
exist even if I shave off the stuff I call
my beard.

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:03.529
If I shaved off my beard, there would still
be some stuff Michael-ing, but it would be

00:36:03.529 --> 00:36:05.930
different stuff than before.

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:15.099
We’re able to lose parts and change and
grow because we aren’t made of matter, we’re

00:36:15.099 --> 00:36:16.099
hosted by matter.

00:36:16.099 --> 00:36:17.099
There’s no thing that is you and no thing
that is ME.

00:36:18.099 --> 00:36:24.049
As Alan Watts would say, the universe doesn’t
contain people, the universe PEOPLES.

00:36:24.049 --> 00:36:33.410
Chairs and tables and rocks and buckets and people are not made of atoms, they are preformed by atoms.

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:39.642
We are disturbances in stuff and none of it
is us.

00:36:40.643 --> 00:36:44.605
This stuff right here is not me. It's just me-ing.

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:50.910
We are not the universe seeing itself, we
ARE the seeing.

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:59.410
I am not a thing that dies and becomes scattered,
I AM death and I AM the scattering
