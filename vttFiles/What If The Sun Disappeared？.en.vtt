00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.390
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:10.320
Gravity is a property of matter, anything
with mass. This includes the Moon, Earth,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:19.460
Jupiter, the Sun, and even you - your body.
In fact, if you kinda like somebody, have

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:27.130
them stand 3/4 of a millimeter away from you.
At that distance, cumulatively, every atom

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.340
in your body and every atom in their body
will draw you two together with the same gravitational

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.500
force that the Sun is exerting on you right now.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.030
Of course, we don't feel either of those forces
because compared to the gravitational influence

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.789
of the Earth, they are basically nothing.
You don't need to concern yourself with the gravitational

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:55.329
attraction between you and someone you're
hugging, or, your individual body and the

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.649
Sun, 150 million kilometres away.
In fact, the Sun may as well not exist.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.439
What if the Sun disappeared?

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.680
Well, to be sure, it's not going to happen.
The Sun will die billions of years from now

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.430
by expanding, boiling off our oceans
and swallowing the Earth whole.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:22.210
The Sun is not going to simply disappear.
Matter and energy don't vanish. Of course,

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.159
matter can quantum tunnel to different locations,
but on the scale of the Sun there is not

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.030
enough time in the lifetime of millions and
billions of universes for such a probability

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.899
to even be worth discussing.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.100
But let's discuss it anyway, as a thought
experiment to determine how the Earth would

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:48.350
get along with no Sun.
What will the Earth do and what can it do alone?

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.140
At the exact moment that the Sun disappeared,
we would have no idea. Because it takes light

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.439
from the Sun 8 minutes and 20 seconds to
reach Earth. So, for a little over 8 minutes

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:08.149
after the Sun disappeared, we would have no
idea. Once we did, confusion and mass panic

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.009
would, most likely, ensue.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.940
The Sun's gravitational grasp on our planet
would also take 8 minutes and 20 seconds to

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.500
end. This is because gravity waves propagate
at the speed of light. So, the very moment

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.910
we saw our Sun disappear, we would also lose
its gravitational influence and Earth would

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.730
fly out in a straight line,
tangent to wherever it was in its orbit.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.230
The finite speed of light and gravity mean
that as panic and fear spread across the Earth

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.610
at the loss of our Sun, we could still, for
a while, look up into the sky and see our planetary

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.430
buddies, further out, continuing to operate
as if nothing had happened.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.849
For instance, Jupiter would continue orbiting
and reflecting light from a Sun that no longer

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.420
existed for about 30 minutes after the Earth
already knew the Sun was gone. And, depending

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.780
on where Jupiter was in its orbit, it would
take another 30 minutes to an hour for us

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.830
to watch the reflected light of Jupiter snuff out.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.379
With no moonlight or sunlight, the universe
itself would be our only source of visible

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:18.659
light from space.

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:26.759
In 2004, Abdul Ahad calculated that the Milky
Way contributes about as much light as 1/300th

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.739
of a full Moon. So there would be enough light
from space for us to see around a bit. But,

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.280
of course, electricity and fossil fuels would
still be usable for a while. So, cities and

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.629
towns could continue to be lit by manmade
sources, just like a typical night; except,

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.189
it would be night everywhere.

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:53.629
Photosynthesis would stop immediately, and
this is huge. I had a great discussion about

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:58.129
this video with Henry from MinutePhysics,
and the new channel MinuteEarth. If you're

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.739
not subscribed to MinuteEarth, you definitely should be.

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:08.450
In one of his episodes there, he mentions
that 99.9% of the natural productivity on

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.110
Earth is done by photosynthesis, which requires
the Sun. Without the Sun, plants would no

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:21.550
longer be able to inhale carbon dioxide and
exhale life-sustaining oxygen.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:28.880
But, don't worry. Collectively, all of us
humans, all 7 billion of us, breathe in about

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:37.100
6 trillion kilos of oxygen every year.
But our atmosphere contains a whopping quintillion

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.200
kilos of oxygen. So, even without photosynthesis,
and, including all the other animals, and

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.000
insects, and microorganisms that consume oxygen,
it would take us thousands of years to run

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.840
out.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.200
The poor plants themselves would be much
worse off. Without the Sun, most of them would

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.920
die within days or weeks. Except for large
plants. Giants trees, for instance, contain

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.600
enough sugar for energy that they could technically
live in the dark for years. Their problem

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.370
is going to be that the Earth will get quite
cold. In fact, mighty trees would freeze to

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:21.130
death. Their blood, the water and sap inside
of them, solidify way before they died of starvation.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:27.810
Right now, with our Sun, the average surface
temperature on Earth, hot places and cold

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.770
places, and different seasons all considered,
is an arguably comfortable 14 to 15 degrees

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.220
Celsius.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.760
Without the Sun to add energy, the Earth would
radiate away heat exponentially, meaning

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:47.060
it would go fast at first and then happen
more and more slowly. By the end of the first

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:53.120
week without the Sun, the average surface
temperature across Earth would be freezing.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.400
Zero Celsius, 32 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Now, temperature's like this happen all the time

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.900
on Earth, we're used to it. Panic and fear 
and looters and anarchy aside, for the first

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.770
few days or months, we could get by.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:13.590
But by the end of the first year without
the Sun, the average global surface temperature

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.660
would be -73 degrees Celsius, -100 Fahrenheit.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:24.760
The best option, really, would be to move
to geothermal areas like Yellowstone or Iceland.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:31.180
These places would be the few safe havens
for human life after the Sun. Nearly all life

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:39.840
on Earth exists because of, and is dependent
upon, extraterrestrial energy: the Sun. But

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:46.350
the Earth produces its own heat. Despite floating
in the coldness of space for billions of years,

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.750
down below the crust the Earth is quite warm.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:55.470
20% of this warmth came from the fact that
when the Earth formed, mass crushed so tightly

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:01.140
in the middle that the pressure liquified rock.
The other 80% of Earth's internal heat

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:06.100
comes from that fact that deep in its core,
radioactive elements decay, providing the

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:11.380
energy needed to keep the Earth's core at
5,000 degrees Celsius.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.600
Anyone who failed to secure a position within
one of these bastions of warmth, or, perhaps,

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:22.550
underground in a community warmed and powered
by nuclear fuel, would likely be dead within

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.410
the first year of no Sun.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:33.510
In the next 10 or 20 years things would start
to get wet with dew. But not with glorious

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:40.990
water droplets. Instead, droplets of liquid air.
The air would literally become cold enough

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:47.500
for the gasses that make it up to condense,
or form clouds and precipitate, first as rain,

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.900
and then as it got colder and colder,
eventually, as snow.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:58.250
In Fritz Leiber's famous science-fiction short
story "A Pail of Air," this has already happened.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:03.460
The Earth was ripped away from the Sun, and,
in order to survive, a family must go outdoors

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:09.910
in a special suit and scoop up a pale of just
the oxygen snow, bring it back in, and place

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:14.100
it over a fire to warm and allow them to breathe.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:20.790
A year or so after the sun disappeared, Earth's
oceans will have frozen over. Ice all the

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:28.840
way across. But ice is less dense than liquid
water, which means that ice floats. And ice

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:37.360
is a pretty decent insulator.
So, for billions of years after the Sun disappeared, liquid

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.830
water could still exist at the bottom of our
oceans, protected and insulated from space

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:49.520
by miles of ice above it, and warmed by vents
on the ocean floor that spew water out, super

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.270
heated by Earth's interior.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:09:00.890
This would continue on Earth for a very, very
long time - Sun or no Sun. Instead of becoming

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:07.890
frozen and lifeless, extremophiles, like microbes,
that live around hydrothermal vents deep in

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:13.200
the ocean, would be fine. They live deep in
the ocean, far below the point where sunlight

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:20.210
can penetrate, and they make energy not through
photosynthesis, but via chemosynthesis - converting

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:25.430
heat and methane and sulphur into the energy
they need. They are then eaten by clams and

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:26.250
tubeworms.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:32.280
Extremophiles deposit minerals back into the
vents, meaning that their food chain is complete.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:40.120
It's a circle. It's independent of the Sun.
Earthlings like them would thrive if the Sun

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:45.150
were to disappear. They would live just fine
without every knowing that the Sun was gone.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:51.200
Or, honestly, without ever even knowing it
existed in the first place.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:58.980
It's amazing to think that life, here on Earth,
all alone, flying through space with no Sun,

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:07.340
would kind of be fine. Far from becoming a
frozen dead rock, or a boring dormant seed,

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:14.440
the Earth would be a spaceship, carrying living
passengers with enough geothermal heat for

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.430
billions of years of life.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:22.240
If the Sun disappeared, spaceship Earth would
fly out in a straight line covering about

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:31.210
30 kilometres every single second. After just 1 billion
years, it will have covered 900 quadrillion

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:38.870
kilometres or about 100,000 lightyears - a trip that
could potentially take it all the way across

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:46.730
our galaxy, near thousands of stars.
And nothing's to say it couldn't fall into orbit around one,

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:55.840
thaw out, and allow its still-living extremophiles
to proliferate life on Earth all over again;

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:01.660
maybe one day developing life intelligent
enough to uncover whatever is left of our

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:05.480
lives.
Maybe they could even find this very video.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.620
In which case, hi, uh, you're welcome

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:15.400
for this video about your planet's history and journey.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.500
And, um, as always,

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:19.820
 thanks for watching.
