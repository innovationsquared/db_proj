Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And today I released a brand new

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:07.770
Vsauce Leanback. A playlist of
educational videos from all over YouTube

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.809
that I think are cool

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.080
and I host sort of like a Vsauce TV show.
You can start that by clicking the box up in

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.809
the corner

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.320
or the link at the top of this video's
description. But before that,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.880
I wanna talk about the Shepard tone.
It's a sound

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.619
made out of multiple sine waves that
play a trick on us.

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.939
See, what they do is continuously rise in pitch

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.150
and then every so often one of them
drops down an octave,

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.190
but our brains don't perceive that because
the other two

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.540
continue rising and cover for it.
The sine waves take turns dropping down an

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.170
octave,

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.710
producing a sonic barber pole, a noise

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.989
that appears to keep rising in pitch for
ever and ever

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.409
without ever actually going anywhere.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.730
I was reminded of it this week by
FallingFalling.com,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.350
a creation of Internet artist New Rafael,
where the Shepard tone

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.720
seems to go down and fall forever.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.900
Rafael also made some other cool sites,
like OutInTheWind.com.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.480
Here, there's nothing except for dismissing

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.400
wind that slowly erodes your cursor. Okay, now
some of you may already know this, but in

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.030
America

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.110
we say "ADIdas," whereas the rest of the world says

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.200
"adiDAS." And no, it does not stand for "all
day I dream about soccer."

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.800
That's just a backronym, an acronym made
up for a word that already exists.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.530
Instead, it's named after a person, which
is why people pronounce "adiDAS."

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.229
It's named after Adi Dassler, a German guy
who got in a fight with his brother,

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.810
so his brother rude off, went across the
river and started his own athletic company,

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.880
known as PUMA.
That's right. Adidas

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.369
and Puma came from the same town,
from the same

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.420
family. Finally, before the Leanback, I
wanna share this USB typewriter with you.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.660
It's a really cool device

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.050
that plugs into your computer and works
like a normal keyboard, except at the

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.220
same time

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.210
it keeps a hard copy for your records.
It even works with an iPad.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.570
Alright, now it's time to watch the
Vsauce Leanback. You can click here

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.220
to start it.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.140
I'll meet you over there.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.300
And as always,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.480
thanks for watching.
