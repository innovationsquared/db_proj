Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:07.260
And subscribing to Vsauce is a no-brainer, or is it?

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.130
I mean,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.750
you would need your brain to understand the
words that I was speaking, and you would need

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.310
your brain to decide whether or not you liked
what you were hearing. You would also need

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.830
your brain to move your muscles in just the
right way to click the subscribe button.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.920
In fact, you need your brain to do a lot of stuff and without a brain, well, you can't do much

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:37.170
of anything at all. So, literally speaking,
is there really such a thing as a "no-brainer?"

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:44.920
Let's begin with no-header's...decapitation.
It's a macabre subject, I know, but what's

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:54.540
the matter? Are you chicken? Ok, good.
Because Mike certainly was. In 1945, farmer Lloyd

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:01.100
Olsen went out to grab a chicken for supper.
He cut the chicken's head off and it didn't

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.340
die. Mike The Headless Chicken lived for another
18 months. He toured the country and surprised

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.880
onlookers. He could walk and perch and was
fed by putting little drops of water or pieces

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.159
of grain down his throat. But here's the thing.
Mike The Headless Chicken's actions

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.869
weren't a no-brainer, because even though
he didn't have much of what we would call

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.029
a "head" left,
he did have a bit of his brain stem.

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:34.769
If we want a clearer no-brainer, we're going
to have to look at an even more simple creature,

00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:39.749
the cockroach. These guys don't even breath
through their heads so, without one, they're

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:44.749
fine. Instead, they breath through holes all
over their bodies. And instead of being controlled

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:49.849
by a big, massive brain, they have little
bundles of nerves, ganglia, throughout their

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:56.609
body, and so, even without any head parts,
even when completely decapitated, a cockroach

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:03.820
can live for weeks. It can walk around, respond
to movement. Really its only problem is that

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.799
without its head it will eventually starve to death.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:15.580
Us humans are not nearly as fortunate. Without
a head and brain we die within seconds, if

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.319
not instantly. But before you get jealous,
keep in mind that with our heads intact, we

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:29.559
are capable of some actions that don't necessarily
require the brain: reflexes. When you snap

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:36.809
your finger, your finger moves at about 20
mph. And a really big sneeze can expel air

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:46.939
at nearly 30-40 mph. But nerve impulses, they're
really quick. They can clock in at 250 mph,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.000
but sometimes, that's not even fast enough.
For instance, if you accidentally put your

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.160
hand on a hot stove, cells are dying quickly.
And 250 mph doesn't cut it, you need to take

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.420
an action fast. It's not worth it to tell
your brain what's happening right away. And

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.220
so instead, your immediate reaction to pull
away is mediated by other parts of your nervous

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:18.220
system. The same can be said for involuntary
and unconscious processes.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.960
So, in a way, these unconscious, involuntary,
or reflexive behaviors could be considered

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:33.239
no-brainers. But I'm not quite satisfied
yet because they still require that your brain

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:41.759
be there, keeping you alive. So, what if you
weren't alive? Well, in your dead, brainless

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.140
body, your muscle cells still contain a little
bit of energy in the form of ATP.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:56.560
Backyard Brains, right here on YouTube, demonstrates
this with insect parts. This leg is no longer

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.400
connected to a brain or a body, but energy
remains in the cells. And so, researchers

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:08.280
can detect electrical signals when the leg
is touched or even simply breathed on.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.520
"Whoa, that popping sound you're hearing is
the spontaneous discharge rate of the living

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.460
neurons in the still-living leg."

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:21.520
The muscle cells of a human limb would respond
in just the same way. But you don't need wires

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:28.530
to observe behavior like this. Salt can also
do the trick. The introduction of sodium ions

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.780
can cause a process similar to an action-potential
in a living animal. Salt added to these fresh

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:41.780
frog legs makes them dance, though not for
very long. The cells will eventually run out

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:49.040
of energy or simply decay. But to be sure,
there are many other brief candidates for

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:56.040
no-brainers at the moment of death. For instance,
muscles relaxing, causing a person to

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:03.420
soil themselves. Technically, a no-brainer. But
it's a misconception that a corpse continues

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.920
to grow fingernails and hair. Instead, it's
actually the skin itself shrinking as it

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.490
dries, making hair and nails appear longer.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.160
But let's take a closer look at these skin cells,
because we might be on to a quite satisfactory

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.970
no-brainer. Your skin cells live on the periphery
of your body and they don't require a constant

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.330
stream of new nutrients from your blood.
And so even though you are dead and your brain

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.750
is no longer calling the shots, your skin
cells can continue to live, gathering nutrients

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:44.130
through osmosis and dividing for days.
In fact, you can harvest skin cells from a corpse

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.170
after 24 hours.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:53.400
On a related note - digestion.
Sure, a lot of the digestive process is completed by you

00:05:53.410 --> 00:06:00.340
being alive and having a nervous system that
works. But part of the work is done by bacteria

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:07.020
that just happens to live inside your gut.
And when you're dead or your brain is gone,

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:14.700
they'll continue digesting.
So, in a way, making poop, at least part of that process,

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.160
is a no-brainer.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:22.460
But here's the thing. These bacteria that
live inside you are foreign bacteria.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.740
Are they you?

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:30.180
For that matter, what about the
skin cells that can continue to live after you're dead?

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.620
Are they you or are they merely cells
that you have made a good home for?

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:43.440
We're getting pretty philosophical here because
we're basically asking if you are merely your

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:49.810
brain and everything else that goes on when
you no longer have one is just other stuff

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.150
that you aren't doing?

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:59.620
You could argue that without a brain your body
no longer has your intentions. It no longer

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:07.500
does things because you have decided to do them.
In other words, a no-brainer may be

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:14.980
impossible for you to do,
because it requires not using you.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.620
If you are merely what your brain does and
not what your cells do off on their own when

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:31.120
the brain is gone then, in a way, being you,
being alive, is a yes-brainer.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:39.040
Another great yes-brainer is checking out Vsauce3.
You can find some scientific video

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:45.960
game analysis, some gamer LÃœT and some pretty
cool apps to download. Go check that out.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:46.760
And as always,

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.280
thanks for watching.
