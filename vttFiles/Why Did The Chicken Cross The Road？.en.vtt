Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.420
I've got a question for you.
Why did the chicken cross the road?

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.520
Brilliant question. Let's find out why.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.620
Historically, the chicken crossed the road
to get to the other side. Has anybody ever

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.380
laughed at that joke? Why has it become so
famous? And, for that matter, who cares? Why

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.930
would you want to investigate why things are
funny? As E.B. White said "analyzing humor

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.840
is like dissecting a frog - few people are
interested, and the frog dies."

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.440
But I want to dive into the guts of this chicken
joke because today it is so famous, it is

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.790
practically shorthand for comedy. And people
frequently consider it either the worst joke

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.520
of all time or the oldest joke.
But neither of those is true.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.520
But first things first. The chicken joke
isn't technically even a joke. It's an "anti-joke."

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:01.720
It's a joke about jokes. You see, we expect
a joke to surprise us, to flip things around

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.859
or use word play. But to get to the other
side is just obvious, it's mundane, which,

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:14.149
by itself, can be pretty funny. To make this
more clear, let's take a look at anti-joke

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:21.929
chicken. "What's blue and smells like red
paint? Blue paint." You see, you expect a

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:28.399
typical joke-y punch line, but instead what
you get is hilariously serious. Anti-Joke

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:34.840
Cat is another good one. "Knock knock." "Who's
there?" "Lettuce." "That's impossible."

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.720
"Yo momma's so fat, we are all extremely concerned
for her health." Anti-jokes can also be used

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.319
for psychological experiments right at home.
You may have heard of this one already, the

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:53.520
"no soap, radio" joke. Here's how it works.
Get a couple of your friends together and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.919
tell them to all laugh when you're done telling
the joke, no matter what. Then, go find a

00:01:57.919 --> 00:02:02.809
target who's not in on it and tell them some
version of a joke like this: "Two polar bears

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:09.809
were sitting in a bathtub. The first one says
"pass the soap." The second one says "no soap,

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:15.519
radio."" At this point, you and your friends
should start laughing uproariously, meaning

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.519
the target has one of two choices- either
be afraid of looking dumb and laugh along

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.849
anyway or say they're confused, at which
point you should tell them "what, you don't

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:31.319
get it?" and keep laughing. You wait until
the target gives into peer pressure and succumbs

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:38.319
to mob mentality and joins, despite the fact
that "no soap, radio" is actually nonsense.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.700
As for being the oldest joke in the book,
"why did the chicken cross the road?" is far

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.760
from it. Tt's only about 160 some odd-years
old. It first appeared in print in The Knickerbocker

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.760
as a conundrum that really isn't one - an anti-joke.
If you want to look for the oldest joke ever

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.440
to appear in print, we're going to have to
go back 4,000 years to read some ancient Sumerian

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.480
proverbs.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.260
The joke is essentially a cautionary tale
to never expect anything to be perfect. It

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.820
goes like this: "Something which has never
occurred since time immemorial: a young woman

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:24.249
did not fart in her husband's embrace." So...yeah,
the earliest known joke is a joke about a

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:28.389
woman farting in a guy's lap. So...cool...

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:34.680
All I'm sure of is that our proverbial chicken
did not have Agyrophobia. That's the fear of crossing

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:40.170
streets. But maybe the chicken should have.
I mean, crossing the road could be quite dangerous

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.709
for a little bird, which leads us to a quite
darker interpretation of the joke. Maybe this

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:53.709
chicken knew of the danger of crossing the
road. Maybe he knew what could happen. Maybe

00:03:53.769 --> 00:04:01.659
he was sad or lonely or knew what his fate
was. And so he decided to take control and

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:07.859
end it himself 
and crossed the road to get to the other side.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.020

them tick away. But let's get back to the

00:04:24.769 --> 00:04:25.609
joke.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.300
Perhaps a better question than "why did the
chicken cross the road" is "why wouldn't chickens

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.729
be crossing the road?" I mean, to be sure,
the Earth is a big place and less than 1

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:42.689
percent of it is even paved, but there are
quite a few chickens on Earth.

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:49.920
To put this in perspective, there are about
500 million cats and, as far as we go, there

00:04:50.030 --> 00:05:00.479
are 7 billion humans. But chickens?
There are 24 billion chickens. We're outnumbered

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:06.779
more than 3:1. But if we cooked up every
single chicken alive on Earth right now, we

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:13.460
could fill enough KFC 16-piece buckets to
form a stack of them going to the Moon and

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:20.480
back three times. Unbelievable, right?
I mean, they all fit so nicely here on Earth's

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:27.770
surface, walking around with their characteristically
lean meat, which, because fat contributes so

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.750
much more flavor to a piece of meat than the
muscle does, may explain why chicken is such

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:38.810
a great generic meat flavor and why so many
other exotic meats we try later tend to taste

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:39.740
like chicken.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.099
But let's get back to the question in this
video's title. Why did the chicken cross the

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:50.220
road? Well, to get to the other side, sure,
but there are many different motivations a

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.620
chicken could have for going to the other
side. Maybe it was looking for food, maybe

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:00.919
it was being chased by a predator. What matters
though is that we can never know because there

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:08.019
is no chicken. It's purely hypothetical, as
opposed to the equally famous "Mary Had a

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.720
Little Lamb," in which the lamb,
and Mary, were real people.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:18.840
Mary Sawyer was an actual student at The Redstone
School in Massachusetts and one day her brother

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.879
encouraged her to bring her lamb to school.
Her fellow students were amused, as was visiting

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:29.289
student John Roulstone
who wrote "Mary Had a Little Lamb."

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:34.979
We have actual documentation of those real
people and events, but this chicken never

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:40.220
even really existed. So, asking why the chicken
crossed the road is just like asking "why

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.430
did the original writer decide that it should
be a chicken crossing a road?" Which means

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:50.060
that the chicken crossed the road because some
comedian in the 19th century decided that

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.300
you would probably think about it too much,
making the mundane "to get to the other side"

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.440
answer quite surprising.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:04.100
To explain this, let's look at a computational
neural explanation of humor. In order to effectively

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:09.439
manage resources, our brains stay a few steps
ahead of what we're hearing, estimating what

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:13.280
kind of outcomes are possible. But when we
discover that we're actually being told a

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.159
joke, and none of our paths were the correct
version of what was being told, all of that

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:23.120
neural network energy needs to dissipate
and according to some theorists, that energy

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.700
moves into motor cortex,
causing convulsions - laughter.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:33.280
Unfortunately, our poor chicken friend doesn't
illicit that response from us anymore because

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.879
we've all heard the joke. We know what to
expect when the joke begins. But we should

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:43.720
be proud of our chicken friend and the unknown
author who thought him up, because even though

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:49.330
the joke is so famous it's no longer funny,
even at a neurological level, it still stands

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:55.790
as a testament to just how complicated and
clever our comedy can be. Keep laughing.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:56.850
And as always,

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.870
thanks for watching.
