00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.080
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
Where are your fingers?

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.080
Seriously. It's a pretty easy question.
You should be able to answer it.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.700
But how do you know?
How does

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.630
anyone know anything? You might say, well,
I know where my fingers are. I'm looking

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.330
right at them.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.269
Or, I can touch them, I can feel them, they're
right here and that's good.

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.330
Your senses are a great way to learn things.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.869
In fact, we have way more than the usual
five senses we talk about.

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.180
For instance, your kinesthetic sense, proprioception.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.250
This is what the police evaluate
during a field sobriety test.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.160
It allows you to tell where your fingers
and arms and head and legs in your body

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.809
is all in relation to each other

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.320
without having to look or touch other things.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.670
We have way more than five senses, we
have at least twice as many

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.559
and then some. But they're not perfect.
There are optical illusions,

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.090
audio illusions,

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.199
temperature sensation illusions, even tactile

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.610
illusions.
Can you turn your tongue upside down?

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.610
If so, perfect. Try this.
Run your finger

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.140
along the outer edge of the tip of your upside down

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.900
tongue. Your tongue will be able to feel 
your finger, but in the wrong place.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.320
Our brains never needed to develop an understanding

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.880
of upside down tongue touch.
So, when you touch the right side of your tongue

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.180
when it's flipped over to your left side
you perceive a sensation

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.060
on the opposite side, where your tongue 
usually is but isn't

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.619
when it's upside down.
It's pretty freaky and cool

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.299
and a little humbling,
because it shows the limits of the

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:49.210
accuracy of our senses, the only tools we
have to get what's out there

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.890
in here.
The philosophy of knowledge,

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.939
the study of knowing, is called Epistomology.

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.219
Plato famously said that the things we know

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.560
are things that are true, that we believe

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.879
and that we have justification for believing.
those justifications might be

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.849
irrational

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.440
or they might be rational, they might be based on proof,

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.980
but don't get too confident because
proven is not a synonym

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.970
for true. Luckily, there are things that we can know

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.739
without needing proof, without needing to
even leave the house, things that we can

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:27.930
know as true

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.510
by reason alone.
These are things that we know

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.160
a priori.
An example would be the statement

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.379
"all bachelors are unmarried."
I don't have to go survey

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.379
every bachelor on earth to know that that is true.

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.129
All bachelors are unmarried
because that's how we define

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.540
the word bachelor. 
Of course, you have to know what the words

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.540
bachelor and unmarried mean in the first place.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.650
Oh, you do? Okay. Perfect. That's great.
But

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.209
how do you know?
This time I mean

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.769
functionally, how do you know?
Where is knowledge biologically

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.349
in the brain?
What are memories made out of?

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.120
We are a long way from being able to
answer that question completely

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.840
but research has shown that memories
don't exist in the brain in single

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.159
locations.
Instead, what we call

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.170
a memory is likely made up of many

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.840
different complex relationships all over
the brain between lots of brain cells,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.860
neurones. A major cellular mechanism
thought to underlie the formation of

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.650
memories

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.790
is long-term potentiation or

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.860
LTP.
When one neurone stimulates another neurone

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.620
repeatedly that signal can be enhanced overtime

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.409
LTP, wiring them more strongly together

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.519
and that connection can last a long time, even

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.989
an entire lifetime.
A collection of different brain cells,

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.290
neurones that fire together in a particular order

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.489
over and over again frequently and repeatedly

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.750
can achieve long-term potentiation, becoming

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.549
more sensitive to each other and more
ready to fire in the exact same way

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.560
later on in the future.
They're a physical thing

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.989
in your brain, firing together more easily

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.430
because you strengthen that pattern of firing.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.220
You memorized.
This branching forest of firing friends

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.419
looks messy, but look closer.
It could be the memory

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.610
of your first kiss.
A living souvenir

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.770
of the event.
If I were to go into your brain and cut out

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.320
those cells, could I make you forget your first kiss

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.430
or could I make you forget where your fingers are?

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.440
Only if I cut out a lot of your brain.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.550
Because memories aren't just stored in one
relationship, they're stored

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.940
all over the brain. The events leading up
to your first kiss are stored in one

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:00.650
network,

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.250
the way it felt to the way it smelled in
different networks, all added up together

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.740
making what you call the memory of your first kiss.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.080
How many memories can you fit

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.870
inside your head?
What is the storage capacity

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.669
of the human brain?
The best we can do is a rough

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.330
estimate, but given the number of
neurons in the brain involved with

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.070
memory

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.509
and the number of different connections
a single neurone can make

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:30.650
Paul Reber at Northwestern University estimated

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.930
that we can store the digital equivalent of about 2.5

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.120
petabytes of information.
That's the equivalent of recording a TV channel

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.490
continuously for 300 years.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.100
That's a lot of information.
That is a lot of information about

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.340
skills you can do and facts and people you've met,

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.430
things in the real world.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.539
The world is real, right?

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.870
How do you know?
It's a difficult question,

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.440
but it's not rocket science.
Instead, it is

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.470
asking whether or not rocket scientists
even exist in the first place.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.759
The theory that the Sun moved around the earth

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:20.340
worked great. It predicted that the Sun
would rise every morning

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.759
and it did. It wasn't until later that we
realized what we thought was true

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:29.280
might not be.
So, do we

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.710
or will we ever know true reality

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.310
or are we stuck in a world where the
best we can do is be

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:42.139
approximately true? Discovering more and
more useful theories every day but never

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:43.569
actually reaching

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:48.199
true objective actual reality.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:52.180
Can science or reason ever prove convincingly

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.560
that your friends and YouTube videos and your fingers

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.180
actually exist beyond your mind?
That you don't just live

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.699
in the matrix?

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:07.060
No.
Your mind is all that you have,

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.240
even if you use instruments, like a telescope

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.509
or particle accelerators.
The final stop

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:16.910
for all of that information is ultimately

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.560
you.
You are alone in your own brain,

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.120
which technically makes it impossible to prove that

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.130
anything else exists.
It's called

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:31.039
the egocentric predicament.
Everything you know

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:34.440
about the world out there depends on

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.610
and is created inside your brain.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.750
This mattered so much to Charles Sanders Peirce
that he drew a line

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.990
between reality, the way the universe truly is,

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:51.330
and what he called the phaneron,
the world as filtered through our senses

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.690
and bodies, the only information we can get.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:58.069
If you want to speak with certainty you live in,

00:07:58.069 --> 00:08:01.370
that is you react to and remember and experience your

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:04.650
phaneron, not reality.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.669
The belief that only you exist

00:08:07.669 --> 00:08:11.460
and everything else, food, the universe,
your friends are all

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.280
figments of your mind is called
solipsism.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.040
There is no way to convince

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.210
a solipsist that the outside world

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.460
is real.
And there is no way to convince someone who

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:30.060
doubts that the universe wasn't created
just three seconds ago

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:34.140
along with all of our memories.
It's a frightening realization

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.430
that we don't always know how to deal with.
There's even

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:41.010
The Matrix defense.
In 2002

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:44.640
Tonda Lynn Ansley shot and killed her landlady.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.570
She argued that she believed she was in
the matrix, that her crimes

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.950
weren't real.
By using the matrix defense

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.890
she was found not guilty

00:08:55.890 --> 00:09:00.510
by reason of insanity, because the
opposite view is just way more healthy

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.570
and common.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.930
It's called realism.
Realism is the belief that the

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:08.490
outside world exists independently of your own

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:12.120
phaneron.
Rocks and stars and Thora Birch

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.380
would continue to exist even if you weren't around

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.459
to experience them.
But you cannot

00:09:18.459 --> 00:09:22.620
know realism is true.
All you can do

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:27.399
is believe.
Martin Gardner, a great source for math magic tricks,

00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:31.700
explained that he is not a solipsist
because realism is just way more

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.110
convenient

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.320
and healthy and it works.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.660
As to whether it bothered him that he
could never know realism was true,

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.899
he wrote "if you ask me to tell you
anything about the nature of what lies

00:09:44.899 --> 00:09:46.720
beyond the phaneron,

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:52.180
my answer is how should I know?
I'm not dismayed by ultimate mysteries,

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.339
I can no more grasp what is behind such questions

00:09:55.339 --> 00:09:59.450
as my cat can understand what is
behind the clatter i make

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:03.390
while I type this paragraph."
Humble stuff.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.959
What strikes me

00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:09.269
is the cat.
Cats do not understand keyboards,

00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:12.509
but they know the keyboards are a fun place to be.

00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:16.100
It's a great way to get the attention
of a human, they're warm

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.529
and exciting, surrounded by noises and
flashing lights plus

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:23.220
cats love to get their scent
on whatever they can,

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.990
a mark of their existence.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:30.280
We aren't that much different,
except instead of keyboards

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.390
we have the mysteries of the universe.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:37.600
We will never be able to understand all
of them. We won't be able to ever answer

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.260
every single question,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.640
but walking around in those questions, exploring them,

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.210
is fun.
It feels good.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.470
And as always,

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:48.790
thanks for watching.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:59.810
Do you want more unanswered questions?
Well, you're in luck.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:04.200
Today, nine other amazing channels on
YouTube have made videos

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.630
about questions we still haven't fully answered.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.300
Alltime10s has organized them and to watch them all
