00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.610
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. The dog

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.580
that played Toto in The Wizard of Oz was
credited

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.559
as Toto, but in reality the dog's name

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.839
was Terry. And when Terry died in 1945

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.970
her owner and trainer Carl Spitz buried
her on his ranch

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.730
in Los Angeles. But in 1958

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.300
the Ventura Highway was constructed
right

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.789
through Terry's grave. Her remains were

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.850
disturbed and have never been found.
Fifty-three years later

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.030
a memorial was erected in Hollywood
Forever Cemetery

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.600
in her honor but because she isn't burried

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.640
there, the memorial is not a grave. It's
what's known

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.760
as a cenotaph, an empty

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.820
tomb. I was reminded of Toto's

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.680
cenotaph when I saw the cenotaph of Philopappos, atop the Hill of the Muses

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.829
in Athens. You see, I was recently in
Greece

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.930
talking about YouTube with YouTube
creators. The

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.510
all seen eye of Guy came along and we
visited

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.729
the Acropolis, a Lion Gate - nearly a
thousand years older than the Acropolis.

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.960
The earliest known analog computer.
Plenty of beautiful

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.479
cats and I even took a selfie in

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.720
Delphi. I've seen all of these things and

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.009
how old they were, it made me wonder how
will we

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.200
be remembered.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.620
How will future archaeologists react to
the ruins of today's

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.120
society they find thousands of years
from now.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.120
Will they do a good job piecing it

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.230
together? Will anything about you in
particular

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.420
be remembered? And, for that matter,

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.520
how do we even know that the past really
happened?

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.390
Not just the way we think it happened,
but it all.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.060
Seriously, can you prove that the universe
wasn't created

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.720
last Thursday? That everything - every
person, every memory you have,

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.020
every photo you've taken didn't just pop in
into existence

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.030
last week or five minutes ago?

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.710
Last Thursdayism is the belief that
the universe was created

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.630
last Thursday. It doesn't have actual

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.709
followers or rituals but proving it
wrong

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.720
is impossible. Not because the universe

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.940
actually was created last Thursday but
because Last

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.100
Thursdayism is not also falsifiable.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.650
It cannot be shown to be false. In the
evidence you bring up against it can be

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.790
explained away as part of the

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.739
everything that was created last
Thursday.

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.110
Many people believe that in order for a
theory

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.540
and explanation to be scientific it must
be possible

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.840
to refute it, to prove it wrong, to test it.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.850
So, instead, Last Thursdayism falls
into the domain

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.870
of philosophy, where luckily

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.209
there are razors - little rules of

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.530
thumb that help shave off unlikely
explanations.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.400
The most famous is Occam's Razor. When
faced with the choice between

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.769
explanations,

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.480
choose the one that requires diffused
assumptions.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.870
Occam's Razor can shave off

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.420
last Thursdayism because it requires

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.109
fewer assumptions to believe that, say,
this beehive

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.719
tomb was constructed way back in the
Bronze Age

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:42.859
and that I just visited it later than it
does to believe that

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.470
the tomb, my memories of it and this
footage of me

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.090
inside it just happen to coincidentally
pop into existence at the same time

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.299
last Thursday. One of my favourite
philosophical razors

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.799
cuts off so much stuff it's not even

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.840
called a razor. It's called Newton's

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.250
Flaming Laser Sword. It states

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.939
if something cannot be settled by
experiment, then it is not worthy

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:14.439
of debate. So let's move on

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:17.539
to the past. What does Newton's

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.320
Flaming Laser Sword tell us about the
past? I mean, it doesn't exist in the same

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.259
way

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:27.840
gravity or light or protons do. We
can't do experiments on it,

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.340
build control groups, run trials. The past

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.800
just is what it was.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.099
We will one day be the past and no
matter how well we try to record

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.389
our stories ourselves, without

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.860
time machines future archaeologists are
going to have to make a lot of guesses

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:48.699
about us.

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.580
But that's kinda cool.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.200
Future humans will likely know way more
than us today

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.960
about medicine, about exoplanets, about physics.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.350
But one thing they almost surely

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.040
will not know more about than we do is

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.870
today. Will your great great great great
grandkids

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.180
know your name? Will aliens, who visit
Earth

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.700
millions of years after humans leave or
go extinct,

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.250
understand that Animorphs was just

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.680
fiction, and not a history of our people?

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.530
You are destined to become whatever the
future

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.200
thinks you were, if you're lucky.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.889
Vandals, fire, natural disaster,

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.710
conquerors, thieves, all of these forces
obscure facts

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.750
overtime, but no matter how well we tried
to preserve

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.050
today for future history books, there's
one type of

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.950
fog we are unlikely to avoid.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.060
Apathy. Ira Glass put it well

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.890
when he asked his listeners a simple
question: name

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.600
10 people from the 15th century.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.680
We have records of more than 10 people
but to most of us

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.070
they don't matter. In five hundred years

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.010
radio host will be making the same jokes
but about us.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.570
However, there is a legacy
leave behind

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.310
that is irreversible. Immutable,

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.930
and in a way, unforgettable.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.590
To conserve energy, turn off when not in
use.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.120
Or just keep them on. Energy will be
conserved

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.450
no matter what you do. Even if you leave
lights on all year,

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.370
there will be no less or more energy in
the universe.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.729
What's really being conserved when we
turn off lights

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:50.729
are the resources we turn into energy

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:53.830
the lights can use. But if you counted up

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.289
all the energy in the system, before and
after turning the lights on,

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:02.560
it would be the same. Energy also does
something else.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.050
Unless hindered from doing so, energy

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.819
will spread

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:11.529
out - it will disperse. That is,

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:15.169
in so few words, the Second Law of
Thermodynamics.

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:20.159
It's how our universe works. It's why
things that happen spontaneously

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:23.319
do. Energy spreads.

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:27.379
Even when a process locally concentrates
energy,

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:30.550
like when a crystal forms or life grows,

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.150
the Second Law isn't violated because these
processes

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.960
aren't independent from the larger world
around them. They aren't

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:43.099
100 percent efficient. Hindrances can hold
back the inevitable spread of energy for a

00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:45.889
long time. The Second Law doesn't say

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:49.849
when energy will disperse - just that when it can, 

00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:53.669
oh it will. Balloons will deflate,

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:58.289
objects will fall, hot objects will cool
down,

00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:03.129
and perfume sprayed across the room will
eventually migrate to your nose

00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:07.219
even in really still air. How much

00:08:07.219 --> 00:08:11.159
or how widely energy has spread out is
measured

00:08:11.159 --> 00:08:14.779
in entropy. Entropy is often called

00:08:14.779 --> 00:08:21.229
"disorder", "chaos". But entropy is very
different from macroscopic

00:08:21.229 --> 00:08:24.599
messiness. This deck of cards is

00:08:24.599 --> 00:08:28.560
themed after Greek philosophers. It's
also arranged by

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.069
value and suit - the entire deck. But if I
take the deck

00:08:33.069 --> 00:08:37.050
and shuffle it, that is, disorder it, I
haven't

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.050
actually increased the deck's

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:40.999
entropy,

00:08:40.999 --> 00:08:44.029
because nothing about this deck of cards'

00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:47.800
energy is different than it was before.
However,

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.899
entropy in the greater world around us

00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:54.899
has increased because in order to
shuffle the cards

00:08:54.899 --> 00:08:59.980
my body has to do work. It has to take
energy concentrated in my cells

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.040
and change and disperse that energy into
kinetic energy,

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.649
movement, and a little bit of heat from
my body and from the cards,

00:09:06.649 --> 00:09:11.489
friction, and a little bit of sound
energy - that rustling noise.

00:09:11.489 --> 00:09:16.029
So there's your real legacy.

00:09:16.029 --> 00:09:19.600
Your contribution to the universe's
growing

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.399
entropy. No process will be able to

00:09:23.399 --> 00:09:26.459
undo the net increase in entropy

00:09:26.459 --> 00:09:30.949
you accomplish in your life. History may
forget you,

00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:34.679
or misinterpret your accomplishments, or
what stood for.

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:38.290
The ripples you leave behind may get
redirected

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.999
but the universe will never be able to
forget the

00:09:41.999 --> 00:09:45.740
entropy you add. That's the law.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:49.470
The Second Law of Thermodynamics.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:52.959
Many scientists believe that this means
that eventually

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:57.329
energy - heat - will be completely spread out

00:09:57.329 --> 00:10:02.329
evenly throughout the universe. It will be
the same temperature

00:10:02.329 --> 00:10:06.509
everywhere, and at that point nothing
will be able

00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:09.920
to happen. Because in order for something
to happen

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.170
entropy needs to increase, energy needs
to spread, the move to change.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:18.829
This may be the ultimate fate of the
universe - 

00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:22.389
thermodynamic equilibrium. The

00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:28.930
"Heat Death" of the universe. It's been estimated that
at the rate things happen

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.930
this end the universe will occur in about

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:36.920
8 googol years, and you're contributing
to it

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.899
by simply existing. A funny consequence
of all this

00:10:40.899 --> 00:10:45.560
is the fact that people who aren't very active, people who don't do much but lay

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.360
around

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.980
aren't just being lazy. In a way

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.240
they're being considerate. Sloth

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.040
maybe of vice, but to the universe

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.020
it's a fountain of youth. Choosing to do as little
as possible

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:05.100
means consciously limiting your
contribution

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.300
to the inevitable dispersal of energy and
thus

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.500
in a teeny-tiny way postponing

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.660
the "Heat Death" of our universe.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.760
Relaxing adds time

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:22.250
to the universe's life: in amount of
time, to be fair, almost indistinguishable

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.490
from zero,

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:27.110
but still theoretically real. Being

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.610
lazy will make the universe last

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:33.690
longer. So thanks for

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:38.020
chilling out.  Thanks for taking it easy. And, as always,

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.480
thanks for watching.
