Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And Jake. And Kevin.

00:00:04.409 --> 00:00:06.280
And we are in Santa Monica, which

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.109
of course means that the "V" in "Vsauce"
will stand for the Roman numeral five,

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:13.270
as in five questions

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.690
from you guys.

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:18.850
Our first question comes from "@notch".

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.009
He didn't ask this of me in particular,
but I love how non-intuitive the

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.609
answer is.
Assume

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.980
an Earth that's perfectly spherical

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.709
and a rope, stretched around the equator snugly.

00:00:31.709 --> 00:00:37.989
What would happen if that rope was just,
say, six meters longer? Six meters

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.230
isn't very much,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.450
but because of the relationship
between a circumference

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.699
and a radius,

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.509
six meters of extra rope would allow the
entire rope to not fit snugly around

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:49.450
the earth,

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.320
but one meter above it,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.170
all the way around.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.989
That's cool, but what if instead of a rope

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.260
we used something more rigid, like a structure, a bridge

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.570
and we built the bridge all the way around the Earth.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.500
And then, all at once, destroyed its supports.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.760
Would it

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.109
float?
Clearly the earth's gravity would pull the structure down,

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:18.670
but down is in the opposite direction
for the other side of the bridge.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.150
Well, it turns out

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.560
such a scenario would be incredibly
unstable. Earth's gravity isn't equal

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.399
everywhere, and if you follow @tweetsauce
you saw some great graphs showing

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.100
just how much gravity changes,

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.670
simply based on the density of rock below.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.120
When you factor in the Sun and the Moon,
you wind up with a bridge structure that is

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.460
not gonna stay where it is.
If the bridge itself was indestructible, it would start

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.410
violently hula hooping around the
earth, crushing things. But there's no

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.090
known material strong enough to do that.
Instead, you would wind up with

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.810
bridge pieces flying everywhere.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.860
A sphere around the earth would be a bit
more stable, but a ring?

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.150
Not so much.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.619
The ring, even if spinning, would rapidly
break apart into smaller pieces.

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.959
Last week you guys asked me a question
that I have always wondered.

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.150
Let's say I was stranded in the
mountains, waiting for rescuers to arrive,

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.510
but it was going to take

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.909
a while.
I had plenty of snow and plenty of water,

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.050
but I was hungry -

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.869
dying of starvation -

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:26.510
would it make sense

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.669
to

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:29.819
amputate one of my legs

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.460
and eat it?
I mean,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.959
it kinda makes sense, right?!

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.579
I'd have my entire leg to eat as food,
which would probably fill me up

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.590
and I would have one less limb

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.489
that I would need to keep alive.

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.799
The only problem is that the trauma your
body would endure from the loss of a

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:48.499
limb

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:53.259
would greatly exceed the benefit you would get
by eating the food. You're better off keeping

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:54.060
that limb

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.330
on your body,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.510
because your body's process of using
reserves of energy is more efficient than

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.939
the process of digestion.
So keep the leg on

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:08.659
and let it wither away, keeping you alive.
Don't cut it off and eat it and digest it.

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.109
How does hair know when to stop growing?

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:16.569
It's a good question,

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.660
because the hair on my arm, which

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.730
there's a lot of, never grows any longer than this.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.399
And if I were shave my arm off,
it would grow back and stop

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:27.519
right where it is right now.

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.129
But head hair is different.

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:35.469
For instance, my hair - what's left of it -
would keep growing if I didn't cut it.

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:40.009
But no other animal has that situation.
You don't see wolves out in the forest

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:44.009
saying, wow, look how long my hair is
getting, I better get to the barber shop.

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:48.690
So, why do humans have head hair that grows so long,

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.529
but body hair elsewhere that stops
seemingly right when it's supposed to.

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:54.830
Well, first things first.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.099
The hair on your head will not keep growing for ever.

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.919
Typically around six years of growth is the limit.

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:08.029
When hair grows, it is in what is known as its
anagen phase. And for hair on your

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:10.079
head that phase can last

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.029
up to six years.

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:17.010
But the anagen phase of hair elsewhere
on your body - eyebrows, eyelashes -

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.630
is much shorter.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.449
Except in cases like this guy, whose
eyebrows grove like head hair and

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.569
have allowed him to set the world record 
for longest eyebrows.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.169
Humans probably lost their fur coats,
their thick body hair,

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.419
because it didn't really help us hunting
and running around sweating on the savannah.

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.250
And unlike other animals,
us humans had discovered fire

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.620
and could make clothing

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.999
to keep ourselves warm
without needing a built-in fur coat.

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:54.040
To be sure, long hair that falls over
your ears and neck can keep you warmer.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:00.110
But leading theories also argue
that long head hair may be

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.509
our fault.

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.999
A result of the fact that early humans

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:07.850
picked mates that could grow longer hair on their heads.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.529
Mates that could do that were probably healthier

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:14.389
and in colder climates literally had a built-in hat

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.559
to keep their body warm.

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:20.630
One of the questions I get the most
is about eye floaters.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.550
Those little dots or squiggles that you see 
in your vision, especially when looking at

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.460
a bland scene, like the clear blue sky.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.650
Eye floaters are made out of little fibrals
that occur in your eye

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.809
as you age. And you can't look directly
at them because they're inside the fluid

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:43.080
of your eye. Turning your eye to look
at them simply causes the fluid to move

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.719
and the floater as well.
But the thing about eye floaters that I love the most is

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:49.879
that they are almost always

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:51.389
microscopic.

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:54.159
You can't see them with the naked eye,

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:57.139
except when they are inside

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:58.120
your eye.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.229
If you were to pull an eye floater out,
you wouldn't be able to see it. But in your eye,

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.520
it's close enough to the retina

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.189
to leave a shadow on the retina and
that's what you see when you see eye

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:10.329
floaters.

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:14.680
Finally, how much would Wikipedia weight

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.140
if i printed all the text out

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.610
and bound it into books?
Well luckily,

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.050
there's a Wikipedia article about this very topic.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.240
The English-language Wikipedia contains
about two billion three hundred and

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.169
forty five million words, which,

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.870
if printed at the density of the
Encyclopedia Britannica, would equal

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:36.680
about

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.669
1,759

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:40.740
volumes.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.750
Which would look

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.949
like this.

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:47.520
Altogether they would weigh about 7,000 pounds.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.800
If you're between the ages of 13 and 18,

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.199
you may want to check out

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:53.250
the Google

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.740
Science Fair.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.229
It's an amazing competition.
These guys are great. They actually helped

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:01.439
make that Earth bridge animation for me.

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:02.949
So be sure to check out

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:05.740
GoogleScienceFair.com.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.240
And I'll keep checking out Los Angeles.
I'm here

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.329
with Kevin and Jake from Vsauce2 and 3

00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:12.789
for the first time ever.

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:17.619
The three of us have never been in one
location simultaneously until now, so be

00:07:17.619 --> 00:07:20.799
sure you're subscribed to us, because amazing videos

00:07:20.799 --> 00:07:22.110
will come soon.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.259
And as always, thanks for watching.
