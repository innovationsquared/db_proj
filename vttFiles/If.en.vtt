00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.480
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
Earlier this month

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.350
I travelled to Kourou in French Guiana 
with euronews

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.610
to watch the launch of Vega Rocket,

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.660
if it happened

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.350
while I was there. Waiting at the
observation point with only minutes to go,

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.310
the launch was postponed because of weather.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.470
Even though the rocket scientists were

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.970
using Comic Sans, the rocket it didn't take off

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.949
until the day after I had to be back in London.

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.410
But it made me think.
We can send satellites into orbit

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.969
and people to the moon and predicts solar eclipses

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.409
thousands of years into the future but yet

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:47.859
we cannot reliably predict which way the
wind will be blowing

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:53.559
in the next our or so. How can such
monumental cosmic movements

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.530
light minutes or light years away from
us be understood,

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.619
whereas the weather, which happens in the
very same layer of the atmosphere we

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:04.369
live in every day,

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.610
remains such a mystery?
Well,

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.670
it has to do with the limits of what we know

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.170
and what we can know.
Planetary positions

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.360
and terrestrial weather in the future
are determined by their

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.400
initial conditions.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.360
But over a short time scale predicting
the future position of a planet

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.620
involves fewer variables than the weather.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.990
In order to accurately predict the
weather, you need to know the complete

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.230
and exact conditions

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.460
of every molecule of air on Earth.
How those molecules will interact with each

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.020
other

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.980
and the earth and how they will feedback
and influence themselves by changing

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.630
other molecules. This makes it incredibly
difficult to predict the weather more

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.310
than a week

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.130
in advance.
And this problem isn't going to go away.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.410
It is fundamental to our relationship with the universe.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.250
Given enough time small, unnoticeable,

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.600
unmeasurable, unknowable factors get magnified

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.929
again and again slowly

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.030
until eventually their impact is vastly significant

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.959
and our predictions today are hopeless.

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.520
Neil deGrasse Tyson mentions this in his
brilliant "Death by Black Hole,"

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.660
where he points out that the recoil
from the launch of a single

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.500
space probe can influence our future in
such a way

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.150
that in about 200 million years

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.650
the position of Earth and its orbit around
the Sun will be shifted

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.660
by nearly sixty degrees.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.630
Edward Lorenz gave this phenomenon
its popular name.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.940
"Predictability; Does the Flap of a Butterfly's wings

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.140
in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?"

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.530
The butterfly effect.
A small change,

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.160
like a butterfly deciding to flap its wings,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.200
can lead to a whole chain of events
were bigger

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.380
and bigger processes change just enough
to leave the even more significant

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.810
changes until finally an entire storm

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.310
occurs somewhere different or not

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.720
at all.
The discipline that such thinking

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.000
kick-started is known as chaos theory.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.810
When the present determines the future,
but the approximate

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.820
present does not approximately determine the future.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.170
To us the universe is full

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.799
of "if". But all things considered, we
are pretty good at predicting the future

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.290
and preparing for it, but some things

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.230
are or were prepared for a future
that hasn't occurred yet

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.250
or never did.
And knowing more about those things

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.370
sheds amazing perspective on the limits of our knowledge.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.260
Speaking of limits, let's begin with your life,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.130
carpe diem.
An online tool that when given your birth date

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.769
uses the latest life expectancy data to
give you back

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.829
a grid of squares.
One square represents

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.970
one week - seven days. The lighter ones are
the weeks that you have already

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.989
been alive, the darker ones are what you have left.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.500
Check "sleep" to see how many of your previous

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.580
and future weeks will be spent

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.200
sleeping.
Of course, it's just an approximation,

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.760
it's difficult to know if you will have more

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.010
or fewer weeks to come.
It's hard to know when it will all end.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.710
It's even more difficult to document, unless you are

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.070
Reynaldo Dagsa, a councilman from the Philippines,

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.889
who took this photo of his family on New Year's Day

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.810
at the very same second that he was

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.389
assassinated.
The photo was later used

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.230
to catch the killer.
We can't predict everything,

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.460
but in the event of an anticipated catastrophic

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.460
event - severe weather, an incoming nuclear attack or

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.919
asteroid - how would we all know what was going on?

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.669
Well, many countries have systems in
place to allow them to speak to as many

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.980
people as quickly as possible.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.380
The United States has the Emergency Alert

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.470
System.
When triggered, the system

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.610
interrupts all programming on radio and television

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.000
with messages generated using text-to-speech

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.780
automated voices.
The warning tones are known,

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.659
so what's kind of scary is that today

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.669
we can take a peek

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:48.099
and see what it would look like and what
it would sound like

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:52.000
if a catastrophic event occurred.
In this example

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.150
a nuclear attack that threatened life
across the entire country.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.530
First of all, you would likely here sirens

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.830
and then, as you went tune into, say TV,

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.500
this is what you would hear and see.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.020
We interrupt our programming.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.360
This is a national emergency.
The following message is transmitted at the

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.980
request of the United States government.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.570
This is not a test. A nuclear attack is
occurring against the United States.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.540
Four nuclear missiles have been 
launched from unknown locations

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.750
and are expected to strike the United
States within the next 15 minutes.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:41.050
Due to the uncertain facts of these
missiles, all residents of the United

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.560
States should seek out

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.710
and prepare to take shelter immediately.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.760
Stand by for a message from
the President of the United States.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.020
If a catastrophic event occurred of global proportions,

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.980
what would humanity do next?
Well,

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:08.200
there might be survivors. People hidden
away in fortresses that we have built,

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:08.620
like

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.690
the North American Aerospace Defense Command,

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.000
NORAD.
Built into solid

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.030
granite, shielded by steel plating to
protect computer systems from

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.510
electromagnetic pulses

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.710
and supported on springs, so as to

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.160
safely sway in the event of an earthquake,
NORAD can protect

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.520
humans and equipment from a 30

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.310
megaton nuclear blast just a mile away.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.710
After the event, it's places like this

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:43.670
that would literally be humanity's last,
best chance of continuing life.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:47.310
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is on
the Norwegian island

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.690
of Spitsbergen.
Buried 390 feet

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.570
inside a mountain, it safely stores and protects

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:59.240
250 million individual seeds

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.250
for growing plants and crops, if their vulnerable

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.950
living relatives on the surface are all destroyed.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.580
Soviet technology existed to put people on the Moon,

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.850
of course, they never did.
If

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:18.920
Russia had sent men to the Moon,
they would have walked around on it

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:24.720
looking like this. The Krechet-94
was designed in 1967 but

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.650
never used for Soviet manned lunar excursion.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.370
Russia did, however, sent the first man into space

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.470
and the first woman into outer space.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:38.860
They also sent the first dog into orbit
around the Earth.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.780
Unfortunately, the dog died too soon
after launch due to overheating.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.280
But later they sent Belka and Strelka,

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.410
dogs on a rocket full of living
organisms that became

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.700
the very first to orbit the Earth and return to

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.050
Earth alive.
You can still see them

00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:00.890
today.
The Moscow Cosmonautics Memorial Museum
has the two dogs

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.330
preserved.
Stuffed and on display as

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.610
physical relics of earthlings growing up

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:12.570
and leaving their planet.
I was also lucky enough to visit a restaurant

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:16.880
in Moscow with menus - yep - that used Comic Sans.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.420
Oh, and I ate a star dog, which in the cyrillic

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.600
alphabet looks like it's called crap dosis.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.740
The United States of course did send
people to the Moon,

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.680
but recently we have learned that NASA
at the time didn't know

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.680
with the same certainty as other variables

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.760
whether the first man on the Moon would be able

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:43.910
to leave. Just two days before humanity's
historic moon landing

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:47.890
William Safire was asked to prepare a speech

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:51.180
for President Nixon to read on television to the world

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.610
if Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong

00:09:55.610 --> 00:10:00.230
became stranded on the Moon.
Thirty years later

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:05.000
William Safire explained that Aldrin and
Armstrong were supposed to reunite with

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.110
the command module

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:09.960
orbiting the moon,
but if they couldn't and there was a

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.060
good risk that they couldn't, then they would have to be

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.730
abandoned on the Moon, left to die there

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.190
and

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:23.020
mission control would then have to use
their euphemism

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:26.790
"close down communication"
and the men would have to either

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:30.240
starve to death or commit suicide.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.470
And, so, we prepared for that with the

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:37.540
the speech that I wrote and

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.990
the President was ready to to give that.
Luckily,

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.410
Nixon never had to deliver the Moon disaster speech,

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:48.420
but to read it today, thinking of those two guys

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.740
still alive on the surface of the Moon

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.550
knowing that they will never get back to Earth

00:10:55.550 --> 00:11:00.020
is chiling.
Included in that speech

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.810
were these lines: "fate has ordained

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:07.040
that the men who went to the Moon to
explore in peace

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.560
will stay on the Moon to rest in peace.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.450
These brave men, Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin,

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:18.310
know that there is no hope for their
recovery but they also know that their

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:21.640
is hope for mankind in their sacrifice.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:26.770
In ancient days men looked at the stars
and saw their heroes

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:30.910
in the constellations.
In modern times we do much the same,

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:34.459
but our heroes are epic men of flesh

00:11:34.459 --> 00:11:38.140
and blood.
For every human being who looks up at the moon

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.410
in the nights to come will know that there is some corner

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:47.870
of another world that is forever mankind."
And that's what I took away most from my

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.510
trip to Kourou.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:55.180
Space isn't just a place for zero-g
tricks or imagining sci-fi technology,

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.220
space is ever-expanding

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:02.450
and full of corners of other worlds that could
one day become mankind's,

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:06.910
if we choose to.
And that doesn't minimize Earth.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.910
The Vega rocket I went to see sent up
satellites designed to

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:14.920
test electric solar wind sails for
interplanetary travel,

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.810
as well as satellites built to analyze
the health of Earth's

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.800
vegetation or to predict natural disasters.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.910
Just as our bodies benefit from having
doctors and instruments beyond them that

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:28.350
can

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:32.340
probe, investigate and diagnose, so does the earth.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.540
Launch pads, like the one in Kourou I got to visit,

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:39.470
are really just hospital waiting rooms for

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:44.480
earth. A place where our planet can wait
for researchers and scientists

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.910
to put their tools, their instruments into use,

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:51.110
into orbit.
We may never know

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:54.590
if something will or will not happen, but by

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:58.150
pursuing space, corners of other worlds,

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.260
we gain a perspective that can help us shrink

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.980
the size of that mysterious and often
frightening

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.900
if.and as always

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.180
And as always,

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:10.170
thanks for watching.
