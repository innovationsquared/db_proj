Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And thank you for
clicking on this video. But how many times

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.660
a day do you click? And how many times a day
do you type keys on a keyboard? You might

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.930
be surprised by the answer. And one of the
best ways to know exactly how many actions

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.189
you're taking per day is to use software like WhatPulse.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.730
WhatPulse measures how often you do things.
Keystrokes, mouse clicks. It even measures

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.930
the total distance you've moved your
cursor. It's really fun stuff to track and,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.300
of course, depending on who you are, or what
day it is, or what you do, your totals per

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.760
day will change. But it's been found that,
on average, people who use computers a lot,

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.660
like office workers, type around 5,000 to 10,000
keystrokes every day. And they click a mouse

00:00:52.660 --> 00:01:01.400
about 1,500 to 3,000 times a day. Interestingly,
computer users in the UK typed the most.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:09.320
Sitting down and using a computer - typing,
scrolling, moving the mouse - burns about 20

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.830
more calories an hour than just doing nothing.
I mean, if you do nothing, you're still

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.780
using calories. It takes energy for you to
exist. You have to keep your body temperature

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.270
where it should be, you have to breath, pump
blood. To figure out how many calories it

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.119
takes, per day, for you to just exist, simply
take your weight in pounds and multiply

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:38.810
it by 11. If you want to be more specific,
take your weight in kilograms and multiply

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:48.360
it by .02. What you wind up with is the number
of calories it takes, per minute, to keep

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.440
you existing. That's the number of calories
that you burn every minute doing nothing.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.600
It's not very much. And using a computer doesn't
raise it that much higher, but don't be discouraged,

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.010
because typing and texting can bind us together.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:16.280
We text and type on keyboards a lot. And rapidly.
In fact, every day, 6 billion text messages

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.680
are sent.
And there are only 7 billion people on Earth.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.300
And that's just texting. We'll add keyboard
typing in a little bit later. But I want

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.440
to take a quick detour and talk about the
letters, and the characters, and the keys themselves.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.340
They're not all pressed the same number of
times. Some are more common than others. Let's

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.750
begin visually. This is a sculpture of a keyboard, where every letter has been raised to a height

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.670
that corresponds to its popularity compared
to the other letters. The letter "E" is the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.019
most common letter typed in almost 
every language that has a letter "E."

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.409
But to figure out letter frequencies in texts
that you type yourself, use Patrick Wied's

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:07.889
heat map. On this site you can type a sentence
in and see how frequently the characters are

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:12.169
used. For instance, this sentence contains
every letter in the alphabet at least once,

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:15.369
but it uses "E" and "O" the most.

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:21.819
Roughly speaking, and considering different
languages, of all the characters typed, or

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:29.299
tapped on a phone everyday, about 9% of them
are the letter "E," which is a lot, but the

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:36.360
letter "E" is not the most common key. The
space bar is the most commonly pressed key -

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.620
nearly twice as popular as the letter "E."

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.319
Now that we know about the space bar's popularity,
let's return to texting and add in keyboard

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:54.810
typing. If we assume that about 350 million
people are typing 5-10,000 characters a day

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.420
on keyboards, and add that to the number of
characters being texted everyday, we can do

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.680
a little bit of math and determine that at
any given second, here, on Earth, the space

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.600
bar is being pressed 6 million times.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.540
6 million spaces bar a second! What a great
world, right? Well, let's think of it this

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:24.160
way. Because it only takes 1/10th of a second
to tap, or type, a space bar, when you push

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:31.520
the space bar, statistically speaking, as
many as 600,000 other people on Earth did

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.240
that at the exact same time that you did.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.620
So, if you ever feel alone, just give yourself
some space and know that more than half a

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.520
million people are doing that exact same thing.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.120
And as always,

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.180
thanks for watching.
