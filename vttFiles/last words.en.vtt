00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:03.669
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.440
On December 17th, 1977,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.880
Gary Gilmore was executed for murder.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.150
He was the first prisoner executed
by the United States after a

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.970
10-year suspension of the practice.
When asked if he had any

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.070
last words, he simply replied
"let's do it."

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.700
Years later, advertising executive Dan Wieden
adapted those words into

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.930
a slogan, that is now more widely known

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.450
than Gary Gilmore.
Last words

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.690
are powerful.
They are the final statement, a person's entire life has

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.890
been leading up to.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.620
One last chance to go on record
before obliteration.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.219
We don't know Albert Einstein's

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.260
last words.
He spoke them in German

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.629
to a nurse who only knew English,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.480
They're lost.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.379
But what will be

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.040
our first words?
The first words

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.600
from earth extraterrestrials out there
might hear from us.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.130
We have been broadcasting signals
with radio waves

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.820
wirelessly through the air for more than
one hundred years.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.990
Under the right conditions,
those signals can leak into space

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.549
and keep going outward at the speed of light

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.509
through our galaxy, through the universe.
Current human technology would struggle

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.490
to tune into regular TV and radio broadcasts from

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.049
as near as Mars.
But perhaps other intelligent beings out there

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.540
would fare better and could point there
instruments at earth

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.990
and hear us.
If so, what would the

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.750
earliest thing be that they could receive?

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.759
Our cosmic first

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.820
words.
Well, the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.329
earliest signal, robust enough to be
picked up light years away,

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.350
might have come from Hitler.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.430
His 1936 broadcasting

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.129
of the Summer Olympics used powerful
enough radio equipment to reach

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.770
forty-one countries,

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.720
making it a contender for what listening
extraterrestrials could receive as,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.910
to them, Earth's first words.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.620
Within the last 50 years or so, broadcast signals

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.739
in general, have become stronger
than Hitler's Olympics

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.400
and are better candidates for being intercepted.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.540
The earliest of them have traveled
50 light years away from Earth.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.720
Altogether they have entertained billions of

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.360
people and by now about 2,000 stars.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.970
The 133 brightest of which are shown

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.250
here.
So far, Martin Luther King JR's

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.010
"I have a dream" speech
has traveled as far as the furthest

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.019
on the diagram µAra, which has

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.410
four known planets.
In six years,

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.200
our first words on the Moon
will pass by µAra's

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.030
system.
"That's one small step for man,

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.640
one giant leap for mankind."
Those words were spoken by Neil

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.220
Armstrong,
seen here a few years before his death

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.120
with Eugene Cernan,
the most recent and currently

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.920
last man to have walked on the surface of the Moon.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.299
On December 14th, 1972,

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.970
before climbing back into the lunar module,
Cernan spoke

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.810
our, as of today, last words on the Moon.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.640
"We leave as we came and,

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.819
God willing, as we shall return, with peace,

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.569
and hope for all mankind."
Of course,

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.709
once inside the lunar module, the crew kept

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.670
talking, meaning that technically
the very last words humans have said

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.099
on the surface of the Moon were a
countdown spoken by Harrison

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.839
Jack Schmitt.
"Three, two, one."

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.180
We haven't been back to the Moon

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.810
since.
But hold on. What were the first words

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.879
spoken on the surface of the Moon

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.879
really?
Armstrong's giant

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.350
leap statement is a good answer,
but what counts as being

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.790
on the Moon if touchdown

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.820
counts? Then the first words spoken on the
Moon go not to Armstrong but to Buzz Aldrin,

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.560
who, on feeling at least one of the landing pads

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.160
softly settle onto the lunar soil, spoke

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.620
this immortal description:
"contact light."

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.680
We are pumping broadcasts in the space

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.590
as an ever expanding sphere of radio waves.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.220
But here's something humbling.
Even while growing at the speed of light,

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.550
Earth's radio sphere is puny.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.430
This is our galaxy, the Milky Way.
Comparatively,

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.580
the distance our radio signals, our voice

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.660
has traveled is this big.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.820
The universe is huge.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.270
How the heck are you supposed
to be remembered in it?

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.950
Utter last words that stick around after you die?

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.550
Well, you may have heard
the famous quote from Banksy

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.610
"They say you die twice.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.260
One time when you stop breathing and a second time,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.740
a bit later on, when somebody says your name

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.170
for the last time."
But your anonymous influence continues

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.460
long after that, right?
I mean, people may stop saying your name,

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.460
but, for instance, if you have kids and they have kids

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.680
and so on and so on, you continue on,

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.400
in a way.
Maybe just genetically, not by name.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.360
Well, people have tried.
The world record

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.200
for most children passed
out of one single woman

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.840
belongs to Mrs. Feodor Vassilyev.
She had

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.030
16 pairs of twins, 7 sets of triplets

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.170
and 4 sets of quadruplets for a grand total

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:21.500
of 69 children.
As for being a biological

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.320
father, that takes less time.
The documented record

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.960
for most children fathered by one man is held

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.820
by Ismail Ibn Sharif, who is estimated to have had

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.830
more than 900 children with multiple women.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.720
But children—or not—in a feedback system like

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.200
earth or life, cause-and-effect

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.480
are complicated and never ending.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.460
Remember the double pendulums
from this video? A small difference

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.130
in the initial conditions of a system
can lead to enormously 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.950
different outcomes later.
On Tuesday

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.570
I'm flying from London to Los Angeles.
The plane will be flown by pilots who

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.460
can steer it toward the correct runway

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.110
in the United States, but if the airplane needed to be

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.100
aimed from London and sent on a straight shot,

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.250
now, things would need to be very specific.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.050
Misaiming just one degree to the left

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.460
at the beginning would send
the plane not to Los Angeles

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.970
but nearly 160 kilometres south
to Tijuana, Mexico.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:33.320
Your name and your last words might
eventually be forgotten, but your status

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.770
as an initial condition for the universe's

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.410
future is already happening.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.760
Bach died before he could complete

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.680
The Art of Fugue.
The peace ends abruptly

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:51.740
during Contrapunctus XIV.
So, composers continue

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.620
reconstructing it.
For that reason, it is

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.190
uniquely alive.
Speaking new

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.230
last words all the time,
as new people meet it

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.890
and finish it in their own way.
Likewise, no matter how

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.890
cool or lame and small

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:14.460
you feel, you will continue.
Your impact will be remembered, mathematics

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:18.190
guarantees it.
Even if like Bach you leave things

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:19.470
unfinished.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.300
And as always,

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:21.800
thanks for wa...
