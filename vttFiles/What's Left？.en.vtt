00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.880
Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.400
And today, we're going to talk about this.
Just kidding.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.920
We're going to talk about this.
Left.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.820
What's left?
First of all, 90% of humans, regardless of

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.540
culture or language are right-handed.
And we choose a dominant hand before we've

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.760
even left our mothers.
That's right.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.540
When a baby inside its mother's womb is seen
sucking its thumb, it is sucking the right

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.310
thumb 90% of the time.
Animals do it too.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:40.470
In fact, horses take longer strides with their
right legs, which is the entire reason racetracks

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.800
are run counterclockwise.
Left-handedness is so rare that across most

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.240
cultures there has been a historical stigma
against being left-handed.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.380
In fact, the word for somehow who's good at
using both hands is ambidextrous and "dexter"

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.739
comes from Latin for "right."
So when you call somebody ambidextrous, you're

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.140
not saying that they're good with using both
hands, you're telling them that they have

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.880
two right hands.
And if someone is unable to use either hand,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.840
they're called ambisinister, because in Latin
"sinister" means "left."

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.060
But why do we have to have a dominant hand
in the first place?

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.000
Why can't we all just be awesome with both
hands?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.600
Well the fault lies in the brain.
Now, brain wants to be efficient, so it divvies

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.340
up tasks to specific regions and it tends
to avoid sending too much information between

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.250
both hemispheres, because doing so would require
using the corpus callosum, which would take

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.790
more time and energy.
Now, the way the brain works is kind of funny.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.050
The left side of the brain controls the right
side of the body and the right side of the

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.020
brain controls the left side of the body.
So it makes sense that the hand you're best

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.369
doing precise stuff with would correlate to
the hemisphere of the brain that does the

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.310
most precise processing.
In 95% of right-handed people it's the left

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.010
hemisphere that deals with precise language
thinking, like definitions.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.580
But when you're left-handed, there's about
a 40% chance that you're using the right hemisphere

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.420
or both.
And this is where things get interesting.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.540
Now being left-handed or ambidextrous does
not mean that your brain works in one way

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.819
or the other.
But it may help explain why across averages

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.390
ambidextrous people sometimes score lower
on IQ tests, or why a greater proportion of

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.210
schizophrenics are left-handed or ambidextrous
than the rest of the population.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.340
Now that said, there are giant benefits to
having a brain like that.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.590
By sending information back and forth, more
novel connections are made, more creative

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.890
ideas are made.
Albert Einstein was left-handed.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.690
And 5 of the last 7 US presidents have been
left-handed.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.030
There's something else left-handed people
have an advantage with - keyboards.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.380
On a QWERTY keyboard, thousands and thousands
of English words can be typed using the left

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.790
hand.
But on the right side of the keyboard you

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.959
can only write maybe about a 100 or so.
On the left side of a keyboard the left hand

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.819
all on its own can type pretty long somewhat
common words, like stewardesses, reverberated

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.819
and desegregated.
But on the right-hand side the longest common

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.179
word you can type is "lollipop."
Oh look, a spacebar.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.940
When people go to space, they have left Earth.
The first person to leave Earth into space

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.959
was Yuri Gagarin, a Soviet cosmonaut.
But the one I'm interested in was the fourth

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.179
man into space, Gherman Titov.
He may have only been the fourth person into

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:45.500
space, but he was the first person to have
left Earth and simultaneously left wakefulness.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.610
Titov was the first person to sleep in space.
And here's what's really fun.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.140
He was 25 years old when he did it, which
means that to this day Titov is the youngest

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.870
human who has ever been to space.
You know what else leaves Earth?

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.530
Helium.
That's right.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.540
Helium gas that we use in balloons is lighter
than air and so molecules of helium rise all

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.209
the way to the very tip top of our atmosphere,
where they get picked off by solar wind, meaning

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.339
that they leave us forever.
In fact, there's a little bit of a concern

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:22.679
over how much helium we have left, because
the only way helium comes into existence on

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.260
Earth is through radioactive decay.
Alpha particles are essentially helium nuclei

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.290
and we find a lot of helium inside natural
gas.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.510
But right now we're using a lot of it and
helium is quite cheap, so there's a realistic

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:42.710
concern that within the next 30 or 40 years
we may have no helium left.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.220
Thanks for watching.
