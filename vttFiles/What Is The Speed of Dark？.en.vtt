00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.240
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.780
Nyctophobia is the fear of the dark.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.040
But there's another fear that's more chilling.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.180
It's the fear that darkness will go away.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.690
Optophobia, the fear of opening your eyes.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.270
Light travels at the fastest speed possible for
a physical object.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.360
Darkness is erased when light appears, and returns

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.420
when light leaves. The speed of dark

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.770
is the speed of light but there are
other types of darkness

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.580
that can move faster than light speed. For
instance,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.680
a shadow.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.260
Across a distance, a shadow can become
much larger than the object creating it,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.570
but still mimic its source, moving in the
same way for the same amount of time.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.190
So when a shadow is bigger than the object casting it, it moves a greater distance

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.460
when the object moves but in the same amount of time. Make a shadow large enough

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.860
and it can travel across the surface faster than light.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.390
If you, here on Earth, cast a shadow onto
the Moon,

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.070
not an easy thing to do, that pointed
from, say, point A

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.380
on the moon's surface, and then you moved
your finger so that the shadow moved

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.070
to point B, your finger would only move a
few centimetres

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.369
in a fraction of a second. But the
shadow it cast on the Moon

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.070
would move thousands of kilometers in
the same amount of time.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.149
Do it right and you're easily producing a shadow

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.009
that breaks the light barrier.

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.660
But nothing's wrong here.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.670
The rule is that information can't
travel faster than light.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.720
You can't cause something to happen
somewhere else

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.460
faster than light could travel from you
to that somewhere else.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.700
And our superluminal shadow is transferring

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.360
no information from point A to point B.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.360
Sure, point B is being cast into
darkness

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.220
sooner than a light speed message from A could warn him it's coming

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.750
but darkness isn't traveling from
point A to point B.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.110
It's traveling from you to point A and point B

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.200
at the speed of light. What we tend to call a shadow

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.260
is really just a cross-section of a three-dimensional region.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.020
The darkness you are causing only changes shape

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.900
when newly unblocked light fills

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.280
the previous gap. That's all shadow is:

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.709
a gap. So, in a way, a shadow doesn't

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.500
travel at all. That's an illusion caused by us thinking

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.830
that a shadow is a physical thing, when in reality

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.310
a shadow is just the lack of physical things -

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.980
photons - which chug along at speed limit

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.550
of the universe. But that doesn't mean two shadows

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.970
can't kiss. Or, at least,

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.650
look like they are. Watch as Guy brings two shadows

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.810
near each other. Right before they actually make contact,

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.230
the shadows seem to magically bulge toward one another,

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.300
in a sort of smooch of darkness. What's going on is the

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.360
shadows blister effect and it has to do with
the anatomy of a shadow.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.160
The region where an object completely blocks a light source is called

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.680
the umbra. It's the darkest part of the
shadow in the most prototypical

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.540
part of the shadow. Where only a portion of the light source is

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.319
blocked, we find the fainter penumbra. But as two or more penumbras

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.430
approach and overlap, the combined amount of light they block can be enough to

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.360
produce a perceivable difference,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.940
the shadow blister. The Earth has a big

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.220
umbra, it's 1.4 million kilometres long.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.030
That's how far away you'd have to be from
the Earth for it to no longer have a

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.540
large enough apparent diameter

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.860
to block out all of the sun. Here, on the
surface of Earth, we are nowhere near that

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.430
far away, which is why night is so umbral.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.260
Night is just the Earth's shadow falling on you.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.440
A you eclipse.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.800
Sunsets are cool, they're beautiful to look at, but look
the other way

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.250
and you can see the lumbering shadow of our planet.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.140
Our atmosphere scatters shorter
wavelengths of light

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.389
more than longer wavelengths, which makes the sky

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.310
appear blue. But in Earth's shadow there's
less light to scatter and the sky

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.940
appears darker. During twilight you can see

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.889
the demarcation. While driving east from
Denver to Kansas City

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.769
I got a particularly great view of it.

00:04:31.769 --> 00:04:35.560
This is Earth's approaching night-making shadow.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.160
The beautiful pink band above it? 
That's the belt of Venus.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.780
It's caused by the sky reflecting the the colours

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.500
of the sunset behind us. You've probably noticed that

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.699
right after the sun sets, and disappears from view,

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.430
there's still light in the sky, scattered from the

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.039
no longer visible sun. This is what we call twilight

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.590
and there are many different stages of
twilight.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.629
If the sun is less than six degrees
below the horizon it's technically

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:10.380
civil twilight. You can still do plenty of stuff outdoors without the need for artificial lights.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.419
Down to 12 degrees below the horizon we have

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.210
nautical twilight: artificial lights are
more or less necessary but the sky

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.499
still scatters enough light to be bright enough for ships at sea

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:25.770
to navigate by seeing a contrast of the horizon between dark sea

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.909
and faintly lit sky. Down to 18 degrees

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:33.499
an astronomical twilight is occurring. It looks like

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:36.699
night but the sky can still get darker. Until

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:41.659
astronomical twilight ends not all night time astronomical observations can be made.

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:44.860
Below 18 degrees is technically,

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:52.000
honestly, night. If you live at greater than
48.5 degrees north or south latitude,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.100
during the summer the sun never goes more than 18 degrees below the horizon.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:03.400
It's never technically night. Places like
London only reach astronomical twilight at the most

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.349
during these months.
So, if you live in one of these areas,

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:11.539
and you want to avoid doing something during
the summer, just tell people

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:15.150
you'll do it tonight. You'll buy yourself
a few weeks.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.150
But that's slow darkness. Let's

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.539
cut to the chase because we are looking
for fast darkness.

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:28.020
When scissor blades snip, the intersection
point between both blades moves faster

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.279
than the blades themselves.
Think of it this way:

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:35.360
if you had a pair of scissors with
blades that were a light year long

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.580
and it took one second to close them, the
intersection point would've traveled an entire

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.749
light year, in not a year but...

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:48.930
a second. No laws are being broken here
because such a snip

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.300
would be physically impossible. 
As I've mentioned before,

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.110
rigid objects don't move instantaneously all over

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.970
when a push force is applied to them.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.699
Instead, that force moves via electromagnetic
forces, from one atom

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:07.439
to the next, and so on down the line.
A compression wave

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:10.999
that travels at the speed of sound
through the material.

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:15.599
But what if we ignored that problem by
allowing the blades to simply be separately

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:19.270
already in motion? Well, their point at
intersection

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.760
can still travel faster than light,
because it's not a physical thing.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.900
It's just a geometric point and it carries

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.319
no more information than you could already gather

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:33.099
by witnessing the approaching blades.

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:37.180
But don't count out that geometric point of
intersection just yet. It's the key to

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.680
another type of darkness that can move faster than light.

00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:46.439
When waves collide their crests can fuse into larger crests,

00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:51.569
their troughs into larger troughs. This is
constructive interference.

00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:54.710
But crests colliding with troughs cancel
out.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:58.159
Destructive interference if these waves
are light,

00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:02.139
the result is darkness. And, in certain
circumstances,

00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:06.629
darkness created this way can travel like the intersection between two lines -

00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:11.840
faster than light. Imagine these concentric
circles as waves of light.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.740
The lines are wave crests and the
gaps in between

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.699
are troughs. When they meet the points
where they intersect

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:22.039
flee up and down faster than the waves
travel,

00:08:22.039 --> 00:08:25.699
especially in the middle, which, in the
case of light waves, makes them

00:08:25.699 --> 00:08:31.559
faster than light. The superluminal
speeds of these dark patches can be seen really clearly

00:08:31.559 --> 00:08:34.570
if we make the wave crests of one source black

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.700
as well as the background. Overlapping
regions where red

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.510
peeks through represent destructive
interference -

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:45.000
darkness. And you can see how, especially
in the middle,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.500
this darkness races up and down faster
than the waves.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.180
In 1995 a man named McArthur Wheeler

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.779
robbed a bank in Pittsburgh. He was caught

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:01.110
because his only disguise was lemon juice.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:06.230
He covered his face with it. He knew that lemon juice could be used as an invisible ink

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:11.290
when writing on paper, revealed by heating, and he knew so little about

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:15.209
why that worked and he knew so little about how cameras worked

00:09:15.209 --> 00:09:18.540
that he assumed, with extreme confidence, that lemon juice

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.480
could make him invisible too.

00:09:23.569 --> 00:09:27.990
Seriously. Wheeler is an extreme example

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:32.080
and was the inspiration for the Dunning-Kruger effect

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.800
Novices, people unskilled in particular disciplines

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.440
will often overestimate their knowledge and abilities

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.940
in said disciplines because they don't even know

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.800
how little they know, how much more there is to learn.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.040
On the flip side, experts in particular field will often

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.110
underestimate their knowledge, have less
confidence in their abilities,

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:58.130
or think that everyone else has the
same level of knowledge that they do.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.980
What drives the Dunning-Kruger effect

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.200
is the fact that often the more you
learn about something the more you realise

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:12.200
just how rich and complex and overwhelming and full of as of yet unanswered questions it really is.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.360
George Bernard Shaw once famously toasted Albert Einstein by saying

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.459
"Science is always wrong.

00:10:19.459 --> 00:10:23.269
It never solves a problem without creating ten more."

00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:26.620
Einstein didn't exactly disagree. He used

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.529
geometry to illustrate how ignorance grows
faster than knowledge, saying

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:35.380
"as our circle of knowledge expands so does
the circumference

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.600
of darkness surrounding it. Learning

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.899
studying, shedding light on a field of
inquiry also reveals just how

00:10:42.899 --> 00:10:48.000
in the dark we continue to be. How many
shadowy things there are left

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.190
for us to illuminate. The diameter of
light

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:54.370
never exceeds the shadowy circumference."

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:57.670
But what's the speed of that kind dark?
The speed of the growth

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:02.120
of the number of things we know we are in the dark about.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.460
What's the speed of ignorance?

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:08.670
If we define ignorance as the difference
between questions we know to ask,

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:12.079
and answers we have, the field of agnotology,

00:11:12.089 --> 00:11:15.110
the study of ignorance, suggests that the amount of

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:19.490
things we know we are in the dark about is growing faster

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.629
than the amount the things we have shed light on.

00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:27.520
Is it a coincidence that the phrase "in
the dark" originated during of all ages

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.720
the age of enlightenment? 
When Leeuwenhoek put a scraping

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.600
from his tooth under a collection of
magnifying lenses he built,

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.060
he saw, for the first time in human history,

00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:43.269
little moving creatures... microorganisms.

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:47.889
He called them 'Animalcules'. 
The discovery shed light on why

00:11:47.889 --> 00:11:51.420
food spoiled life didn't spontaneously come
from old meat,

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.160
it was already there, we just couldn't see it.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.410
But the discovery also showed us that we
were in the dark

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:00.610
about an entirely new realm of biology.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:05.960
As Philippe Bourdeau has poetically put it,
"enlightenment leads to benightedness

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.660
science entails nescience".

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:14.020
What's really cool about
the expanding size of our nescience circumference

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:20.500
is what Stuart Firestein, the Chair of Biological Sciences at Columbia University, has said about it,

00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:24.670
"it is there that science begins,

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:28.500
where the facts run out, just beyond them."

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.840
He says, "it is a mistake to bob around
in the circle of facts,

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.260
instead of riding the wave to the
great expanse

00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:38.889
lying outside the circle."

00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:43.829
If science is a road trip, facts are the photos

00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:47.699
we take along the way, the fuel that drives it forward

00:12:47.699 --> 00:12:51.399
is ignorance. Facts... more like

00:12:51.399 --> 00:12:54.959
fax. Part of the past, not the way forward.

00:12:54.959 --> 00:12:57.619
When it comes to understanding our world,

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:01.900
knowing why is obsolesce by asking why.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:05.060
Knowing facts makes you bright, but the

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:09.100
equally quick, sometimes quicker, and most rewarding prize

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.920
is the dark.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:15.980
And admitting that you don't know everything but that you would like to know some of it.

00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:17.180
And as always,

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:18.860
thanks for watching.
