00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.520
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
Let's take a moment to recognize

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.849
the heroes who count.
Canadian

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.769
Mike Smith holds the world record for
the largest number

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.730
counted to in one breath - 125.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.039
But the world record for the largest number

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.109
ever counted to belongs to Jeremy Harper

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.580
from Birmingham, Alabama.
In order to set the record,

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.500
Harper never left his apartment.
He got regular sleep,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.579
but from the moment he woke up in the
morning until the moment he went to bed

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:35.280
at night,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.079
Harper did nothing but count.
He streamed the entire process

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.329
over the Internet and raised money for
charity while doing it,

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.550
but after three months of counting

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.840
all day, every day, he finally reached the world record -

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.870
1 million.
Now, a million might not sound

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.760
like a lot, but think of this way.
One thousand

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.030
seconds is about 17 minutes,

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.650
but a million seconds is more than 11

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.100
days.
And a billion seconds, well,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.299
that's more than 31 years.
There's no full video online of Harper counting all

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.400
the way to a million,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.350
but you can watch John Harchick count
all the way to 100,000, if you have

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.299
74 hours to spare.

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.680
John also has some other channels.
One involves more than 300 videos

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.009
of himself eating carrots.
Another, more than 3,000 videos of himself

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.500
drinking water.
Many of John's videos

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.140
literally have no views.
They are as lonely as a video on YouTube can get.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.450
A great way to find such videos is a website made

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.530
by Jon van der Kruisen.
This website auto plays videos on YouTube that no one

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.880
has yet watched.
John and Jeremy,

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.060
as well as Mike, the one breath counter
counted like this.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.280
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and so on.
But that's not the only way to count.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.259
And it doesn't seem to be the one we're
born with. Additive counting is the one

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.420
we're all familiar with,

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.860
where each next step is just one added

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.950
to the last.
But what if we multiply it by a number instead?

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.420
Well, that kind of counting is logarithmic, from

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.370
"arithmos" meaning number and "logos" meaning ratio,

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.690
proportion.
On this scale, similar distances

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.560
are similar proportions.
One is a third of three

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.769
and three is a third of nine.
Four is a third of 12 and so on.

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.090
Our brains perceive the world around us
on a logarithmic scale.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.680
It's believed that almost all of our
senses are multiplicative,

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.590
not additive.
For example, how loud we perceive a sound to be.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.910
Two boomboxes playing at the same volume
don't sound

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.320
twice as loud as one.
In order to make a sound that is perceived as being

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.680
about twice as loud as one boombox,
you actually need

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.290
ten times as many, so 10.
And to double that loudness,

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.350
you would need a hundred.
And to double that loudness,

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.870
you would need a thousand.
Having an intuitive sense

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.660
of logarithmic scales built into your brain
is probably an advantage when it comes

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.989
to natural selection

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.190
and survival, because often proportion

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.890
matters more than absolute value.
For example,

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.010
"is there one lion hiding over there in the shadows

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.290
or two?" is a very different question

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.290
than "are there ninety six lions about to attack us

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.680
or ninety seven?"
Sure, in both cases I'm just talking about one extra lion,

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.800
but adding one lion to one lion, doubles the threat.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.400
Adding one lion to 96, well, that's basically nothing.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.000
Logarithmic thinking and feeling may
explain why life

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
seems to speed-up as we get older.
It seems like I was a child

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.910
for ever.
And in college, in my early 20's, just whizzed by.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.989
And logarithmically, that makes sense,
because each new year that I live

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.940
is the smaller fraction of all the other
years I've already lived.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.950
When you turn 2 years old, the last year of your life is

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.040
half your life.
But when you turn 81, that last year that you've lived,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.510
well, that's just a tiny part of the
other 80 that you know.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.120
Logarithmic thinking isn't always helpful,

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.340
especially in scenarios where proportion
doesn't logically matter

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.390
but we, nonetheless, act like it does.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.660
One of my favorite examples is
the psychophysics of price

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.820
paradox.
This is something almost all of us do.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.450
Researchers found consistently that
people are willing to put a lot of

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.360
effort into saving

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.270
5 dollars of a 10 dollar purchase,
but they won't put much effort into

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.610
saving 5 five dollars

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.100
of a 2,000 dollar purchase.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.760
It's 5 dollars saved either way,
but our natural obsession with proportion

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.270
leads us astray.
Take a look at these pictures.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:07.770
Can you tell how many objects are in each of them?
You probably can.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.720
It's like really easy.
You can tell if there are

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.830
zero, one, two, three or four objects in a photo

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.570
without even needing to count.
How are you doing that?

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.850
Is it some sort of sixth sense?
No.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.510
Psychologists call it "subitizing."
We can, intuitively,

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.720
at a glance, determine whether there are
about four or fewer objects in a photo.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.490
This has been part of human culture
for a very long time

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.310
and it may be the reason so many tally
systems from all over the world all

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.130
through history

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.080
wind up having to do something different
when counting the number five.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.860
When estimating or comparing amounts above 4,

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.560
the brain uses what's known as an
approximate number system.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.539
It's a psychological ability we have.
It's about 15 percent

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.720
accurate. It two amounts are at least 15
percent different, we can tell.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.280
So, for example, 100 objects and 115

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.610
or a thousand and 1,150 or 1,200.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.510
If you wanna test the accuracy of your
approximate number system

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.560
Panamath has a pretty good test.
We often take

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.330
linear additive counting for granted,
but it's not granted to us.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.330
We aren't born with it.
We are, however, born with the ability to subitize

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.450
and use an approximate number system.
Children younger than the age of three

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.289
can tell, without counting, that this line of 4 coins

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:32.720
contains fewer coins than this line of 6, even

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.190
if you spread the 4 coins out into a
line that is physically bigger,

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.170
longer than this line of 6.
However, mysteriously,

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.920
around the age of 3.5, children lose this ability

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.930
and begin saying that this line of 6 coins

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.440
contains fewer coins than this long line

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.880
of just 4 coins, possibly because around this age

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.540
the physical world of objects,
physical sizes, is more salient in their minds.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.710
But then, when they begin to learn linear counting,

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.030
they reverse back and begin again
correctly saying that this line of 6

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.850
contains more coins than this line of 4,

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.460
around the age of 4.
The smallest

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.130
physical thing science could ever hope
to observe is the Planck length.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.360
In order to look at anything smaller,
you'd need to have so much

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.480
energy concentrated in such a small area
a black hole would form and you would lose

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.700
whatever you were looking at.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.660
Okay, with that in mind, here's a question.
What number

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.490
is halfway in-between 1 and 9.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.460
5 seems like the obvious answer.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.150
There are four numbers on either side of 5,
it's halfway between,

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.770
right?
Well, if you ask this question of a young child

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:50.169
or a member of a culture that doesn't
teach a linear additive number line,

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:54.080
their answer will be 3.
You see,

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.200
they are exhibiting the human mind's
natural logarithmic tendency,

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.250
because 3 in that sense makes sense.
Three

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:05.930
is three times larger than 1,
and 9 is three times larger than 3.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:11.000
Three is in the middle, proportionately.
But what if we took that logarithmic number

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:11.669
line

00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:15.370
and change the one to be
the smallest thing we can observe,

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:19.380
the Planck length, and the nine to be the
largest thing we can observe,

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.650
the observable universe.
What would go

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:27.889
in the middle?
Well, as it turns out, we would.

00:08:27.889 --> 00:08:31.320
The number of Planck lengths you could
stretch across a brain cell

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.839
is equal to the number of your brain
cells it would take to stretch

00:08:34.839 --> 00:08:37.899
all the way across the observable universe. sold

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:39.479
So,

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:41.039
welcome to the middle.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.539
And as always,

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.360
thanks for watching.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.700
Hello again.

00:08:55.709 --> 00:08:59.930
The YouTube channel Field Day recently
gave me an opportunity to explore

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.610
Whittier, Alaska, one of the strangest places

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:07.250
humans call home.
To see why and to see me investigate,

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:10.639
talk to the locals, click the link in
this video's description or on the

00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:12.269
annotation here on this video.

00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:15.769
It was really fun, so give it a little

00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:16.279
lookie look.
