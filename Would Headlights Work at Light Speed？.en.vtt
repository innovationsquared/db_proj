00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.680
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. If you were driving in a car

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.380
at the speed of light and you turned on your headlights

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.400
what would happen? Would light be able to come out

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.809
or would your headlights just stay dark?

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.140
Or maybe, light would come out but it just pull up

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.539
inside the headlight like a overflowing sink.

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.560
Or maybe the light would come out but at
twice the speed of light - at its normal

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.660
speed plus the speed of your car.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.200
No, that doesn't sound right. None of these
answers sound right because,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.649
of course, there is no answer.

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.940
A car cannot travel at the speed

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.180
of light. Nothing that has mass can.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.340
But come on, you say, there are things
that can travel at the speed of light.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.410
Things that have no mass, like photons. Let's build a car

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.539
out of light. Okay.

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.109
Let's take that suggestion because imagining what it is like

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.000
to be light, brings up a lot of questions about

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.360
light, about why things are the way they are

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.510
and about whether or not we are real.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.950
In order to see what I mean we need to
talk about "C".

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.820
The speed of light.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.870
It is Constant. As long as you aren't
accelarating, you can move as fast or

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:24.600
slow or

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.760
in whatever direction you want and you will still

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.900
always see light moving at light

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.500
speed. Even when light appears to slow
down, as it passes through different

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.430
materials,

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.730
the actual photons themselves are still
always traveling at "C".

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.000
They're just taking a longer path, which takes

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.030
more time. This law always holds true
because whenever you move,

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.090
relative to other things, your
measurements of them and their

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.270
measurements of you

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.530
change. When you move, everything not
moving with you appears to you to be

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.200
shortened

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.860
in length and to be experiencing time more slowly.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.790
Whereas to everything else, it is you
that these changes happen to.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.070
These changes really happen - just not
noticeably or measurably at the speeds

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.600
we usually travel at.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.930
For example, while walking to your
refrigerator for a snack,

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.670
you will measure your fridge to be a 100 quadrillionth

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.470
of a meter nearer and thinner than you
would while at rest with it.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.740
You'll also notice that it experiences time more slowly

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.380
than you. Each one of its seconds
will be a 100 quadrillionth

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.489
of a second longer than yours. But your fridge

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.810
will measure that these transformations are
happening to you.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.530
These are small numbers, but at speeds
nearer the speed of light

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.660
these changes can be dramatic. As I
mentioned in an earlier video,

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:54.160
to a particle racing toward Earth at
99.9999999999991%

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.560
the entire Earth would only appear to be

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.650
70 meters deep. Our whole planet.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.709
Now with all of this in mind, let's take a
look at headlights

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.239
being used by a stationary ship and one that is moving

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.490
at 99 percent the speed of light.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.750
The Near Light Speed Ship would be
flattened in the direction of its travel

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.470
to us,

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.430
while a stationary one would not. As their
headlights come on

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.020
the light coming from both ships travels
at the same rate.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.280
The speed of a lights' source doesn't
push it faster.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.690
The moving ships velocity does, however,
give its headlight energy

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.180
in the direction it's headed, causing a
blue shift from the front and a red shift

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.110
from behind.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.330
What's really cool though is that this
is just what

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.160
we would see, floating in space at rest
with the stationary ship.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.569
The crew of the fast-moving ship
wouldn't see their beams, only gradually

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:44.390
gaining on them

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.080
like we do, they would see it exactly
what the crew the stationary ships sees.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.819
Light beams rapidly fleeing their
headlights at the speed of light

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.390
just as if they were moving at all. And
here's why. Let's say this distance

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.810
is a light second. The distance light
travels in one second. Which is

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.720
299,792,458 meters.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.480
Now, after one of our seconds, sure enough,

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.170
both beams will have traveled a light
second. But the crew of the moving ship

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.390
measures light speed to be the same as us.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.380
But how does that make sense?
I mean, light hasn't traveled a light second from

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.410
them yet. No problem. You see, what they
measure a light second to be

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.410
is shorter than what we measure. And

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.780
they wouldn't agree that a second has
passed yet either. Because, of course, to

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.240
us

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.860
time is slower for them. They count one
second finishing later then we do,

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.750
at which point their light has, indeed,
traveled one of their light seconds

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.050
from them. Observers will often disagree

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.680
about time and space, but those
disagreements with always conspire

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.680
to make sure they agree on one thing.
The speed of light.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.430
It is always the same for everyone.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.680
But what if you were travelling

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.960
at the speed of light? Well, the only
thing that could do that would be a

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.940
massless vehicle. So, fine, let's assume
that we can build one.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.130
Such a vehicle would travel with

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.610
light. Light would never even pull

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.810
a tiny tiny bit ahead of it. No matter how short

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.169
it thought a meter was. No matter how long
it thought a second was.

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.720
It would never register light ever moving ahead of it.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.050
It would say that light was stationary.
It would not agree that light travelled

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.940
at the speed of light. Right? Not really.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.680
You see, at the speed of light there is nothing

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.580
to see. Not because there's nothing to
see but because there is nothing

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.840
to do any seeing.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.550
As we have seen, as an object's velocity approaches

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.190
"C", time for everything around it approaches

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.370
a standstill. An object

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.419
traveling very very very very very very
near the speed of light

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:05.810
could travel for billions of our years

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.970
before a single second past for it.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.130
But a massless vehicle, travelling at the speed of light,

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.259
could travel forever

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:19.419
before an instant even began for it.

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:22.689
It experiences no time.

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:25.999
And it would have no time to do anything.

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:29.150
Certainly no time to turn on its

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.229
headlights. The concept of time doesn't even really

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:36.629
apply. A massless vehicle couldn't even
have its headlights on

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:40.620
before it hits "C", because object with no
mass

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.080
must always travel at "C". Such an object

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.789
would never have a before. Its origin,

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:53.180
its journey and its destination are simultaneous for it.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.340
A billion light year trip from a distant quasar

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.509
might take a photon a billion years

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:02.599
to us. But it literally takes no time

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:07.250
for the photon. And to the photon, the
distance to us from that quasar

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.360
is literally nothing. Photons

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.080
are how we see. How we know anything
about our place in the universe,

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.379
and the energy they bring our planet from the Sun is responsible for nearly

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:24.550
all life on Earth. But despite that list
of accomplishments,

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.150
they don't think much of themselves.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.200
In fact, as far as they're concerned, they

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.610
don't even exist. Outside observers, of course,

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.090
see them and would measure them to be
moving along at the speed of light

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.180
with nothing passing or gaining on them.
So if you were moving

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.440
at the speed of light, you'd have to be massless,

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.710
like a photon,

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.570
and you wouldn't notice anything, because to
you there would be nothing,

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:54.260
and no time to notice it. Other people
would see you doing nothing

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.630
and you would be unaware of yourself. You
could never turn on headlights

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:03.480
because you would feel exactly like you
felt before you were conceived.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.400
But why is the speed of light what it is?

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.010
I mean, this is how far light travels

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:15.120
in a second. Could it also travel

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.910
this far, or this far, or this far?
Could we conceive of a universe where light

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:20.500
traveled

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.710
that quickly? Yeah, easily.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.310
So then, why is it that the universe we live in

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:32.700
is only one of these ways? Why are the laws

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.850
of physics what they are? Instead of

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.930
some other way they could be.

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:43.610
Well, there are a lot of theories, but so
far we're not exactly sure how to

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.940
test any of them, because we are stuck in this

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.970
universe and don't yet know how to
create universes of our own

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:55.270
for experiments. But perhaps there is
something we have yet to discover that

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:56.200
compels

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.000
reality to be this way, and only this way. 

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.100
Or, perhaps, nothing compels it to be this
way but instead

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.560
there's a multiverse. Every single possible universe

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.770
exists. Some of them collapsed
immediately, some of them are empty and dark,

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:15.450
some of them involve you watching this very video but

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.790
Earth has two Suns.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:21.480
For those of you, in that universe
watching, that was probably very confusing

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.100
what I just say

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.690
because your Earth does have two Suns.
But the point is, the multiverse

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:29.580
would be a pretty elegant explanation. 
Or maybe,

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.400
universes are born inside black holes.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.880
Universes whose physical laws are only
slightly different from the universe

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.170
that gave birth to it.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:42.970
In this way, universes could replicate
according to natural selection.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:46.570
Universes that are more fit for creating black holes

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.690
would then have more baby universes,

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.710
making universes that support black
holes more common,

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:57.010
like maybe the one that we're in. And that's
pretty lucky because universes that

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.230
support black holes

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.589
support Suns, and us.

00:10:01.589 --> 00:10:05.140
Or - and here's my favorite theory -

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.470
maybe we're just living in a simulation.
And someone or something else

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:10.910
programmed it up.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.700
That sounds pretty sci-fi.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.950
Sure. But I like how Julian Baggini puts it in

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.790
"The Pig That Wants to Be Eaten".
If you assume, that at some point in time,

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:25.500
virtual reality could become good enough
that even its own inhabitants

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.220
didn't know they were in a simulation,
and if you assume

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.520
creating such simulations would be way

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.210
easier than creating real
flesh-and-blood creatures

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.370
that require an entire universe
and billions of years.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:45.240
Well, then it's pretty easy to conclude that
many many many many more simulated,

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:48.770
faked beings could be created than real ones.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:52.240
Say, 999 fake ones for every one

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.040
real one.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.950
What's more likely? 
That you're part of the 0.1%

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:02.840
that are real, or that you are part the 99.9%

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.120
who think they're real but

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.350
aren't. Perhaps, we live in a simulation
created by some other

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.620
intelligent species. John Gribbin,

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:18.290
however, points out one possible way to
dismiss this idea:

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.400
irrational numbers. Like the square root of 2 

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.890
or Pi. These numbers don't

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:28.100
end. I mean, they contain a never-ending,

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:32.370
never repeating sequence of digits, which
would mean that whoever programmed this

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.410
universe could

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:36.410
fit in all of, say, Pi.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:41.130
So, if in our tireless pursuit of
calculating more and more and more

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.310
digits of Pi,

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:46.490
we ever run into an endlessly repeating series

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:51.260
or the end, that could be a pretty good sign that we live

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:55.970
in a simulation. A universe that is not real.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:59.200
But so far we haven't found that and we
don't think that we will.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.920
So, thank you irrational numbers, for keeping

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.959
it real.

00:12:04.959 --> 00:12:06.119
And as always,

00:12:06.119 --> 00:12:07.859
thanks for watching.
