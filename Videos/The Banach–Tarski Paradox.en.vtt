00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.800
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
There's a famous way

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.200
to seemingly create chocolate out of
nothing.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.460
Maybe you've seen it before.
This chocolate bar is

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.750
4 squares by 8 squares, but if you cut it like this

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.189
and then like this and finally like this

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.199
you can rearrange the pieces like so

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.660
and wind up with the same 4 by 8

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.539
bar but with a leftover piece, apparently
created

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.239
out of thin air. There's a popular
animation of this illusion

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.059
as well. I call it an illusion because

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.690
it's just that. Fake.
In reality,

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.460
the final bar is a bit smaller.
It contains

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.030
this much less chocolate. Each square
along the cut is shorter than it was in

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.910
the original,

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.070
but the cut makes it difficult to notice
right away. The animation is

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.579
extra misleading, because it tries to
cover up its deception.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.800
The lost height of each square is
surreptitiously

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.350
added in while the piece moves to make
it hard to notice.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.939
I mean, come on, obviously you cannot cut up
a chocolate bar

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.679
and rearrange the pieces into more than
you started with.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.200
Or can you?
One of the strangest

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.880
theorems in modern mathematics is the
Banach-Tarski

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.340
paradox.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.640
It proves that there is, in fact, a way to
take an object

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.960
and separate it into 5

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.480
different pieces.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.860
And then, with those five pieces, simply

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.710
rearrange them.
No stretching required into

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.720
two exact copies of the original

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.300
item. Same density, same size,

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.480
same everything.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.710
Seriously. To dive into the mind blow

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.500
that it is and the way it fundamentally
questions math

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.790
and ourselves, we have to start by asking
a few questions.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.280
First, what is infinity?

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.640
A number?
I mean, it's nowhere

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.959
on the number line, 
but we often say things like

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.010
there's an infinite "number" of blah-blah-blah.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.410
And as far as we know, infinity could be real.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.620
The universe may be infinite in size

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.459
and flat, extending out for ever and ever

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.500
without end, beyond even the part we can
observe

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.880
or ever hope to observe.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.530
That's exactly what infinity is.
Not a number

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.390
per se, but rather a size.
The size

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.950
of something that doesn't end.
Infinity is not the biggest

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.320
number, instead, it is how many numbers

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.370
there are. But there are different
sizes of infinity.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.370
The smallest type of infinity is

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.940
countable infinity.
The number of hours

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.810
in forever. It's also the number of whole
numbers that there are,

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.830
natural number,  the numbers we use when
counting

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.220
things, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.840
and so on. Sets like these are unending,

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.040
but they are countable. Countable
means that you can count them

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.270
from one element to any other in a

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.280
finite amount of time, even if that finite
amount of time is longer than you

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.160
will live

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.270
or the universe will exist for, it's still finite.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.060
Uncountable infinity, on the other hand, is literally

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.370
bigger.
Too big to even count.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.550
The number of real numbers that there are,

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.020
not just whole numbers, but all numbers is

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.560
uncountably infinite.
You literally cannot count

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.660
even from 0 to 1 in a finite amount of
time by naming

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.910
every real number in between.
I mean,

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.030
where do you even start?
Zero,

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.940
okay. 
But what comes next? 0.000000...

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.290
Eventually, we would imagine a 1

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.609
going somewhere at the end, but there is no end.

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.510
We could always add another 0.
Uncountability

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.150
makes this set so much larger than the set
of all whole numbers

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.100
that even between 0 and 1, there are more numbers

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.080
than there are whole numbers on the
entire endless number line.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.120
Georg Cantor's famous diagonal argument helps

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.180
illustrate this.
Imagine listing every number

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.770
between zero and one. Since they are
uncountable and can't be listed in order,

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.860
let's imagine randomly generating them forever

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.040
with no repeats. Each number regenerate can be paired

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.820
with a whole number. If there's a one to
one correspondence between the two,

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.740
that is if we can match one whole number
to each real number

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.780
on our list, that would mean that countable

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.490
and uncountable sets are the same size.
But we can't do that,

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.840
even though this list goes on for

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.260
ever. Forever isn't enough.
Watch this.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.060
If we go diagonally down our endless
list

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.240
of real numbers and take the first decimal
of the first number

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.210
and the second of the second number,
the third of the third and so on

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.729
and add one to each, subtracting one

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.279
if it happens to be a nine, we can
generate a new

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:41.979
real number that is obviously between 0 and 1,

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:44.990
but since we've defined it to be
different

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.180
from every number on our endless list
and at least one place

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.319
it's clearly not contained in the list.

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.469
In other words, we've used up every
single whole number,

00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:00.020
the entire infinity of them and yet we
can still

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.409
come up with more real numbers.
Here's something else that is true

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:08.759
but counter-intuitive.
There are the same number

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:11.870
of even numbers as there are even

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.419
and odd numbers. At first, that sounds
ridiculous. Clearly, there are only half

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:17.819
as many

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.219
even numbers as all whole numbers,
but that intuition is wrong.

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:25.509
The set of all whole numbers is denser but

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:28.710
every even number can be matched with a
whole number.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.460
You will never run out of members either
set, so this one to one correspondence

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.069
shows that both sets are the same size.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.539
In other words, infinity divided by two

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:44.069
is still infinity.

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:47.449
Infinity plus one is also infinity.

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:50.850
A good illustration of this is Hilbert's
paradox

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.139
up the Grand Hotel.
Imagine a hotel

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:57.900
with a countably infinite number of
rooms. But now,

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.330
imagine that there is a person booked
into every single room.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:07.139
Seemingly, it's fully booked, right?
No.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.680
Infinite sets go against common sense.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.080
You see, if a new guest shows up and wants a room,

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.840
all the hotel has to do is move the
guest in room number 1

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.000
to room number 2. And a guest in room 2 to
room 3 and 3 to 4 and 4 to

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.210
5 and so on.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.650
Because the number of rooms is never ending

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.139
we cannot run out of rooms.
Infinity

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:34.030
-1 is also infinity again.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.159
If one guest leaves the hotel, we can shift

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:40.720
every guest the other way.
Guest 2 goes to room 1,

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.409
3 to 2, 4 to 3 and so on, because we have an

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:48.909
infinite amount of guests. That is a
never ending supply of them.

00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:52.949
No room will be left empty.
As it turns out,

00:07:52.949 --> 00:07:56.610
you can subtract any finite number from infinity

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:00.530
and still be left with infinity.
It doesn't care.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.530
It's unending. Banach-Tarski hasn't left
our sights yet.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.610
All of this is related.
We are now ready to move on

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.270
to shapes.
Hilbert's hotel can be applied

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:15.150
to a circle. Points around the
circumference can be thought of as

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:19.370
guests. If we remove one point from the circle

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:24.580
that point is gone, right?
Infinity tells us

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.669
it doesn't matter.
The circumference of a circle

00:08:27.669 --> 00:08:31.250
is irrational. It's the radius times 2Pi.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.500
So, if we mark off points beginning from
the whole,

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.899
every radius length along the
circumference going clockwise

00:08:38.899 --> 00:08:42.270
we will never land on the same point
twice,

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.610
ever.
We can count off each point we mark

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.760
with a whole number.
So this set is never-ending,

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.390
but countable, just like guests and
rooms in Hilbert's hotel.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.670
And like those guests,
even though one has checked out,

00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:00.070
we can just shift the rest.
Move them

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:04.360
counterclockwise and every room will be
filled

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.590
Point 1 moves to fill in the hole, point 2

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.950
fills in the place where point 1 used to be,
3 fills in 2

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:16.050
and so on. Since we have a unending
supply of numbered points,

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.130
no hole will be left unfilled.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:24.190
The missing point is forgotten.
We apparently never needed it

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:28.600
to be complete. There's one last needo
consequence of infinity

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.980
we should discuss before tackling Banach-Tarski.
Ian Stewart

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.260
famously proposed a brilliant dictionary.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.540
One that he called the Hyperwebster.
The Hyperwebster

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:44.070
lists every single possible word of any length

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.560
formed from the 26 letters in the
English alphabet.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.330
It begins with "a," followed by "aa,"

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.410
then "aaa," then "aaaa."

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.750
And after an infinite number of those, "ab,"

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:01.950
then "aba," then "abaa", "abaaa,"

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.130
and so on until "z, "za,"

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.290
"zaa," et cetera, et cetera,
until the final entry in

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:11.920
infinite sequence of "z"s.
Such

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.990
a dictionary would contain every

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.480
single word.
Every single thought,

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.010
definition, description, truth, lie, name,

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:25.240
story.
What happened to Amelia Earhart would be

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:29.220
in that dictionary,
as well as every single thing that

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.970
didn't happened to Amelia Earhart.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.260
Everything that could be said using our

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:39.500
alphabet.
Obviously, it would be huge,

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.010
but the company publishing it might
realize that they could take

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.800
a shortcut. If they put all the words
that begin with

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.960
a in a volume titled "A,"

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.210
they wouldn't have to print the initial "a."
Readers would know to just add the "a,"

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:57.320
because it's the "a" volume.
By removing the initial

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.760
"a," the publisher is left with every "a" word

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.310
sans the first "a," which has surprisingly

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:07.910
become every possible word.
Just one

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:12.820
of the 26 volumes has been
decomposed into the entire thing.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.620
It is now that we're ready to
investigate this video's

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:21.270
titular paradox.
What if we turned an object,

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.710
a 3D thing into a Hyperwebster?

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:28.700
Could we decompose pieces of it into the
whole thing?

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.360
Yes.
The first thing we need to do

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.890
is give every single point on the
surface of the sphere

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:40.940
one name and one name only. A good way to
do this is to name them after how they

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:43.620
can be reached by a given starting point.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:47.740
If we move this starting point across
the surface of the sphere

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:51.740
in steps that are just the right length,
no matter how many times

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:55.110
or in what direction we rotate, so long
as we never

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:58.420
backtrack, it will never wind up in the
same place

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:03.080
twice. We only need to rotate in four
directions to achieve this paradox.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.280
Up, down, left and right around

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.000
two perpendicular axes.
We are going to need

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.230
every single possible sequence that can
be made

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:17.270
of any finite length out of just these
four rotations.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:20.270
That means we will need lef, right,

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:24.250
up and down as well as left left,

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.460
left up, left down, but of course not

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.010
left right, because, well, that's
backtracking. Going left

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:34.760
and then right means you're the same as
you were before you did anything, so

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.870
no left rights, no right lefts and no up
downs and

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:42.220
no down ups. Also notice that I'm writing
the rotations in order

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.300
right to left, so the final rotation

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.950
is the leftmost letter.
That will be important later on.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:53.960
Anyway. A list of all possible sequences
of allowed rotations that are finite

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.040
in lenght is, well,

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.210
huge. Countably infinite, in fact.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.580
But if we apply each one of them to a
starting point

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.880
in green here and then name the point we
land on

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.930
after the sequence that brought us there,
we can name

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:13.190
a countably infinite set of points
on the surface.

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:17.050
Let's look at how, say, these four strings
on our list would work.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:21.850
Right up left. Okay, rotating the starting
point this way takes

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:27.260
us here. Let's colour code the point
based on the final rotation in its string,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:31.190
in this case it's left and for that we will use

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.339
purple.
Next up down down.

00:13:34.339 --> 00:13:38.730
That sequence takes us here.
We name the point DD

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.959
and color it blue, since we ended with a down

00:13:41.959 --> 00:13:46.100
rotation.
RDR, that will be this point's name,

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.880
takes us here.
And for a final right rotation,

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.990
let's use red.
Finally, for a sequence that end with

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:56.070
up, let's colour code the point orange.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:59.290
Now, if we imagine completing this
process for

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:03.740
every single sequence, we will have a
countably infinite number of points

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:04.330
named

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.510
and color-coded.
That's great, but

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:11.270
not enough.
There are an uncountably

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:15.110
infinite number of points on a sphere's surface.

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:18.140
But no worries, we can just pick a point
we missed.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.560
Any point and color it green, making it

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.350
a new starting point and then run every
sequence

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:28.660
from here.
After doing this to an

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.450
uncountably infinite number of
starting point we will have indeed

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:35.990
named and colored every single point on
the surface

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:39.709
just once.
With the exception

00:14:39.709 --> 00:14:44.390
of poles. Every sequence has two poles of
rotation.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:48.740
Locations on the sphere that come back to
exactly where they started.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.130
For any sequence of right or left

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.300
rotations, the polls are the north and
south poles.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:59.580
The problem with poles like these is
that more than one sequence can lead us

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:00.280
to them.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.850
They can be named more than once and be colored

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:08.290
in more than one color. For example, if
you follow some other sequence to the

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:09.680
north or south pole,

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.990
any subsequent rights or lefts will

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:17.490
be equally valid names. In order to deal
with this we're going to just count them out

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:17.750
of the

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.470
normal scheme and color them all yellow.
Every sequence has two,

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:24.580
so there are a countably infinite amount

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:28.540
of them. Now, with every point on the
sphere given just

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:33.860
one name and just one of six colors,
we are ready to take the entire sphere

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:38.860
apart. Every point on the surface
corresponds to a unique line of points

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:39.630
below it

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:43.270
all the way to the center point.
And we will be dragging

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:47.330
every point's line along with it.
The lone center point

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:52.200
we will set aside. Okay, first we cut out
and extract all the yellow

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.370
poles, the green starting points, the

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:59.390
orange up points, the blue down points

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:02.730
and the red and purple left and right
points.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.100
That's the entire sphere.
With just

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:10.590
these pieces you could build the whole
thing. But take a look at the left piece.

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:13.770
It is defined by being a piece composed of

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:17.220
every point, accessed via a sequence ending

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.340
with a left rotation.
If we rotate this piece

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:24.730
right, that's the same as adding an "R" to

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:28.250
every point's name.
But left and then right

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:32.200
is a backtrack, they cancel each other
out. And look what happens when you

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:32.980
reduce

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.980
them away. The set becomes the same

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.550
as a set of all points with names
that end with L,

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:44.540
but also U, D and every point reached

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.870
with no rotation.
That's the full set of starting points.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:53.040
We have turned less than a quarter of
the sphere into nearly three-quarters

00:16:53.040 --> 00:17:00.220
just by rotating it. We added nothing. It's like
the Hyperwebster. If we had the right

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:00.920
piece

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.650
and the poles of rotation and the center
point, well, we've got the entire sphere

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:09.760
again, but with stuff left over.
To make a second copy,

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.260
let's rotate the up piece down.
The

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.959
down ups cancel because, well,
it's the same as going nowhere

00:17:16.959 --> 00:17:20.250
and we're left with a set of all
starting points, the entire

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:24.550
up piece, the right piece and the left
piece, but there's a problem here.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:28.730
We don't need this extra set of starting
points. We still haven't

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:32.700
used the original ones. No worries, let's just
start over.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.700
We can just move everything from the up
piece

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.810
that turns into a starting point when
rotated down.

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:42.630
That means every point whose final
rotation is up. Let's put them

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:47.400
in the piece. Of course, after rotating
points named

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.920
UU will just turn into points named U,
and that would give us a copy here

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.130
and here.
So, as it turns out, we need to move

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:58.770
all points with any name that is just a string of Us.

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:01.960
We will put them in the down piece and
rotate the up

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.170
piece down, which makes it congruent to
the up right

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:09.040
and left pieces, add in the down piece
along with some up

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.929
and the starting point piece and, well,
we're almost done.

00:18:12.929 --> 00:18:15.860
The poles of rotation and center are missing

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.789
from this copy, but no worries.
There's a countably

00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:22.659
infinite number of holes,
where the poles of rotations used to be,

00:18:22.659 --> 00:18:28.130
which means there is some pole around
which we can rotate this sphere such that

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:32.070
every pole hole orbits around without
hitting another.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.649
Well, this is just a bunch of circles
with one point missing.

00:18:35.649 --> 00:18:40.520
We fill them each like we did earlier.
And we do the same for the centerpoint.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.039
Imagine a circle that contains it inside
the sphere

00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:47.270
and just fill in from infinity and look
what we've done.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:53.330
We have taken one sphere and turned it
into two identical spheres

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:56.679
without adding anything.

00:18:56.679 --> 00:19:01.159
One plus one equals 1.
That took

00:19:01.159 --> 00:19:04.929
a while to go through,
but the implications are huge.

00:19:04.929 --> 00:19:09.600
And mathematicians, scientists and
philosophers are still debating them.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.570
Could such a process happen in the real
world?

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:18.789
I mean, it can happen mathematically and
math allows us to abstractly predict and

00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:21.320
describe a lot of things in the real
world

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:26.039
with amazing accuracy, but does the Banach-Tarski paradox

00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:29.929
take it too far?
Is it a place where math and physics

00:19:29.929 --> 00:19:33.330
separate?
We still don't know.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:37.999
History is full of examples of
mathematical concepts developed in the

00:19:37.999 --> 00:19:38.749
abstract

00:19:38.749 --> 00:19:42.590
that we did not think would ever apply
to the real world

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:47.090
for years, decades, centuries,
until eventually science caught up and

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:50.210
realized they were totally applicable

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:56.769
and useful. The Banach-Tarski paradox could
actually happen in our real-world,

00:19:56.769 --> 00:20:01.200
the only catch of course is that the
five pieces you cut your object into

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.440
aren't simple shapes.
They must be infinitely complex

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:10.899
and detailed. That's not possible to do in
the real world, where measurements can

00:20:10.899 --> 00:20:12.340
only get so small

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:16.980
and there's only a finite amount of time
to do anything, but math says it's

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.509
theoretically valid and some scientists

00:20:19.509 --> 00:20:22.720
think it may be physically valid too.

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.400
There have been a number of papers
published suggesting

00:20:26.409 --> 00:20:29.619
a link between by Banach-Tarski

00:20:29.619 --> 00:20:32.950
and the way tiny tiny sub-atomic
particles

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:38.010
can collide at high energies and turn
into more particles

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:39.510
than we began with.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.620
We are finite creatures. Our lives

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:51.360
are small and can only scientifically
consider a small part of

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.909
reality.
What's common for us is just

00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:59.029
a sliver of what's available. We can
only see so much of the electromagnetic

00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.990
spectrum.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:03.429
We can only delve so deep into
extensions of space.

00:21:03.429 --> 00:21:07.370
Common sense applies to that which we
can

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:10.789
access.
But common sense is just that.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.020
Common.
If total sense

00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:18.700
is what we want, we should be prepared to
accept that we shouldn't call infinity

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.330
weird or strange.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:24.669
The results we've arrived at by
accepting it are valid,

00:21:24.669 --> 00:21:28.919
true within the system we use to
understand, measure, predict and order the

00:21:28.919 --> 00:21:29.740
universe.

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:34.289
Perhaps the system still needs
perfecting, but at the end of day,

00:21:34.289 --> 00:21:38.980
history continues to show us that the
universe isn't strange.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.800
We are.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:44.610
And as always,

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:46.570
thanks for watching.

00:22:06.779 --> 00:22:10.690
Finally, as always, the description is full
of links to learn more.

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:14.090
There are also a number of books linked
down there that really helped me

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:17.389
wrap my mind kinda around Banach-Tarski.

00:22:17.389 --> 00:22:22.330
First of all, Leonard Wapner's "The Pea and the Sun." This book is fantastic and it's full of

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:23.929
lot of the preliminaries needed

00:22:23.929 --> 00:22:27.659
to understand the proof that comes later.
He also talks a lot about the

00:22:27.659 --> 00:22:28.940
ramifications

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:33.019
of what Banach-Tarski and their
theorem might mean for mathematics.

00:22:33.019 --> 00:22:36.869
Also, if you wanna talk about math and
whether it's discovered or invented,

00:22:36.869 --> 00:22:37.720
whether

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:41.659
it really truly will map onto the universe,
Yanofsky's

00:22:41.659 --> 00:22:45.090
"The Outer Limits of Reason" is great.

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:49.019
This is the favorite book of mine that I've read
this entire year. Another good one is E.

00:22:49.019 --> 00:22:50.139
Brian Davies'

00:22:50.139 --> 00:22:53.489
"Why Beliefs Matter." This is actually
Corn's favorite book,

00:22:53.489 --> 00:22:57.389
as you might be able to see there.
It's delicious and full of lots of great

00:22:57.389 --> 00:22:59.759
information about the limits of what we
can know

00:22:59.759 --> 00:23:03.919
and what science is and what mathematics is.

00:23:03.919 --> 00:23:08.399
If you love infinity and math, I cannot
more highly recommend Matt Parker's

00:23:08.399 --> 00:23:11.720
"Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension." He's hilarious and this book

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:11.960
is

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.309
very very great at explaining some pretty
awesome things.

00:23:15.309 --> 00:23:19.230
So keep reading,
and if you're looking for something to watch,

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:22.730
I hope you've already watched Kevin
Lieber's film on

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:26.109
Field Day. I already did a documentary about Whittier, Alaska over there.

00:23:26.109 --> 00:23:29.619
Kevin's got a great short film about
putting things out on the Internet

00:23:29.619 --> 00:23:32.809
and having people react to them. There's
a rumor that Jake Roper might be doing

00:23:32.809 --> 00:23:34.179
something on Field Day soon.

00:23:34.179 --> 00:23:37.269
So check out mine, check out Kevin's and

00:23:37.269 --> 00:23:41.139
subscribe to Field Day for upcoming Jake
Roper action, yeah?

00:23:41.139 --> 00:23:45.509
He's actually in this room right now, say
hi, Jake. [Jake:] Hi. Thanks for filming this, by

00:23:45.509 --> 00:23:46.029
the way.

00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:49.950
Guys, I really appreciate who you all are.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:51.630
And as always,

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:52.750
thanks for watching.
