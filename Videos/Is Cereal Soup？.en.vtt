00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.700
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.320
Take a look at this.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.180
Simple enough, right?

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.180
But watch what happens next.  

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.860
Okay, what the heck is this thing?

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.860
Mostly people eat it like a soup,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.220
out of a  bowl with a spoon. 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.000
But is it a soup?

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.700
The word 'soup' comes from words that originally meant

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.140
 "to absorb liquid", which dry cereal
left in milk too long will do.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.200
But words change.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.240
What if cereal is actually a type of salad?

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.880
And milk is just a dressing?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.440
Or maybe, dry cereal is the actual meal and

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.220
milk is just a condiment or a coating.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.220
Adding milk to dry cereal might be like adding

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.790
ketchup to french fries, or icing a cake.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.480
Honestly, there is no real answer. The answer

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.830
is whatever we agree the answer should be.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.260
We make up the words and we make up the categories.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.580
If you ask me, cereal is soup, but it's not
soup soup.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.240
Cereal is also salad, but it's not

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.960
salad salad.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.180
What I just did there is
called reduplication.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.619
We do it all the time

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.379
but usually for emphasis. For example,

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:31.779
 "I like you" but I also like like you.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.980
Tomorrow's event is fancy, but it's not fancy fancy.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.499
When I say "soup soup" or "salad salad", I

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:46.159
am using reduplication in a way that is known
as Contrastive focus reduplication. I am reduplicating

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.740
a word to express a focus on prototypical
types of that word,

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.000
in contrast to French types.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.240
A Caesar or vegetable are more prototypical

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.240
types of salad than, say, potato, taco, fruit,
or a bowl of cereal with milk.

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:11.069
The increasing progress of technology forces
us to contrastively focus reduplicate more

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.249
and more often.

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:14.769
For example, now when talking about a book,

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.870
you might need to clarify whether it is an
e-book or a book book.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.970
The original physical paper type.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.650
The phrase paper book is a retronym.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.680
A modification to an old word made necessary
by the advent and popularisation of something

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:31.629
new.

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.100
Before movies with sound came along,

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.600
silent movies were just called movies.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.820
Before voicemail and e-mail, snail mail was
just mail.

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:47.060
And before mobile phones, your landline or
home phone was simply a phone.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.820
Or in many cases just the phone.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.480
This is Morse code for a smiley face emoticon.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.040
It's a happy beat.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.860
The eyes of the emoticon are a colon,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.100
which up until as recently as the middle of the
1900s was often used with a dash

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.180
to represent a pause.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.040
It was an especially helpful direction to

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.700
people reading text out loud.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.360
It was used all over the place.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.209
In personal letters and

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.629
all over America's Declaration of Independence.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.760
You may also notice that it looks a little

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:27.559
bit 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.559
anatomical.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.900
The Oxford English Dictionary has a name for

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.120
this punctuation mark

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.100
and that name is

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.480
"the dog's bollocks".

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.100
In other words, dog balls.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.300
Although other emoticons were definitely used

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:52.459
earlier, as far as official dictionary entries
are concerned, the very first emoticon with

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.199
an official name was an emoticon for a willy.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
This also means that America's Declaration

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:00.959
of Independence is, 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.879
punctuation-wise,

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.400
covered in dog wieners.

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.369
Nine of them, to be exact.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.320
What I'm about to do is called drawing.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.870
When I am finished,

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.270
what I have created is called 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.260
a drawing.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.240
But it's finished. Shouldn't it be called "a drawn"?

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.259
A similar version of this problem is often
attributed to Steven Wright.

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.710
Why are they called buildings if they are finished?

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.330
Shouldn't they be called "builds"?

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330
What's really going on here is a phenomenon

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.040
known as 'verbal nouns'.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.600
A noun formed from a verb.

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:47.020
It's often easier to "noun-ify" a verb than
to just use lots of words.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.520
Why call this a structure resulting from the
active of building, when you could just call

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.280
it a building?

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.280
Where does the word 'nickname' come from?

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.740
Did a guy name Nicholas one day decided everyone
could call him Nick and in doing so create

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.300
a literal nickname?

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.980
No.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.140
Nickname is a product of rebracketing.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.300
A process in which speakers, often unknowingly, create

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.370
new words by moving sounds from one word to another.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.170
For instance, the English word alligator is
a corruption of the Spanish "el lagarto" -

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.370
the lizard.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.630
El lagarto, el lagarto, el, alligator.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.740
Eke used to mean "also",

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.740
as in you could have a name,

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.580
and you could have another name that

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.660
was also your name.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.520
Your "eke name". 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.620
Eke name. Eke name. Ni, ni, nickname.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.920
Here's another funny thing about language.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.530
If you're noisy in class, you're disrupting class.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.410
But if you sit around silently paying attention,

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.150
are you

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.140
rupting class?

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.370
You can be disgruntled, but can you ever be gruntled?

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:06.569
Words that would seem to have a related word
but actually do not are called unpaired words.

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:11.169
Maybe they were in a pair at one point in
history, or maybe through a fluke of etymology

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:17.349
they only seem to have one, but what you think
it would be isn't in any dictionary.

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:23.220
Some definitions like "soup" and "salad" are
so vague their borders are almost hilariously

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.080
fuzzy.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.180
Other words, well, they're just plain silly.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.270
For example, the sun does not rise every morning.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.700
The Earth actually just turns you toward it,

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.390
but yet our word for that phenomenon is sunrise.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.260
Languages are full of expressions like that.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:47.660
George Steiner wrote colourfully about this,
saying "The accelerando of the sciences, and

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.760
of technology, have beggared both the reach and veracity of natural language.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.060
 In consequence,

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.289
the commonplace relations of language to phenomenon
to our daily context have become virtually

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:00.849
infantile.

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:05.469
They are a bric-a-brac of inner
metaphors, of whory fictions and handy falsifications.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.750
From the perspective of the theoretical and
exact sciences, we speak a kind of neanderthal

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.210
babble."

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.990
Whether spoken or typed or tabbed or felt

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.490
or signalled,

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:22.500
language may be inevitably full of idiomatic expressions and expressions that are

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.740
incomplete.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:25.980
And categories

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.380
that are fuzzy.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.040
But hey,

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.040
at least it's our fuzz, and at least

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.560
fuzz is entertaining.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.300
It would be nice to just know everything and have absolutely nothing

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.780
to explain or demonstrate to anyone else.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.520
But then again,

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.940
as Emily Dickinson once said,

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:50.000
"a letter is a joy of earth. It is denied
the Gods".

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.789
If we were all omniscient, we'd have no reason
to write letter to one another, there wouldn't

00:07:54.789 --> 00:08:00.699
be anything new you had to tell someone else. We would have no reason to debate the soupiness

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:03.079
or saladness of cereal.

00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:05.979
No reason to wonder, no reason to read, or

00:08:05.979 --> 00:08:07.359
to watch.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.720
I'd have no reason to say and as always,

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.500
thanks for watching.
