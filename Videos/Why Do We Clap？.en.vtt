00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.590
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:09.800
The loudest clap
ever recorded clocked in at 113

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.740
decibels. And the world record for
fastest clapping was recently set at

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.930
802 claps per minute.
Clapping

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.380
is the most common human body noise others

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.289
are meant to hear
that doesn't involve the vocal cords.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.750
It's a great built-in percussion instrument.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.739
But clapping has also become a
collective social gesture that we use in

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.610
groups to express admiration,

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.809
approval.
Especially for things that happen

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.309
on stage.

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:48.520
So here I am on stage.
But to show approval, to show that they like

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:55.520
things, why do humans clap?
Amazing question!

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.560
When applauding, a person creates claps 
at a rate of about 2.5-5 claps per

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.380
second.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.390
Kinetic energy from the hands is
converted into acoustic energy,

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.880
mainly within the 2200 to 2800 hertz

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.830
range, the frequencies clap on, clap off devices

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.420
detect.
But many other frequencies are created during a single

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.070
clap.
And different hand positions create different spectra

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.490
of frequencies, most of which are not
whole number multiples of each other,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.979
which is why a clap

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.170
can't make a musical note.
A discernible

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.700
definite pitch the way a clarinet or piano

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.840
or the human voice can.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.880
If vocalisations can be so finely controlled,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.720
why clap?
I mean, it's such a crude,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.590
messy noise.
Well, at a fundamental

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.330
and physiological level the impulse to clap

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.140
may have originated as a reaction to an overflowing

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.450
of enthusiasm, an immediate and primitive reaction

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.580
to excitement.
Steven Connor colourfully puts it this way:

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.980
"If the distinctive sound of the human is the sound of

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.739
language, then sound produced
from other places than the mouth,

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.260
always has the taint of the gratuitous,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.780
 the excessive, or the proscribed.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.400
Clapping is the benign superflux of the body,
the diarrhoea

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.470
of sound."
He calls it a spilling over

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.019
of feeling.
A burst of energy unfiltered by language

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.350
or thought.
It's a way to burn off extra enthusiasm,

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.650
but if clapping is so natural and involuntary to the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.860
individual,
how did it become coded into western

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.430
etiquette? An expected behavior you
sometimes feel pressured to do,

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.000
even if you don't want to.
Desmond Morris called

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.019
modern clapping patting a performer on the back

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.110
from a distance.
And other theories have called clapping

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.700
high fiving yourself for something someone else

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.740
has done.
But in its current form there is another thing

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.599
besides yourself and the performance
that might be truly driving

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.479
applause.
A super organism called

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.740
The Crowd. A study published in the
Journal of the Royal Society found that

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.569
an individual's contribution to applause
seems to have less to do with their

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:28.290
actual

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.000
opinion as to the quality of the
performance and has more to do with

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.190
the behavior

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.690
of the collective group,

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.040
the anonymous.
Group voice aspect of applause

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.520
also makes sense, when you consider
the fact that clapping is a great

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.650
equalizer. Studies have shown that, as
opposed to vocalizations, which can

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.750
betray a lot

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.400
about the people who make them,
subjects cannot guess better than chance,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.220
whether the clap they hear
is from a man or a woman,

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.890
nor can they guess the size
of the individual, based solely

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.160
on the sound of their clap.
Clapping

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.530
may have become the standard nonverbal
gesture of admiration, because it is

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.130
arguably the loudest, the easiest
and the most democratic.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.530
Performers can't here a thumbs-up or

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.110
a wink.
Not everyone can snap their fingers

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.789
and clapping is less disruptive than stomping feet or

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.830
waving around big objects.
Moreover,

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.460
historically, authorities have encouraged

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.080
clapping.
In the sixth century BC,

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.000
Cleisthenes came to power in Ancient
Greece as a democratic reformer

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.680
and made behaviors like clapping a civic

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.979
duty, the proper way for the masses to express

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.990
admiration for their leader.
There wasn't enough time for

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.060
everyone to meet and greet his or her leader,

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.950
but they could all greet their leader together,

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.169
as one super organism

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:08.310
with one voice - applause.
By the early 19th century

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.800
the desire to code appropriate group reactions and

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.409
encourage them by example was quite official.

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:18.840
Agencies offered claques for hire,

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.840
professional applauders, who would memorize operas,

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.360
attend them, like normal opera goers, and clap,

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.830
cry or laugh at appropriate times, so that the

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.930
actual audience would know when to properly

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.479
do what.
It's interesting that five or

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:40.930
six months after being born human babies
begin to realize that their hands

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.540
can work together.
Clapping is a natural reaction to this realization

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.360
but parenting books have to advise parents to teach

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.570
their children to connect clapping with group

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.889
happiness and celebration.
The connection itself

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.389
not being inevitable.
To this day,

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:05.030
applause signs reinforce audience
behavior, simply because those with the

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.590
authority are requesting it.
Not because

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.320
it is a natural reaction
but because it can be, and

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.220
historically has been, socially imposed.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.479
So, what's the future

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:23.850
of applauds?
Well, last week

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.050
I hung out with the guys from Grand Illusions,

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.870
really fascinating channel.
And they pointed out something strange.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:38.120
How many times have you listened
to your favorite song?

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.610
Probably quite a few, right?
You've listened to songs you

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.030
don't like plenty of times.
But as recently

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.090
as a 150 year ago, people

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.850
only heard their favorite symphony

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.009
maybe two or three times in their entire

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:00.229
life.
If you wanted music, you had to go to a concert

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:04.050
or pick up an instrument or sing.
There was no other

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.229
way.
But now, because of recorded music,

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:11.259
MP3 players and phones and tablets and
personal computers and digital libraries

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:12.639
allow us to be an

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:16.120
audience of one.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.900
An audience all by ourselves,
not just when professionals get together

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.449
and draw a crown.
In the 1990s,

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:27.380
Faith Popcorn gave this broader phenomenon a name:

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.600
cocooning.
The Internet, home entertainment,

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.770
cell phones, alarm systems, self-checkout,

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.960
filters for our personal air and water

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.979
are all paraphernalia of cocooning.

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:45.360
A tendency toward more lonely,
solitary experiences in the last

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.229
30 years.
In my episode about the friend zone,

00:07:49.229 --> 00:07:52.430
I talk about how cocooning might be making

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:57.030
friendship, meeting new people
and new unexpected ideas

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:00.460
a veining experience.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.740
But applause is safe, right?
I mean, applause isn't about meeting new

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.199
people, it's about becoming them.

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:11.179
Becoming a super organism
that speaks with one

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:16.220
unindividuated roar.
And concerts and live performances are still

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:20.020
big parts of our lives.
But what's fascinating

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.470
is that more entertainment is more available

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.400
than ever before.
And despite being TV shows,

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.470
movies, games and music, this

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.900
new entertainment is increasingly consumed

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.030
like books.
In solitude,

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.579
alone.
You don't need to applaud alone

00:08:40.579 --> 00:08:44.720
in a cocoon, but to be sure,
alone on the Internet we don't applaud but we do

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.069
like and share and favorite and retweet.

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:51.680
Those actions might be a sort of ersatz

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.130
applause.
In real life your clap is

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.530
lost in the crowd,
aggregated into the total sound.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.550
And online, so are your likes and favorites.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:05.720
They join a collective gesture as a sort of

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:11.449
digital applause. A pessimist might feel
like these new collective gestures are

00:09:11.449 --> 00:09:15.660
hollow, lonely, a sad replacement for actual

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.839
social experiences.
But what's really happening?

00:09:19.839 --> 00:09:22.959
Because a like is not necessarily

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:27.180
lonely.
A retweet by its very nature isn't a clap

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.510
lost in the crowd, it's a clap that joins the crowd,

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:34.400
but is also traceable directly back to you.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.130
Maybe cocooning, maybe the rise of applause

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.380
substitutes, like digital applause, is something

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:46.110
to be worried about, or maybe it's the
natural result of having so many

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.809
applause-worthy things just a few clicks away.

00:09:49.809 --> 00:09:54.130
We can't applaud all of them,
so we have evolved more scaleable

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:58.760
reactions, which, incidentally, are more personal,

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.780
instead of being pathetic clicks

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:06.350
from an increasingly isolated, cocooned population.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:10.170
Digital applause might be like something
else that comes from cocoons

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.569
and having more of them.
Something beautiful.

00:10:13.569 --> 00:10:14.849
Butterflies.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.480
And as always,

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:17.470
thanks for watching.
