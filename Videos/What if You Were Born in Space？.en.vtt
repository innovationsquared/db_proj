00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.020
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
How many people

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.140
are in space right now

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.769
dot com tells us that the answer

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.940
is 6. Ever since the first person reached

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.740
outer space 52 years ago, more than 500 humans

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.400
have left Earth and they've gone as far as the moon,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.010
an impressive distance. I mean, space
stations, which we use in outer space

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.820
today

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.230
are way cool, but to scale they only

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.270
orbit about this far away from Earth.
Whereas

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.590
the Moon, where Apollo astronauts went,

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.600
is way out

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.059
here.
For the last twelve years,

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.320
there has been a continuous and
uninterrupted presence

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.020
of humans living in space.
Different people at different times,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.609
ever since November of 2001.
But so far,

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.049
all of us, every human who has

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.890
ever existed was born right here on

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.350
Earth. Of course, Earth is a giant
collection of matter that got together

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.159
in space,

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.909
held together by its own gravity, so technically,

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.159
we were all born in space.
But I wanna talk about

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.259
outer space.
What is our

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.079
relation to it and within it?

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.750
How suited is our biology for the
larger universe we were born into?

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.650
More specifically, if you were born and raised

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.500
beyond earth, what would you look like?

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.560
First things first.
Where

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.100
is outer space?
Well, outer space happens to be

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.909
about one hundred thousand meters above your head.

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.420
At that point the atmosphere is so thin

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.530
that in order to achieve lift, an
aircraft has to travel at a speed

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.310
so quickly that that speed is the same

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.590
as an orbital speed.
An orbital speed

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.550
is a speed that is so fast, even with no lift,

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.450
even while falling you don't,

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.610
because the earth literally curves

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.739
away from you as fast as you fall

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.560
towards it. This is what astronauts in
the International Space Station are

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.620
really doing.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.769
They're falling. It's a common misconception
that astronauts float around

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.629
weightless in space, 
because there is no gravity there.

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.410
But there's plenty of gravity.
In fact, there's pretty much the same amount of

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.970
gravity

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.450
operating on them that there is
operating on you

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.890
right now while you watch this video.
Believe it or not,

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.760
if we build a tower all the way up to
where the International Space Station

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.890
orbits, 370,000 meters high,

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.069
and you walked out onto the top of that
tower, it would feel kind of like this.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.480
You would just be walking around like I'm walking

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.540
right now. You wouldn't feel that much different,

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.330
but the International Space Station
would be whizzing by

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.720
at 17,000 miles per hour.
It has to,

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.830
because they are falling. So to say that
astronauts float around in

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.430
orbit, because they are experiencing zero gravity

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.280
is very misleading.
Really, what they are feeling

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.599
is Zero-G, where G is accelleration

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.519
felt as weight.
G hurts

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.650
so good, because gravity's limiting influence

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.140
insures that we develop correctly and healthfully.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.349
After all, it is what we were born to thrive in.

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.659
So asking what a human would look like, if conceived

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.980
gestated, delivered and raised in orbit

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.269
would look like, requires a discussion of weightlessness.

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.980
Realistically, people building colonies
on planets beyond Earth

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.069
or traveling through space for long
periods of time,

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.349
who expected new humans to be born, would
utilize technology that helped mimic

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.400
conditions here on earth.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.239
But until artificial gravity is
perfected and can be easily implemented,

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.860
it's important to understand the effect
weightlessness has on

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.199
our biology and other things.
For instance,

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.370
in a zero-g environment hot air doesn't

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.350
rise.
So a candle flame is not shaped like a stretched

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.430
ball of glowing gas that's drawn upward.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.530
Instead, it's just a round

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.639
ball of hot gas.

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.479
We are not sure we can make babies

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.880
in space. The logistics of merely
hugging are difficult enough.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.860
A recent invention, called the '2suit',
might make it easier.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.740
The 2suit provides effortless intimacy
in weightless environment, such as

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.190
outer space or on planets with low gravity.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.300
But will it be enough to ensure that
conception happens?

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.470
The enzyme responsible for stopping the
movement of a sperm cell's

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.600
tale doesn't work very well when they're at zero-g.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.180
In space, sperms

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.509
swim faster.
One thing we know about babies

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:26.530
inside mothers in space involves the development

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.410
of the vestibular system. Canals in the
inner ear that use the flow of fluid

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.639
to determine movement, up versus down and balance.

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:41.320
In a zero-g environment the fluid in the
vestibular system just floats around.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.009
It's confused.
And this can lead to motion sickness,

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:48.460
visual illusions and disorientation.
It's called

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.570
spaced adaptation syndrome and it
affects about 50 percent

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.449
of astronauts.
Confusion about motion can make you

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:00.569
vomit, carsick, seasick, zero-g sick,

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:04.360
because of survival.
It's believed that

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.069
motion sickness, a confusion about acceleration,

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:13.030
is similar to the effects caused by the
consumption of poisonous plants,

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.490
in which case vomiting can save your life.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.020
Pregnant rats taken to space

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.110
give birth to babies back on earth that
struggle with directions.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.699
Unlike rat babies that gestated here on earth,

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:31.729
the ones that gestated in space have
trouble writing themselves when thrown

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:32.960
into water.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.500
They do tend to be better at processing
orientations common during

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.020
weightlessness,

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.150
which is a good sign for humans gestated,

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.900
born and raised in space, but it's some of the only

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.500
good news. Vestibular fluid isn't the
only fluid to be affected by a zero-G

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.690
environment.
All of your body fluids are. On

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.330
earth, gravity pulls those fluids down, but in

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.699
orbit, the fluid is free to evenly distribute,

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:05.810
giving astronauts their characteristic
bird legs and puffy faces.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:11.520
Cosmetically it's kind of a bummer.
And all of that new fluid pressure in your face

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.349
can compromise vision. Of 27
astronauts studied after long space

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:17.139
flights

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:20.419
nine had fluid expansion around the optic nerve,

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:24.699
6 had eyeballs flattened in the back by fluid pressure

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:28.199
and four had bulging optic nerves.

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:31.830
More fluid pressure in your head causes 
an errant message

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:36.440
that your body must have too much fluid.
So the bodies of zero-G travelers

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.919
respond by

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:43.330
producing less blood. Astronauts can lose
up to 22 percent of their total blood

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:44.220
volume

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.479
while in space, leading to weaker

00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:51.729
atrophied hearts.
Away from Earth's protection,

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:55.169
radiation from the Sun, and the rest of the universe,

00:07:55.169 --> 00:07:59.740
is incredibly dangerous and we're still
not exactly sure how to best guard

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:00.810
against it.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:06.370
Mice exposed to levels of radiation
expected during interplanetary journeys

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:10.889
showed signs of different brain blood
flow and larger plaques of the type

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:12.190
found in patients

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.210
with Alzheimer's.
Psychologically,

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:19.870
feelings of isolation in space,
thinking about just how far away you are

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.669
from the rest of humanity

00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:25.870
can affect you physically. Scientists
working at the South Pole have developed

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.870
compromised immune systems

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.800
with fewer T-cells.
As for the shape of your body,

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.089
fully grown astronauts in orbit, no longer pressed

00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:38.659
down by earth typical g-force experience

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:43.589
spinal expansion, sometimes growing by as
much as 3 percent

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:46.970
before they come back to Earth.
A 6-foot-tall human

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.700
can go to space and come back as a 6-foot 2-inch tall

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:55.190
person. 
Without usual and necessary stress,

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:59.540
bones in space atrophy at a rate of
about one percent

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.010
per month.
Given enough time, total bone mass

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:06.990
lost can be as high as 40 to 60 percent.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.640
And when weightless, you don't need as
much muscle strength to

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.640
move around. This causes the muscles of
people weightless in space to atrophy.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.459
Those that you use to fight gravity can
shrink 5 percent per month,

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:24.620
for total muscle mass loss of 20 percent.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.399
It's all kind of scary and sad.

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:33.310
But don't bother crying over it, 
because without 1G to pull them down,

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.800
tears don't work the same way in space.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.540
Astronaut Chris Hadfield makes excellent
videos about how things happen

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:41.390
differently

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:46.990
in orbit. For instance, tears just pool
upon your face due to surface tension.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:50.600
In space you can cry, but as he says,

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.399
the tears don't fall.
We know that these problems exist for

00:09:55.399 --> 00:09:58.870
adults in space.
Theoretically they would affect

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.519
developing children in space even more so.

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:06.320
Parallels have been drawn between the
way a child skeleton would likely

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.149
develop in

00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:10.399
orbit and diseases that cause weak

00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:14.350
and soft bones here on earth.
Bones that break and heal

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:18.750
according to different forces than the
typical downward ones,

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:23.399
like Rickets. It's tenable to say that
without proper precautions,

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:27.540
exercise and care, like adult astronauts already take,

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.209
children developing in space could look like this.

00:10:31.209 --> 00:10:34.720
Not because of Rickets or a lack of vitamin D,

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.000
but because the usual forces and active
use required for healthy bone

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.089
development

00:10:40.089 --> 00:10:43.500
just wouldn't be there.
Added to the other threats,

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.570
imagine a body shaped like this but with

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:50.040
thinner legs, thin, weak muscles, a puffier

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.510
face, poor eyesight and a higher than
usual proclivity to dementia later

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.880
in life.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.550
Doesn't sound very good, does it?
Remember though that a lot of this

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:03.529
is speculation.
Few studies have been done on the topic

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:08.019
and few are planned for the future.
We don't even know if a healthy fetus can

00:11:08.019 --> 00:11:09.579
develop in the first place

00:11:09.579 --> 00:11:13.160
or if conception can even occur in space.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.670
When I think about how little we know
about our bodies

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:20.399
and how our bodies might grow and
develop in the larger

00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:24.490
universe beyond earth, I like to think about

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:28.079
plankton.
These little guys live in the ocean

00:11:28.079 --> 00:11:31.230
and they exist in staggering numbers.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:35.100
Many varieties are too small to even see individually,

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:39.160
but collectively they can be seen from space.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.440
It's estimated that there are more
plankton in the oceans of Earth

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.130
than there are stars in our galaxy.
More plankton on

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:51.040
Earth than there are galaxies in the observable

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.089
universe.
And these guys

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:58.029
wonder around at the whim of ocean currents.

00:11:58.029 --> 00:12:02.630
They're wanderers. In fact, they get their
name from the Greek word for

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.790
wanderer, a name that they share with objects

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:10.149
seen wondering in the sky.
Planets.

00:12:10.149 --> 00:12:13.620
Plankton on a planet.
Wanderers

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.920
on a wanderer.
Maybe,

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:21.899
like ocean plankton, we humans are
destined to wander far and wide

00:12:21.899 --> 00:12:26.019
eventually also becoming more numerous than the stars

00:12:26.019 --> 00:12:29.889
in our galaxy.
It's within the realm of what we can achieve.

00:12:29.889 --> 00:12:33.570
But before we start feeling too excited, too proud,

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:36.990
keep in mind that we know very little

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:40.190
about how our bodies grow and develop

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:44.100
outside of this wanderer, this planet.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.639
And even though we know a lot of older

00:12:47.639 --> 00:12:51.470
words that sound like body,

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:56.540
fundamentally we don't even know why we
call these things

00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:00.120
bodies in the first place.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.529
And as always, thanks for watching.
