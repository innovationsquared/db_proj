00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.139
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
Text.

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:07.370
The printed word.
Vitally important,

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.840
but never naked.
When

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.420
words and letters are printed,
they have to wear the

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.640
clothing of a typeface. A font family.
We don't always think of it this way, but

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.609
you cannot

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.090
type without using a typeface.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.970
Even right now, here on YouTube,
when you leave a comment,

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.789
you are communicating your own words,
your own thoughts,

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.969
but through the visual styling of someone

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.980
else - the creator up Arial.
In these Vsauce videos,

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.390
Jake, Kevin, myself and others use Alsina,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.700
because it most closely resembles the handwritingof

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.120
Nik Guinta, the creator of the Vsauce

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.199
logo. Now, thinking of typefaces

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.640
as fashion for letters is not a new idea.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.949
Adrian Frutiger famously said
that the work of a type designer

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.689
is just like the work of dressmaker.
Or

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.090
as Alan Fletcher put it, a typeface is an

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.350
alphabet in in a straitjacket.
Some typefaces have serifs

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.780
and some don't.
Some are famously neutral,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.390
while others are silly or ugly.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.939
But one typeface is

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.189
so silly and so ugly

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.340
and so popular that it has

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.600
arguably become the most hated font

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.740
of all time. Comic Sans.
People who consider themselves

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.759
discerning designers scoff at its ubiquity,

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.899
usually wielded by amatures who

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.229
don't know better.
It was recently reported that

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.310
on Twitter, the only thing complained
about more often than Justin Bieber,

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.380
but less frequently than airlines, is

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.119
Comic Sans.
Online you can play

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.399
a Kill Comic Sans game.
And the website

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.710
Ban Comic Sans provides a gigantic

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.810
list of hand-written looking fonts
that they would prefer you use

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.360
instead.
Comic Sans is so hated

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.750
it's almost pulled a 360 and is

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.950
cool again, ironically.
David OReilly's amazing t-shirts, for example.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.060
But irony isn't the only thing

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.910
Comic Sans has going for it.
The British Dyslexia Association considers

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.019
Comic Sans

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.319
a particularly good font for children
who have trouble reading letters because

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.739
of its easily distinguishable

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.560
characters, like the letter A.
For most of our history

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.610
books and signs had to be hand

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.750
written, often meticulously and expensively copied

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.810
by hand.
There were no printers, no typesetters.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.909
If you wanted a book, someone had to

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.450
literally write by hand the whole book for you.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.870
But Gutenberg changed that by popularizing

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.280
interchangeable type.
He modelled his tight pieces after the

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.110
handwriting of scribes at the time,
producing what could be called

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.580
the very first font ever textura.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.220
Later on, typesetters in Italy realized
that words could be

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.220
slanted and remain legible and readable,

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.860
but take up less vertical space,
so more could be printed on a single

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.549
page.
That's why it's called italics. Not because

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.739
italics means slanted or oblique, 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.530
but because of where it was invented - Italy.
Metal type

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.849
pieces had to be cast from molten metal

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.239
in foundries, which get their name from the French

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.849
fondue, which means something that has been melted.

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.470
And so it's because of the word fondue that
we now call a collection of characters

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.909
within a typeface

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.080
a font.
When setting type,

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.500
typesetters kept their type pieces in cases.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.220
The most commonly used pieces were kept
in the lower case for easy access,

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.420
whereas capitals were kept just a little above

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.819
in the upper case.
Back

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.759
to Comic Sans.
Comic Sans was designed in 1994

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.970
by Vincent Connare.
According to the BBC,

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.770
Melinda Gates herself asked Connare to design

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.800
a font for the cartoon dog in Microsoft Bob

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.340
to speak in.
And so, within three days,

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.050
Connare had designed Comic Sans,
based on hand drawn fonts

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.110
from comic books.
It never actually made it into the final version of

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.800
Microsoft Bob,

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.570
but was subsequently released as a font
choice on so many Microsoft products

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.690
that it became what it is today.
Million of amateurs now had access to this font,

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.020
which seemed simple and cute and became
popular on things like homemade birthday

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.870
cards,

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.620
but also in less appropriate situations.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.759
For instance, on an official Canadian coin

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.900
or on a gravestone.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.130
Because of things like that, Comic Sans has amassed

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.759
a lot of haters.
But it was never intended to be used

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:22.530
so often or in such inappropriate situations.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.460
And so in reality, the fault may lie

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.830
with us, the typers.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.860
Comic Sans doesn't disappoint people.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.220
People disappoint people.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.580
Another way to think of it is this.
Discerning type aficionados

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.229
may recognize Comic Sans so quickly because

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.380
it is a threat.
Type design

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.780
is a specialized discipline, but now

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.169
anybody with a computer can take a stab at it

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.810
without your approval.
They don't need

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.720
you.
To be sure, Comic Sans, objectively speaking,

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.300
isn't really that well designed
according to the fundamentals of type

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.280
design.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.030
David Kadavy has a brilliant
explanation of this in his

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.000
"Why You Hate Comic Sans."
He points out that it's

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.039
unbalanced and not very well kerned.

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:22.520
Comic Sans is certainly not a calculated, precise

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.819
font liked Trajan.
But it's not organic, like

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:29.800
real handwriting.
Instead, it lies within

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.440
the uncanny valley.
This concept often comes up in robotics.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.520
The more human something gets,
the cuter it becomes and

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.419
the more we like it,
until its almost human

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:47.080
but not quite.
At this point, things become

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.490
creepy, almost scary.
Perhaps Comic Sans

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.139
exists in that same area, typographically speaking.

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:01.360
But that said, the screens that Comic Sans
was originally designed to appear

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.889
on,

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:05.979
were typically aliased, and as Kadavy
points out, compared to fonts like

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:07.160
Garamond,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.449
Comic Sans does really well here.

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:14.139
That is how we should think about Comic Sans.

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:18.490
A pragmatic font, a font that worked
remarkably well in its

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.639
era and exists today as one of the most
recognizable

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:26.759
relics of one of the most important
design revolutions

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:31.289
in history.
Books used to be painstakingly copied by

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:35.889
hand.
Now later, you could design a story or an idea,

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:39.500
but the final look really just came down to what a

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.949
few typesetters could do.
Today,

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:46.680
almost anyone can dabble in typography

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.190
and that is an amazing thing.
Sure,

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:54.280
it means that Comic Sans will be used.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.490
A lot.
But as Corey Holms points out, Comic Dans

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:01.979
is proof the design works.
The public understands that

00:08:01.979 --> 00:08:05.990
"type means more than words."

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.620
And David Kadavy argues that just as
interchangeable type

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.340
led to a spread of literacy, Comic Sans,

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.389
and the personal publishing it comes along with,

00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:20.090
should lead us toward a spread of design

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:22.530
literacy.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.530
Sure.
Comic Sans is a bit

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:30.000
ugly.
But it's ugly in the same way that the first few chords

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.410
of 'Smoke on the Water' are ugly, as

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:37.220
played by almost every beginning guitarist,

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.310
who picks up a guitar at almost every

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:43.870
instrument store.
Sure, it sounds

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:49.090
annoying and a little bit fumbly, but it
represents someone who is using

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:52.930
tools to move toward mastery.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:58.140
Adrian Frutiger said that type
has the power to make the whole world of

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:58.870
thought

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.460
legible, simply by rearranging the same letters

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.800
over and over again.
Well, Comic Sans,

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.030
overused by the untrained majority

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.920
may seem unsavory to some people,
but as such,

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.070
it most loudly represents something phenomenal.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:21.830
Today it is possible for the whole world of

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.770
thought to be made legible and be shared

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.310
by the whole world.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.200
And as always,

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.820
thanks for watching.
