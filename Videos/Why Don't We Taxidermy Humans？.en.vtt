00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.649
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And when you die,

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:08.309
what happens to your body?
It can be buried

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.429
or cremated or donated to science,

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.000
but are those your only options?
I mean,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.720
what if I wanted to be taxidermied, like my friend here?

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.220
What if I requested to have my body
stuffed and mounted in some hilarious

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.220
position, like

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.539
a permanent high five, so people could high five

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.769
my actual skin forever?

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.559
Well, it turns out to be quite complicated.

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.110
So let's begin with an easier and more flexible solution.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.910
Cremation and ashes.
Twelve

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.200
humans have walked on the Moon.
But

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.899
300 humans have been buried in outer space.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.960
With the right connections and budget
you can have a portion of your

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.100
ashes launched into space.
The very first space burial

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.340
occurred in 1997, when a rocket deposited the ashes

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.610
of 24 people into orbit around Earth.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.850
In 1999, human remains were first

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.689
buried on the Moon.
A lunar prospector probe dropped some scientific

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:15.470
instruments

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.110
and some of the cremated
remains of Eugene Shoemaker,

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.350
co-discoverer of the comet Shoemakerâ€“Levy 9.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.000
But the first human to have their remains

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.020
leave our solar system will be

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.640
Clyde Tombaugh, the guy who discovered Pluto.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.299
In 2006, some of his ashes were launched
aboard the New Horizons probe,

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.500
which will arrive near Pluto in 2015,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.979
take some recordings and pictures and
then continue on

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.130
beyond our solar system.
You don't need to get all

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.939
outer spacey to have fun with you ashes.
Right here on earth

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.759
there are companies that will take carbon
from your remains and expose them to

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.619
extreme heat and pressure

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.799
long enough that you wind up with a diamond

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.610
made out of you. It can be cut and
polished. One woman even had it done with

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.820
the

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.450
ashes of "Meowy," her cat.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.830
The point here is that you can be quite creative

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.580
with cremated remains.
But ashes don't

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.230
look like you did when you were alive, so let's revisit

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.150
taxidermy. The shapes and combinations
that animals have been taxidermied into

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.319
are quite creative.
For instance, an actual

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.849
pig turned into an actual piggy bank.

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.300
A bird light fixture.
A goat

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.999
that's also a bagpipe.

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:42.819
Doves turned into

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.569
shoes.
And, of course, the guy who taxidermied his

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.889
cat into a remote-controlled quadcopter.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.700
Taxidermy doesn't preserve

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.099
every part of your body.
It is taxi

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.760
dermy - the arrangement of skin,

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.500
which is okay.
I mean, taxidermy won't bother to preserve

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.750
all of your internal organs, but your skin

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.730
is your largest organ.
Your skin comprises anywhere from 12 to 15 percent

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.189
of your total body weight plus it's an
organ that people

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:23.299
see and recognize you by.
But here's one of the problems.

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.669
When animals are taxidermied,
their skin is removed and then mounted

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:32.819
on a mannequin.
A shape that resembles the animal,

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.489
but is made of wood or wall and wire or foam.

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.099
That's fine for museums.
But the use of a generic

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.040
mannequin can lead to an animal that looks generic.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.629
All of the tiny, subtle, but very important
features of the animals'

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.290
cartilage, fat, muscles are more difficult to recreate

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.569
after it's dead and all you have is its skin.

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.609
That's why many taxidermists hesitate

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.079
to taxidermy a person's beloved pet.

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.409
Because in order to satisfy the client,
an immense amount of specificity is

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:09.199
required.

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.540
Even more so if you were trying to recreate a person.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.320
So, taxidermy may not be the best way to
preserve yourself

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.300
or your daddy or your mummy...
Mummies.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.460
What about them?
Well, let's go back to the 19th century

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.570
and Jeremy Bentham. When he died, the
philosopher requested that his body be

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.199
mummified as best as technology would allow
and his body dressed up in clothes

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.440
and displayed at the University College
of London. It periodically still

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.210
is, but the mummification didn't turn
out perfectl, so he's really just

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.849
a skeleton dressed up in clothes and stuffed.

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:52.770
The head wound up looking a bit too
wrinkled and the color was off

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.060
and so a wax head was made.
You can check out a 3D photograph

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.770
of Jeremy Bentham online.
And who could forget

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.699
the dried out mummified middle finger of Galileo?

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:08.639
We still have it and it's on display in Florence.

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.449
It's a great thing to visit if you want
a pivotal historical figure

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.320
to flip you off.
But we're looking for a way to preserve ourselves

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.490
realistically, as we appear while living.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.539
So, let's take a look at embalming.
Not

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.120
all corpses are embalmed before they're
buried, but embalming

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.380
is a great technique for preserving a body,

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.839
slowing down decomposition,
so it can stay above ground and

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:36.900
be displayed a little bit longer.
Now, if

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.270
a body is embalmed really really well
it can be preserved

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.070
longer than you might think.
Abraham Lincoln was embalmed so well

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.409
that even though his coffin has been moved 17 times

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:54.529
since he was buried and the casket opened five times,

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:58.550
on each of those occasions,
including the most recent in 1901,

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.039
people said "yeah, still looks like Lincoln."

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.560
On an even more extreme scale are the
bodies of people like Mao

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.560
and Lenin, which continue to be on display

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.500
to this day. The bodies require special
treatments multiple times a week.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.150
The exact techniques and embalming fluids
used to preserve Lenin

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.849
are kept secret, 
but they've kept him preserved for more than

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:27.820
80 years.
Well embalmed bodies can be displayed

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.880
before being buried in more positions than just

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.009
lying down in a coffin.
For instance, leaned up against a wall

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:38.080
or riding a motorcycle.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.800
Wow.
But embalming

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.710
doesn't last for ever,
and if you try to make it last forever

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.349
be prepared to spend a lot of money and time.

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:54.630
One method that could be used on humans
and has become popular with pets

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.589
is similar to instant coffee.
Freeze-drying.

00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:01.630
The process involves freezing the animal,

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:06.269
so that all of its water solidifies.
And then using a partial vacuum with the

00:07:06.269 --> 00:07:08.089
pressure so low

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:11.669
that the solid water instantly turns into vapor

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:15.409
and escapes away, leaving a much much lighter

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:18.529
freeze-dried pet.

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:22.450
Unfortunately, when it comes to preserving a human

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.380
body, as realistically as possible after death,

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.760
these methods - freeze-drying, mummification,

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.180
taxidermy, long-term embalming are either

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.360
unsatisfactory or impractical.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.680
With the exception possibly of a slightly newer method -

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.450
plastination.
It's the method used to prepare bodies for exhibits

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:51.269
like Body Worlds.
Essentially plastination involves a specimen

00:07:51.269 --> 00:07:55.060
soaked in a volatile solvent and then placed in a

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.950
polymer solution.
In a low-pressure environment

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:02.190
the volatile solvent leaves the specimen and

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.779
the empty space is filled with the polymer solution.

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:09.089
The specimen is flexible and can be put into a pose

00:08:09.089 --> 00:08:12.769
and then the polymer hardened by using special gases.

00:08:12.769 --> 00:08:17.260
Human bodies that have been plastinated
last a very long time,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.459
even at room temperature.
But here's the crazy thing.

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:25.310
It's free.
You can quite easily donate your body

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:30.440
to the Institute for Plastination.
It counts as donating your body to science.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.979
But here's the thing: you won't necessarily have control

00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:37.039
over what's done with your body,

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:41.139
because at the end of the day corpses are legally

00:08:41.139 --> 00:08:44.209
not property.
No one owns

00:08:44.209 --> 00:08:47.459
a corpse.
Because a corpse

00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:51.060
is not legally a piece of property,
no one can just

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.570
do whatever they want with it.
Your options are severely

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:58.450
limited and even if you you specifically have requested,

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:03.630
say, that your body be taxidermied and
all of your surviving can agree and

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.310
want it to happen,

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:09.680
it's very unlikely that a mortuary would
allow that to happen,

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.320
and, historically, the law sides

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.610
with the mortuary.
For example,

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:20.850
in 1994, David Eugene Russell
requested that when he died

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.709
his body be skinned,
his skin tanned in the leather

00:09:24.709 --> 00:09:28.839
and that leather used to bind a book of his writings.

00:09:28.839 --> 00:09:32.149
He wanted this to happen, as did his surviving widow.

00:09:32.149 --> 00:09:36.420
But the mortuary refused to do it and
the court sided with the mortuary. So,

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.980
even if you have a really cool idea for
how your body could be

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.769
embalmed forever and displayed in a funny, weird or

00:09:43.769 --> 00:09:49.029
bizarre way, you're not going to get permission to do so.

00:09:49.029 --> 00:09:53.399
Plastination winds up being one of
your only options, but you won't have a

00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:54.570
lot of control over

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.089
what happens to you once plastinated.

00:09:58.089 --> 00:10:02.010
But hold on a second.
In 1998,

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:06.529
Anthony-Noel Kelly was arrested for
stealing anatomical specimens from the

00:10:06.529 --> 00:10:07.730
Royal College

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:11.740
of Surgeons.
Now, he claimed that he was not guilty of theft,

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:15.120
because a corpse is not a piece of property.
He was merely guilty

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.820
of the mistreatment of a corpse.
But the judge ruled

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.820
that because these anatomical specimens
had been especially prepared by

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.760
licensed and skilled workers at the college,

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:31.630
they had become property.
So here's something really strange.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:35.080
If you found a way to get your body taxidermied,

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.170
for the benefit of medical science,

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.110
in doing so you may actually become

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:44.279
a piece of ownable property.
So, in a way,

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:47.709
bean taxidermied may be the best way

00:10:47.709 --> 00:10:51.009
to allow your survivors, your loved ones, to

00:10:51.009 --> 00:10:55.379
legally and literally have you forever.

00:10:55.379 --> 00:10:56.239
And as always,

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:57.259
thanks for watching.
