00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.860
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
Gregory W. Nemitz

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.470
registered some land containing 492

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.980
quintillion dollars worth of platinum.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.360
The land was right here... well,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.869
over here - an asteroid

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.240
named 433 Eros.
Not a single sovereign nation on earth

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.080
recognizes human claims to
extraterrestrial real estate,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.800
but he did it anyway.
And then, less than a year later,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.180
NASA landed a probe on the asteroid.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.960
They called it the first asteroid
we had ever landed a probe on.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.680
Nemitz called it "parking space number 29"
and promptly sent

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.030
NASA a 20 dollar parking ticket.
But so far,

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.110
NASA and the US Attorney General 
have dismissed the fine, saying that

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.920
his claim to own the asteroid is without legal merit.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.500
But why?

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.310
Plenty of organizations exists that will
gladly take your money in return for

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.330
land on the Moon, Venus, Mars.
And if you had enough money to go to the Moon,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.030
nothing is legally stopping you from moving there,

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.610
building a house with a significant
other, having some kids and turning

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.000
your Moon house

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.090
into a Moon home.
It wouldn't be trespassing

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.310
or squatting or stealing.
The 1979 Moon Treaty

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.229
says that no one can own any part of outer space

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.310
ever, but only 11 states have signed it.
However,

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.340
129 nations have signed and/or ratified the 1967

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.869
Outer Space Treaty, which says that outer
space is not subject to national

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.479
appropriation.
It says nothing about a private individual

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.190
or a company owning part of outer space.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.220
But without the recognition and support
of at least one sovereign nation,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.490
what does ownership really mean?

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.630
I mean, I can claim anything I want.
I can claim to own Prospect Park

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.290
in Brooklyn, but just saying that I do or
even moving there

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.000
and living in Prospect Park wouldn't
entitle me to the rights that usually go

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.250
along with ownership,

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.720
unless someone with a bunch of power

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.709
agreed that I owned it and could enforce
that ownership and keep others

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.050
from claiming to also own it.
In the past,

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.400
explorers had few qualms about claiming to

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.550
own land,

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.140
even if other humans were already there,
because they had

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.700
power on their side - mainly plenty of guns,

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.760
Germs and Steel.
To paraphrase con artist

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.010
Canada Bill Jones, "you know what beats four aces?

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.440
A gun."
Or as @lawblob pointed out,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.489
McDonald's actually does serve
breakfast after 10:30,

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:08.640
if you have a gun. If you claimed some
land on the Moon as your own and moved in,

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.950
would you also have to hire your own lunar police

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.209
and Cislunar military to defend it and
to keep others from

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.970
challenging your claim?
Pretty much.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.370
That's kind of the problem.
Currently it is

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.920
risky for individuals or corporations to claim

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.410
and use extraterrestrial territory
because the Outer Space Treaty

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.739
says that outer space is the common

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.910
heritage of mankind.
It belongs

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.110
to all of us

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.270
and only to all of us.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.819
Many interpretations of the Outer Space
Treaty predict that powerful things like

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:49.640
nations

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.470
would be reluctant to come to your
defense should someone else want to move in

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.830
or cause trouble

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.880
or dispute your extraterrestrial claim.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.620
Maybe you could get the sovereign nation
to weigh in on your behalf by declaring

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.489
universal jurisdiction

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.720
but that would need to be for an
incredibly terrible heinous crime, a

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.870
crime against all of humanity, not just

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.130
a dispute over a few space rocks.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.730
Catherine Doldirina from the
Institute of Air &amp; Space Law at

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.780
McGill University suggests

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.810
that considering outer space, the common heritage of

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.830
mankind, has slowed space exploration.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.080
You see, the Outer Space Treaty was based
on the Antarctic Treaty, which says that

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.460
the entire continent

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.410
shall never become the scene or object
of international discord.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.979
Discord is not a good thing, but
without an incentive to profit from it,

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.910
not much has happened there,
as opposed to the

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.590
Arctic, where a resource boom is
currently underway.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.280
If people felt safer appropriating and
taking advantage of space, of celestial

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.040
bodies,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.780
if technological development was more incentivized,

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.640
would we already have orbiting tourist attractions

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.250
and lunar hotels?
Maybe.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.430
But here is what you can currently own

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.460
in outer space: stuff you put there

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.750
and, to a certain extent, orbits.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.950
The Outer Space Treaty says that the
stuff we left on the move,

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.330
anything put into space, remains property

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.220
of the original owner forever.
Orbits around

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.790
earth are temporarily granted by the
International Telecommunication Union,

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.890
a UN agency;
but they don't work like typical real estate

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.320
on Earth.
When a group of Equatorial nations

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.690
attempted to claim orbits above their
land boundaries, without planning on

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.160
putting satellites there,

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.230
their claim was largely ignored.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.830
So you not only need to ask the UN for an orbit

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.120
and get permission,
you also need to use it and fill it.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.310
It's a little disappointing that we
don't know how

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.100
lunar real estate works or if it will,

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.370
but it's exciting to know that we,
within our lifetimes,

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.610
might have a chance to be part of the solution.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.440
A unique generation not visiting space
for the first time,

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.530
but homesteading it for the first time.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.880
Here's another unresolved space law quandary.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.360
If an alien landed in your backyard,

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.510
intelligent life from beyond Earth, and you shot it

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:39.200
with a gun, dressed it and then cooked up,
you and your family, some alien meat

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.790
fajitas, would that be

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.530
hunting or murder?

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.949
We literally don't know.
On earth, we have human rights,

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:55.080
but there are no alien rights.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.180
Maybe it would fall under the category of

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:02.699
cultural vandalism, an act that's not necessarily

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:05.740
a legal, but is a giant bummer

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.800
to the rest of humanity.
This has happened before -

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.080
not with aliens - but with paintings.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.699
In 2003, the Chapman brothers purchased
one of the few remaining sets of

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:20.300
Goya's Fantastic Disasters of War.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.729
Instead of displaying the works for the
public, they defaced them

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:28.159
by drawing clown and puppy heads on the people.

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:31.909
They called the work "insult to injury."

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:36.310
In protest, a man threw red paint on
Jake Chapman when he appeared at Modern Art

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.009
Oxford,

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:40.680
but at the end of the day,
what the Chapman brothers did

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.379
wasn't illegal.
They owned the paintings.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.440
Vandalizing the Moon or

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:51.020
killing a peaceful alien aren't illegal

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:56.300
acts, but just like defacing historical
paintings, they seem wrong on some

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.440
deeper level, especially since because in
most museums

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.620
you usually can't even touch the paintings.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.520
But who was the first person

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:11.699
to touch the Moon with their bare hands?

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:16.620
I mean, the guys who walked around on the
Moon wore space suits, they had material

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.100
in between their skin

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.310
and the Moon.
Well, to be sure,

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.910
you already have the Moon in your hands.

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:28.180
Well, little Moons.
Lunula.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.900
The crescent-shaped area at the base of
your fingernail,

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.080
where tissue is thicker and the red
vascular structures underneath are more

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:35.700
hidden,

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:40.360
making it white.
And to be even more sure,

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:45.530
at the quantum level touch is
problematic. As I've covered before,

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:49.660
atomically speaking, matter never really contacts

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.720
other matter in the conventional sense.
You can't

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.840
truly touch anything.
MinutePhysics called it

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.270
interaction over a short distance.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.380
With that in mind, NASA says the

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:06.140
Terry Slezak was the first person to
touch the Moon

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.740
with his bare hands. He was a technician
in quarantine, who accidentally got lunar

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.200
soil smeared

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.350
all over his hand while removing film magazines

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:20.400
from the astronauts' cameras.
But when Armstrong and Aldrin returned to the

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.350
lunar module

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:26.240
after their moonwalk and removed their
helmets, they came into contact with

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.090
lunar dust

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.570
they tracked in on their suits.
They even reported its

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.880
odor, saying it smelled of spent gunpowder

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.090
or ashes, possibly because it oxidized

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:41.950
on contact with the air in the cabin.
Point is,

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.070
the first few breaths of Moon dusty

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:49.000
air that Armstrong and Aldrin took in were our first

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.100
fleshly contact with the Moon.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.010
Or were they?
Walking around on earth

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:59.389
every day I am surrounded by material that recently

00:09:59.389 --> 00:10:05.120
was in outer space. Hundreds of metric
tons of extraterrestrial rock falls to

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.810
Earth every year.
Some from the Moon, but most from asteroids,

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.290
ejected by a high-speed impact and
eventually caught by

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.639
Earth's gravity.
Some pieces are big enough to see,

00:10:16.639 --> 00:10:21.690
but most are pulverized by our atmosphere
during entry into tiny particles that

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:22.519
disperse

00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:25.899
in the air, becoming a tiny fraction of the very

00:10:25.899 --> 00:10:29.899
dust and dirt we clean up and breathe in every day.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.160
There's microscopic space dust,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.630
pieces of asteroids and even the Moon all around us.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.550
In fact, there might be microscopic
pieces of the Moon

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:43.240
under your bed right now or even

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:48.680
under your fingernails. Which means the
first human to have fleshly contact

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.980
with lunar material

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.889
was the first Homo Sapien hundreds of
thousands of years ago

00:10:53.889 --> 00:11:00.069
to walk on dirt. We are still studying
exactly how much cosmic dust is in the

00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:01.740
air that we breathe every day,

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:05.660
but it's safe to say that every once in
a while you inhale some

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.870
material that was recently in

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:13.380
outer space, some of which thousands of
years ago was on the Moon.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:18.690
Was the Moon. And just like other
particulates in our atmosphere,

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:22.149
large enough pieces get trapped in the
mucus that protects

00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:26.380
our lungs, meaning that picking your nose is gross,

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.610
but every once in a while,
a booger could literally

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.570
be out of this world.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.139
And as always,

00:11:33.139 --> 00:11:34.950
thanks for watching.
