00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:07.669
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And today we are
going to go inside a black hole. It's not

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:13.209
going to be comfortable, but it will be pretty
fun. Now, first thing's first: mathematically

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:19.060
speaking, anything could become a black hole,
if you were to compress it into a small enough

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.840
space. That's right, you, me, this camera -
everything in the unvierse has what is known

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.960
as a "Schwarzschild radius." A tiny, tiny amount
of space that, were you to collapse the entire

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.250
mass of the object into, its density would
be so great that its gravitational pull would

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.120
be so great that not even light could escape
from it. You would have a black hole.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.280
If you were to compress Mount Everest into
something smaller than a nanometer, you would

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.270
have a black hole. And if you were to compress
the entire Earth down to the size of a peanut,

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.780
you would have a black hole.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.530
But, fortunately for us, there is no known
way to compress Everest or Earth in that fashion.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.859
But a star, many, many, many times larger
than our own Sun, has a much larger Schwartzchild

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:15.570
radius, and when it runs out of fuel and can
no longer keep itself hot enough, it collapses

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.880
to a single, infinitesimally-small point known
as a "singularity."

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.469
Its density will be infinite and so its
gravitational pull will be so strong that

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.079
nothing can escape, not even light.

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.840
But enough about ways black holes form, let's
jump into one. First question: what would

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.840
it look like from the outside? Well, we know
that gravitational fields bend space and time.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.840
Stars behind our Sun will actually appear
to be in slightly different locations from

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.460
Earth, because the Sun's gravitational field
bends the light coming from those stars.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.579
When it comes to the gravitational fields
of larger objects, like entire galaxies or,

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:02.549
for that matter, a black hole, the effect
is even nuttier. Light coming from object's

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.850
behind them is significantly distorted,
producing smears and smudges.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.970
As seen from Earth, the blue galaxy behind
this red galaxy is completely distorted, like

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.300
a fun house mirror. So, rather than appearing
as it really should, it looks to us like a ring -

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.420
a smudge all the way around the red galaxy.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.240
This is known as "gravitational lensing."
Now, take a look at this simulation of a black

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.200
hole with a galaxy millions of lightyears
behind it. The galaxy's really not in danger

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:39.190
of the black hole's "suck," but the light
coming off of that galaxy certainly is. Watch

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.550
as the galaxy passes behind the black hole
and its light is contorted, twisted and

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.280
distorted.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.640
Now here's a really fun demonstration.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.680
What if the Earth were to orbit around a black
hole? Looking from the outside, the Earth

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.910
would look normal at first, but as soon as
it passed behind the black hole, the black

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.900
hole's gravitational field would warp the
light reflecting off the Earth, producing

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.200
this.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.880
For the sake of simplicity, let's jump into
a simple black hole, one that doesn't have

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.640
a charge and isn't moving. And, also, isn't
already sucking up a bunch of matter. So it's

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.560
just there on its own.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.440
As we approach, the distortion of the sky
grows greater and greater. A larger and larger

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.250
portion of our field of view looking forward
into the black hole will be filled with darkness.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.680
At this point, where half of our field of
view has been swallowed up in darkness, we

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.260
have reached the "Photon Sphere."

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.360
At this point, light is not going to necessarily
get sucked into the black hole, but it doesn't

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.620
necessarily leave it either. Instead, at this
magical point in space, light, photons, can

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.480
actually orbit the black hole.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.560
If you were to stop here for a moment and
look to the side, you could theoretically

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.590
see the back of your own head, because light
reflecting off the back of your head would

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.880
travel all the way around the sphere of the
black hole, right back to your face.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:10.650
A gravitational field not only warps space,
it also warps time. Now, for most intensive

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.190
purposes here on Earth, we never have to worry
about that. But near a black hole, gravity

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.919
would be so strong that an observer standing,
watching you jump into the hole, would see

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:25.370
something quite strange. They wouldn't see
you get sucked quickly into the hole. Instead,

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.509
they would see your approach become slower,
and slower, and slower, until you reached

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:35.009
a point known as the event-horizon.

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:41.319
This is a point in space where, once crossed,
there's no going back. It is at that point

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:46.569
that light can no longer escape. And, so,
to a person watching you fall into the hole,

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:51.740
that would be where your journey ended. You
would seem almost frozen in space, the light

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:58.280
coming off your body becoming increasingly
red-shifted until you simply faded into nothingness.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.420
They would never see you cross the event-horizon.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.500
But for you, of course, everything would seem
fine and dandy. You would continue pass

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.440
that horizon to your now, inevitable, death.
As you continue to approach the black hole's

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.389
singularity, your view of the entire universe
would get compressed into a smaller and smaller

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.310
point in space behind you.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.969
If the black hole we're jumping into was large
enough, things actually might be quite comfortable

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:27.360
at that event horizon. We'll know that we're
never going to escape and that our lives are

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.919
pretty much over, but it might take us hours
to actually reach a point where things started

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.060
to hurt.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.389
Why would they hurt? Well, the closer you get
to the singularity, the more significant the

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:42.560
difference in gravitational pull is across
space. And, so, parts of me that are closer

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.370
to the singularity would be pulled more strongly
than parts that were facing away and my entire

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:54.370
body would be stretched toward the singularity.
The effect would be so incredible, scientists

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.890
don't usually call it stretching, they call
it "Spaghettification."

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:04.050
Once you reach this point, you would be dead.
Your molecules would be violently ripped and

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.650
stretched apart, and when they got to the
singularity, well, we don't really know what

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.199
would happen. Perhaps they would completely
disappear in violation of all the laws of

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:19.110
physics or maybe they would reappear elsewhere
in the universe. It is believed that a moving

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.770
or spinning black hole might actually create
what is known as a "wormhole," a way of transitioning

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.120
across space faster than light. Not in any
way that violates the laws of science, but

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.319
in a way that takes advantage of the universe's
dimensions.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.960
For instance, if I wanted to get from this
point to this point, I'd have to travel the

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:45.960
distance. But, theoretically, a wormhole would
do something really crazy. For instance, this.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.759
Now, the two points are right next to each
other and I can travel between them almost

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:51.199
instantaneously.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:56.640
But, again, this is all theoretical. Luckily,
we do have a possible way of analyzing black

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.780
holes right here on Earth. Enter the "Dumbhole."

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:07.980
Just as a black hole does not permit light
to escape, a Dumbhole is an acoustic black

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:14.879
hole. It won't allow sound to escape. It doesn't
have to be nearly as powerful and scientists

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:20.969
have been able to create Dumbholes in laboratories
using special fluids traveling at the speed

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:21.580
of sound.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.180
A lot of progress still needs to be made in
the world of acoustic black holes, but we

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.849
may be able to learn an amazing amount of
information about how black holes work by

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:33.569
looking at how sound is treated in a Dumbhole.

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:39.279
Now here's another good question: What would
it look like to travel at the speed of light,

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:44.339
say, toward the Sun? Well, surprisingly, you
wouldn't just see the Sun immediately rush

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:50.919
up toward you. No, no, no. In fact, initially,
it would look almost as if the Sun were receding

00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:57.379
away from you. Why? Because your field of
view would vastly increase in size. You would

00:07:57.379 --> 00:08:01.339
be able to see stuff almost behind you. 
And here's why.

00:08:01.339 --> 00:08:05.789
As you sit there, not moving yet, looking
at the Sun, there's light coming from stuff

00:08:05.789 --> 00:08:11.509
behind you. But, if you travel the speed of
light, you will actually reach that light

00:08:11.509 --> 00:08:16.599
coming from things behind you. As you reached
light speed, your field of view would expand

00:08:16.599 --> 00:08:19.650
like this, concentrating the stuff in the
middle.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:26.599
But where are you in the universe? Or, here's
a better question. Where is the center of

00:08:26.599 --> 00:08:32.440
the universe? Well, this might sound crazy,
but it's everywhere. This is known as the

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:38.199
"Cosmological Principle." No matter where
you are in the universe, everything else will

00:08:38.199 --> 00:08:42.810
seem to be moving away from you, expanding,
at the same rate.

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:47.149
The universe is expanding, but not like a
balloon getting bigger with all the people

00:08:47.149 --> 00:08:52.699
inside it. Instead, it's as if we are the
surface of a balloon. If you were to put a

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:56.660
bunch of dots on a balloon and then blow it
up, all the dots would move away from each

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:01.720
other at the same rate. And, on the surface
of the balloon, there is no center.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.480
Take a look at these two layers. They are
exactly similar, except the top layer represents

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.680
a 5% expansion of the bottom layer.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:14.699
Let's say that you live on one of these dots,
and you want to measure where everything is

00:09:14.699 --> 00:09:20.889
moving away from. Well, watch what happens
when I line up a dot in the past and the present.

00:09:20.889 --> 00:09:29.519
Boom. It looks like the center of the expansion.
I can do this with any dot. As soon as I choose

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:35.430
a dot to be the frame of reference, it immediately
becomes the center of the expansion.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:41.759
So, while dying in a black hole would be lonely,
and scary, and morbid, when you look up into

00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:46.500
the sky think instead about this. No matter
where you are, or who you are, or what your

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:53.500
friends or your parents, you really,
scientifically, are the center of the universe.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:01.880
Finally, what if our universe was a googolplex
meters across? It is nowhere near that large.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:07.890
But, if it was, it would be so voluminous
that, statistically, it would be nearly impossible

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:14.620
for there not to be an exact copy of you somewhere
else out there in the universe. To see why,

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:19.750
I highly suggest that you click right there
and check out Brady Haran's new channel "Numberphile."

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:23.430
It's part of the YouTube original channel's,
and I've worked with these guys before. They're

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:27.750
amazing, they're my favorite kind of geeks.
So, check out that video, watch their other

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.930
stuff, and if you like math,
I highly suggest that you subscribe.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:31.980
And as always,

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.460
thanks for watching.
