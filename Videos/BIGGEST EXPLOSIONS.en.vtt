00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here,
and today I'm in my apartment.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.100
But when I was in Kansas with family
my dad lit off what is known as a quarter stick.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.076
But don't worry, absolutely no children were around.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.040
Okay, look, the point is that today we're going to talk about explosives.

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:26.069
Let's begin way down the scale with black powder,

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:28.842
or smokeless powder which many modern rounds use.

00:00:28.842 --> 00:00:31.768
Now, usually smokeless powder doesn't even detonate.

00:00:31.768 --> 00:00:34.308
Instead, it deflagrates.

00:00:34.308 --> 00:00:36.939
Technically, an explosion is only a detonation

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:41.439
when the material or the gases expelled travel faster than the speed of sound.

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:46.203
If the explosion is subsonic,
you're only dealing with a deflagration.

00:00:46.203 --> 00:00:50.403
Now, we want a bullet's propellant
to deflagrate, not detonate,

00:00:50.403 --> 00:00:53.600
because we want it to have enough power
to move the bullet quickly,

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.629
but not release its energy so fast
as to damage the gun or ourselves.

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.735
Take a look at some smokeless powder
lit in the open and slow motion.

00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:03.455
It burns very strongly and quickly,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.360
but at all times, the gasses it expels
never exceed the speed of sound

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.700
and no shock wave is produced. We're looking at deflegration here, not detonation.

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:15.146
To compare, this is nitroglycerin.

00:01:15.146 --> 00:01:18.486
It's so fragile, you hit it with a hammer and it detonates.

00:01:18.486 --> 00:01:24.700
Even at a slower speed, we can see that all the material immediately explodes.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.800
Consumer fireworks use black powder, gun powder,

00:01:28.808 --> 00:01:32.488
and as such, they don't have enough power to really ever be set to detonate.

00:01:32.488 --> 00:01:35.528
The same goes for that quarter stick
you saw my dad light off.

00:01:35.837 --> 00:01:38.137
Those and M80s and cherry bombs

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.040
are louder and often illegal, but they burn flash powder, not a high explosive light dynamite.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.380
But that doesn't mean fireworks can't be amazing.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.420
Currently, some of the largest
shells in use are 48 inches across.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.260
When exploded in the air, a 48 inch shell

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.840
looks like this.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.480
Or like this.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.280
Oh yeah, when they fail to launch and burst on the ground instead, it looks like this.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.540
But let's move on to detonations—no matter what material releases the energy—

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.174
whether it's a conventional explosive or a nuclear bomb or an asteroid impact or an earthquake,

00:02:31.174 --> 00:02:35.734
they are all commonly measured by saying how much TNT you would have to detonate

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.320
to get an equivalently strong explosion.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.060
To give you a sense of scale,
here is the detonation of approximately 100 tons

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.971
of TNT by a defense contractor disposing of explosives.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.000
Unlike deflegrations, detonations produce a shockwave,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.440
which is just that, a wave made of areas of high pressure and low pressure.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.600
This explosion was so powerful
the area of low pressure

00:03:05.601 --> 00:03:09.981
had such low pressure that water vapor in the air around it condensed momentarily,

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:12.221
which formed this cloud.

00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:16.941
And here's a video of an explosion where the shock wave is particularly visible

00:03:16.941 --> 00:03:19.541
as it approaches and hits the camera man.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.760
You can also see shock condensation
clouds around these explosions

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.060
set off by the United States in Hawaii in 1965.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.171
The US wanted to know nuclear attacks
would affect naval ships,

00:03:39.171 --> 00:03:42.191
so they detonated an equivalent amount of TNT

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.080
on an island with US ships anchored nearby.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.460
This pile contains 500 tons

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.760
of TNT waiting to explode.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.500
When it does, it looks like this.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.240
Earlier, the US tested actual nuclear weapons
to see how underwater detonations

00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:05.801
might affect our ships.

00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:09.200
This underwater nuclear explosion is much larger,

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:12.701
the equivalent of not 100 tons of TNT,

00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:17.303
not 500 tons, but 8,000 tons.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.640
For comparison, the atomic bomb
dropped on Hiroshima

00:04:23.642 --> 00:04:29.522
in 1945 exploded with the energy of 15,000 tons of TNT.

00:04:29.522 --> 00:04:34.060
The single most physically powerful device
ever used by humanity

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.030
was the Tsar Bomb.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.139
The Soviet Union tested it in 1961,

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.339
far up north away from civilization.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.000
It was detonated two and a half miles
above the surface of the earth

00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:49.745
to minimize its destruction, which
was unprecedented by man.

00:04:49.745 --> 00:04:52.305
The Tsar Bomb exploded with the power equivalent

00:04:52.305 --> 00:04:56.612
to 50 million tons of TNT.

00:05:05.241 --> 00:05:06.641
The mushroom cloud from the Tsar Bomb

00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:10.580
extended beyond our normal atmosphere
into the mesosphere

00:05:10.584 --> 00:05:13.977
and dwarfed the largest clouds from US detonations.

00:05:13.977 --> 00:05:16.547
It was so large that comparatively

00:05:16.547 --> 00:05:21.809
the bombs dropped on Japan, well,
they're on the graph way down there.

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:25.213
But at the end of the day,
nothing can beat supernovas,

00:05:25.213 --> 00:05:28.341
the explosion of an entire star.

00:05:28.341 --> 00:05:33.081
While 50 million tons may sound like a lot,
one supernova is estimated

00:05:33.081 --> 00:05:40.081
to give off the energy equivalent
of ten octillion million tons of TNT.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.400
I leave you with a cannon developed by
the US to shoot a normal little cannon ball,

00:05:45.403 --> 00:05:48.163
except that it carried a nuclear warhead.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.220
I'm pretty sure you can pick these up at
Bass Pro Shop, but regardless,

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.060
be sure you're subscribed to Vsauce

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.540
so you don't miss anything coming up,

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.980
And as always,

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.420
thanks for watching.
