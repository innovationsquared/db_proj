Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And today, we're going to talk about water.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.349
Because today is World Water Day.
A day about raising awareness of the fact

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.849
that, even though, here on Earth, there is
enough clean, safe, drinking water for everybody

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:21.650
to have enough, they don't.
In fact, a billion of them don't.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.109
But it doesn't have to be that way.
Now first, I wanna cover how water is not

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:32.340
just vital and amazing, but to this day, continues
to surprise us.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.430
For instance, the Mpemba effect.
The effect has been observed many many many

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.129
times, but has never been explained.
In fact, it is so famously anti-common sense,

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.649
whenever people throughout history have observed
it, they've tended to think that they just

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.170
did something wrong.
Which is why even though Aristotle himself

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.579
wrote about it, it wasn't until the 20th century
that it got its name.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.510
Simply put, the Mpemba effect is the observation
that under the right circumstances a glass

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.330
of boiling hot water inside a freezer can
turn to ice more quickly than a glass of cold

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.440
water.
It doesn't make a lot of sense, but it can

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.730
happen.
A few possible causes have been thrown out.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.020
For instance, if you heat up or boil water,
you remove some of the dissolved gas.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.690
And having less stuff dissolved in it may
be what makes hot water easier to freeze.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.720
It's the opposite of why we throw down salt
during wintery weather.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.480
The salt dissolves into the water, putting
more stuff in it, making it more difficult

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.970
to freeze.
But does that account for the entire effect?

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.150
Well, some other possible explanations involve
convection currents.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.290
A glass of warm water will contain more cycling
convection currents, meaning that the top

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.040
of that glass of water is warmer.
And a glass of warm water will tend to freeze

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.470
from the sides in, whereas the glass of cold
water will tend to freeze all across the top

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.040
down.
But once that top layer is frozen, it acts

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.150
as an insulator, so all the water below it
freezes more slowly.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.640
The point is that we still do not have a complete
explanation of the effect.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.950
Part of the problem is how difficult it is
to control every single variable.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.150
Should we be using equal masses of water or
equal volumes?

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.319
Should they be in the same freezer or in separate
freezers?

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.849
And what about evaporation?
The warm water will be evaporating faster

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.299
and evaporations into thermosis, it's losing
heat more quickly than the cold water.

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.620
It's tough.
But here's what we do know.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.999
Earth has a lot of water.
70% of Earth's surface is covered in it.

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:47.209
And, interestingly enough, excluding fat,
the human body is about 70% water.

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.950
But when you were born you were a big old
sack of water.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.379
That's right.
A new baby is 78% water.

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:00.950
Now, that number drops to 65% by the time
that baby is 1 year old.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.200
And it'll drop even further to about 60% when
you're an adult... man.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.209
Adult women are only about 55% water.
This is because women's physiology on average

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.459
contains more fat, which doesn't hold as much
water as lean tissue.

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.959
In fact, fat people, regardless of gender,
contain less water than thin people.

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.639
Earth has a lot of water, but it's almost all salty.

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:36.239
96.5% of the water on Earth is in the oceans.
Another 3.4% of Earth's water can be found

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.709
in other large bodies of water or frozen inside
glaciers or ice caps.

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.749
But you, me, all the other animals we see,
other manufactured products?

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:54.590
They all contain water.
About 0.0003% of Earth's total water.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.310
And all of the storms and clouds and rain
and thunderstorms happening contain only about

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:09.310
0.0001% of all the water Earth has.
That's a lot of water, but despite that fact,

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.590
almost a billion people on Earth don't have
access to potable water.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.140
Potable comes from the Latin for "to drink,"
which means clean, safe water free from disease

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.160
and contamination.
The number of people on Earth who do not have

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.580
sustainable access to potable water is equivalent
to the number of people living inside the

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.810
United States.
Except multiplied by three.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:44.570
And every year 3.5 million people die because
of non-potable water-related diseases.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.950
That's equivalent to the entire population
of Los Angeles.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:56.560
So every year, Earth, our planet, looses an
entire city of Los Angeles because people

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.050
don't have access to clean water.
So today, on World Water Day, it's worth talking

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.060
about organisations that are making a difference,
because things don't have to be the way that

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.530
they are.
Organisations like Water.org help local communities

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.510
build sustainable clean water solutions that
the community itself will own.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:24.290
Now, they gave me a chance to go out to India
to see this in action, along with WheezyWaiter and Strawburry17.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.730
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to go, but those

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.030
other two people were and they've got videos
over on their channels about their experiences.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.810
So go check those out and if you wanna learn
more, got water.org/vsauce to see how you

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:36.850
can help.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.220
And as always,

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.260
thanks for watching.
