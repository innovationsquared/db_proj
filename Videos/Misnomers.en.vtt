00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.850
Hey Vsauce, Michael here.

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.320
I'm sorry. Look, I didn't name myself but
apparently

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.889
Michael is the ninth most disliked baby name

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.109
for a boy - 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.340
according to a survey by BabyNameWizard.com

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.439
At least it didn't top the charts like the rhyming

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.360
 a 'den' names - Jayden, Brayden, Aiden.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.260
The most disliked

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.550
name for a baby girl, by the way, was

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.910
Nevaeh - 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.060
'heaven' backwards.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.140
Names can be more than just
controversial - they can also be

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.689
just plain wrong, or misleading.

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:44.089
MISNOMERS

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.680
And I'm not talking about the daughter of Mr. Nomer.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.640
Over the summer I went to Singapore

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.870
and I saw many many things. I saw

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.489
an infinity pool, the world's largest
column-less glass house,

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.010
beautiful beautiful orchids, including

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.150
the laboratories where scientists
genetically design custom orchids

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.330
and very very

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.920
humid air that condensed all over my cool glasses.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.960
But even after I cleaned my glasses off

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.100
I didn't see any Lions.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.360
In fact, it's believed that no Lions have ever

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.840
naturally lived

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.100
in Singapore, even though Singapore comes from a Malay word for

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.600
Lion City.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.080
It's believed that in 1299 when Sang Nila Utama named Singapore,

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.780
he mistakenly thought that a tiger he saw was a Lion.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.400
It's a misnomer.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.369
But here

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.700
is the biggest mystery of them all, did I

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.149
really go to Singapore?

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:51.809
I mean, look at these photos.

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:53.809
That guy certainly looks like me

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.199
but he's not exactly like me.

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:59.100
I have made a video about misnomers

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.340
and that guy hasn't.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.799
This photo was from May,

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.429
and since May I have been to Australia, New Zealand.

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.929
The guy in these photos has never been there.

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:09.879
I am similar

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.140
to that guy but he's not exactly

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.680
me.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.480
We can resolve this problem by realising

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.769
that oranges are apples

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.019
You see, in Old English the word 'apple' was used to describe

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.709
apples, but also any fruit in general.

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.629
For instance, dates were 'finger apples' and bananas

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.879
were 'apples of paradise'. Cucumber's

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.679
were 'Earth apples'.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.980
In French the word for 'apple' acted similarly,

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.920
giving us 'Earth apple' for the potato.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.340
In the Middle Ages the old French word for

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.370
orange meant 'apple of the orange tree'.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.160
And the Swedish word for orange still means 'apple'

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.940
from China because Orange's originated in the East.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.560
But this leads us to an even bigger
question: what came first

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.910
orange, the fruit or orange, the colour?

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.120
Well, the answer is neither.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.520
The tree came first.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.240
The word 'orange' comes from the Sanskrit
word for the tree

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.160
that these fruits grow on.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.560
Before being introduced

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.100
to these fruits the English-speaking
world called this colour

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.440
not orange, but yellow-red.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.250
The first recorded use of the word
'orange' to refer to the colour,

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.400
instead of the fruit, wasn't until 1512.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.680
So the colour was named after the fruit,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.780
which was named after the tree that it came from.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.640
But what's a fruit?

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.340
Well, botanically a fruit is a part of a
flowering plant that disseminates

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.120
seeds, like an apple or an orange or a lemon or a grape.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.360
In cooking, because they're not sweet,
we tend to call things like wheat grains

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.319
and bean pods

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.530
vegetables, even though they are actually fruits.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.700
Vegetable is a culinary term for other
edible parts of a plant that

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.660
aren't fruit, like roots or leaves.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.590
Corn on the cob

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.170
tastes like a vegetable but scientifically

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.970
corn kernels are fruits,

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.060
which means that corn on the cob is really just a bunch

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.040
of fruits

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.560
packed together.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.080
One of the veggies we put on our pizza

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.510
is the mushroom.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.450
Of course, mushrooms aren't really

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.150
vegetables because they aren't even plants.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.850
They're fungi.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.120
Names can also be confusing because of Stigler's Law -

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.380
our tendency to name things

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.910
not after who discovered them, or
originated them, but instead

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.890
to simply honour someone else.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.080
Venn diagrams are cool.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.980
They were named after John Venn in the 1880s,

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.960
although Leonhard Euler actually introduced them

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.780
in 1768.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.980
And Avogadro's Constant?

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.310
Not actually discovered by Avogadro.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.039
He proposed

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.660
that such a number could exist but it was a different guy

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.680
who discovered the exact figure.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.510
Straight up misnomers

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.850
are my favorite.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.570
French horns are not French

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.300
Your Funny bone is not a bone; it's a nerve.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.460
The Ulnar nerve.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.660
And this is not

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:20.789
Big Ben.

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:23.979
Nothing about this is officially called Big Ben.

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.140
Its real name is The Elizabeth Tower.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.159
People often say that the bell inside is named Big Ben

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:32.719
but even that's not true.

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:35.099
The main bell inside Elizabeth Tower

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.110
is officially called The Great Bell.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.310
The Great Bell's nickname is Big Ben

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.450
and we have since applied that nickname for a bell

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.930
to the entire tower.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.169
Kosher salt isn't actually

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.680
kosher, it's just used to make things kosher,

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.440
to draw blood out of meat.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.240
So really it should be called Koshering salt.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.919
The Rocky Mountain Oyster of course
is not

00:05:58.919 --> 00:05:59.759
seafood -

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.919
it's a fried bull testicle.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.460
Arabic Numerals are not

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.479
Arabic, they were invented in India but introduced

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.459
to Europe by Arab mathematicians.

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:12.819
Haley's comet is named after Edmund Hayley

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.260
but had been witnessed by people at least as early as 240 BC.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.699
Peanuts are not nuts, they're legumes,

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.800
and coconuts are not nuts, they're drupes -

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.520
stone fruit, like cherries, apricots, peaches, etc.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.740
French fries,

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.600
as they are especially known in America,

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.680
are not from America

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.320
but were probably named by
British and American soldiers

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.570
during the First World War, who discovered
them where they were likely

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.470
invented... Belgium.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.389
Now since French was the official language of the Belgian Army,

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:46.870
the soldiers may have mistakenly thought
they were in France.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.660
Koala Bears are not bears, they just
kind of look like they are

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.680
and egg plants don't grow eggs.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.480
Eighteenth-century cultivators

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.940
simply thought they kind of resembled eggs.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.500
Dry cleaning isn't dry at all,

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.240
it involves lots of wet liquids but just not water.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.900
And, silly guy, hamburgers are not
named after ham,

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.800
the pork product, they're named after
Hamburg, Germany.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.810
Probably because at

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.440
Hamburg citizens who emigrated to the US

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.580
and brought their minced beef patty, a
Hamburg steak with them.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.580
Guinea pigs are not pigs at all, they're just

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.590
similar looking to pigs - kind of.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:25.210
And Greenland

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:29.639
isn't green land at all, it's believed
that about a thousand years ago

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:33.909
Erik the Red named it Greenland hoping that
the name would trick settlers

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:35.329
into coming over.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.760
We drive on parkways

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.860
and park on driveways not because

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.960
work makers want to confuse us but
because the park in parkways

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.409
refers not to stopping a car but to the
nature parks

00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:50.389
parkways often run along.

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:52.940
Skeuomorphs are design elements that

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.400
today are merely ornamental,

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.210
even though in the past originally

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.830
they had a purpose.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.479
For instance, on a modern mobile phone

00:08:01.479 --> 00:08:04.849
the icon for phone call is shaped like an

00:08:04.849 --> 00:08:06.609
old phone.

00:08:06.609 --> 00:08:07.930
The icon for e-mail

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.750
is shaped like an old snail mail envelope.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.479
Or, when you take a camera phone picture,

00:08:13.479 --> 00:08:16.840
you hear the sound of a mechanical shutter,

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.740
even if your phone doesn't have one that
makes that noise.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.340
Older cameras did,

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.460
so the new ones do too.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.900
It's a skeuomorph.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.400
Your own name is a kind of skeuomorph.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.400
Let's call it a skeuonom.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.560
It was necessary at birth

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:39.419
your parents gave it to you but before
they knew exactly what you would be like

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:40.839
when you grew up.

00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:43.399
You have changed since you were born

00:08:43.399 --> 00:08:46.259
but your name has stayed the same.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.779
When we called it

00:08:47.779 --> 00:08:50.910
'The Moon', we didn't know that we would find

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:54.779
other moons in the solar system. When you
were named

00:08:54.779 --> 00:08:59.890
no one knew how you would change, or what you would become, and you change

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.150
frequently.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.660
You change many, many times

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.700
over the course of your life.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:06.920
You learn things,

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:11.170
you forget things, you meet people, you stop
talking to people.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:15.269
You experience things for the first time,
at a cellular level

00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:19.040
millions of times a second you change
costume,

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.910
cells die and new ones are born.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:27.100
And, at the atomic level, with the
exception of non-living

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.540
things, like tattoos and piercings,

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:30.899
every five years

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.959
pretty much every single atom in your
body is replaced.

00:09:34.959 --> 00:09:38.160
So to what degree is the future or past

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.320
you, really you now.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.670

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.269
puts this in a really cool perspective
in his book 'There Are Two

00:09:46.269 --> 00:09:48.989
Errors in the the Title of This Book*'

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.000
"That person, who will have your name

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.720
in the very far future, will be connected
only very tenuously to the present you.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.500
The person will remember very few of
your current experiences,

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:06.810
will be psychologically quite different,
will have a body that resembles your

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.290
present one only a bit,

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:11.830
and contains almost none of the same matter.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.380
So it seems that this person is the
future you

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.640
only to a small degree.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.840
In a way, in terms of memories and experiences in history,

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.290
you have more in common with a
stranger today

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:28.050
than you do with yourself 10 or 20
years ago."

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:32.110
Martin goes even further, saying why be afraid of death

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.920
if the future you who dies will resemble
you today

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.440
so little?

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.820
Well, to that I say

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.510
YOLO?

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:45.050
Well, it's probably more accurate
to say

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:47.650
YOLOBLOMLMTAASOSBTDPWKEOBOIODAW-

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:48.680
CHEOBOITOD.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.450
You only live once, but living once means
living

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.700
many times, as a series of similar,

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.920
but technically different people, who
know each other, but only in one direction,

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.880
and who can help each other, but only in
the other direction.

00:11:06.209 --> 00:11:07.469
And as always,

00:11:07.469 --> 00:11:09.069
 thanks for watching.
