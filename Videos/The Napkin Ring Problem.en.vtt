00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:10.289
Hey, Vsauce! Michael here! If you core a sphere; that is, remove a cylinder from it, you'll be left with a shape

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.759
called a Napkin ring because, well, it looks like a napkin ring!

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.100
It's a bizarre shape because if two Napkin rings have the same height, well

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.209
they'll have the same volume regardless of the size of the spheres they came from! (Cool)

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.269
This means that if you cut equally tall napkin rings from an orange and from the Earth,

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.070
well, one could be held in your hand. The other would have the circumference of our entire planet,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.700
but both would have the same volume...

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.329
I mentioned this counterintuitive fact while making a Kendama with Adam Savage. Check that video out if you haven't, or better yet,

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.959
just come see us. We're bringing brain candy live to 24 new cities this fall. It's going to be busy, but right now

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.570
We're talking about balls and coring them!

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.859
I have here TWO napkin rings from very differently sized spheres; one is from a tiny ball,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.580
just a little tomato that I've cored, so it's got a little hole in it right there.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.129
The other Napkin ring is made from an orange,

00:01:08.129 --> 00:01:12.880
but both Napkin rings have the same height. The tomato has a smaller

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:20.280
circumference than the orange which means less volume, but its ring is thicker which means more volume. Both of those effects

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.980
exactly cancel out. So these two napkin rings have identical volumes they take up the same amount of space

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.260
By the way orange oil is flammable

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.020
To see why the napkin ring problem is true,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.070
let's discuss Cavalieri's principle. It states that for any two solids like these two cylinders I've built here

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.409
sandwiched between parallel planes if any other parallel plane

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.299
Intersects both in regions of equal area no matter where it's taken from

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:02.069
Well then the solids have the same volume. That's clearly true here these cylinders are built out of stacks of VSauce stickers

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.519
100 in each Stack so their volumes are the same

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.910
if I

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:15.430
Skew one of them like this it shape will change, but it's volume hasn't it's still contained the same amount of stuff

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.430
I haven't added or subtracted stickers

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.330
And Cavalieri's principle ensures that they still have the same volume because any cross-section taken from down here up here in the middle anywhere

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:33.279
Will always give us a region of the same area as the other because those regions are always equal area circles.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.430
Now let's Apply Cavalieri's principle to Napkin Rings

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.600
We can see that two napkin Rings with similar Heights have

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.480
identical volumes by showing that when cut by a plane the area of one's cross section

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.510
Always equals the area of the others now to do this

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.830
Notice that the area of the spheres cross section minus the area of the cylinders cross section gives us the area of the Napkin rings

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.760
Cross section. Depending on where we slice the Napkin ring the cross sections will have different areas

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:08.200
But they will always be the same as each other. Let's calculate the areas of these blue rings

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:16.780
first of all let's call the height of the Napkin ring h and the radius of the sphere they're cut from

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.170
capital R

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:25.630
Alright, perfect now a cross section of a sphere like this and a cross section of a cylinder like this are both circles

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.350
So their areas can be determined by using Pi times the radius squared

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:37.510
So if we want to find the area of the spheres cross section and subtract the area of the cylinders cross section

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.839
(I'll draw a picture of a cylinder here), all we need to do is take Pi

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.890
multiply it by the radius of the sphere cross section

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:52.749
Square that and then subtract Pi times the radius of the cylinder Squared, but what are their Radii?

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:01.059
Well, if this is the center of the sphere we can draw a line straight up to the corner of the cylinder down the side

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.869
of the cylinder and then connect to form a right triangle

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.400
The Pythagorean Theorem will really help us here it tells us that the length of one side squared plus the length of the other side

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.600
squared equals the length of the hypotenuse squared

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.900
Now this distance right here this side of the triangle what we want

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:28.229
It's the radius of the cylinder, so we'll call this the little r radius of the cylinder (beautiful little picture there)

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.080
so the radius of

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.389
the cylinder

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.840
squared plus

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.169
this side length, which is just half the height of the cylinder, so the height of the cylinder divided by 2

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.370
squared

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:52.290
Equals the hypotenuse squared the hypotenuse happens to be the radius of the sphere itself which is capital R

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.179
Perfect now let's solve for the radius of the cylinder. Which is what we want

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.269
We'll just subtract h over 2 squared from both sides that'll give us the radius of the cylinder

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.169
squared

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.189
equaling the radius of the sphere squared minus

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.799
Half the height of the cylinder squared

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.680
We can take the square root of both sides so that we wind up with the radius of the cylinder

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.269
equaling the square root of the radius of the sphere

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.570
minus 1/2 the height of the cylinder squared

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:32.160
Perfect ok now let's take a look at the area of a cross-section of the sphere now for this

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.020
let's draw a straight line from the center out to the edge of

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.220
the sphere's

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:44.060
Cross-section, and we'll go straight down and connect back up, hey look! Another right triangle

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.489
let's call this height y

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:54.540
And notice that this distance now the side of the triangle down here is actually the radius

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:55.680
 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.960
of the circle

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:04.889
Cross-section up here. They're both equal so we even want to solve for this the radius of the circle that is the spheres cross-section

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.710
Okay

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.609
so we know that the radius of

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:13.739
The sphere's Cross-Section squared plus this distance squared (which is y)

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.460
Equals the hypotenuse squared well, what do you know the hypotenuse is the radius of the sphere again (capital R)

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.699
Ok let's subtract y squared from both sides the radius of the spheres cross-section squared

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.109
equals the radius of the sphere squared minus

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.649
Y squared will take the square root of both sides and end up

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.780
learning that the radius of the sphere's cross-section equals the square root of

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.399
The radius of the sphere squared minus y squared. Y is the height that this

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:53.410
Cross-section is taken from above the equator the higher up we take these cross sections of the sphere the smaller their radii will be

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.339
Whereas the cylinders radius is always the same no matter where we cut from

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.969
Anyway, let's take these two Radii and plug them into our formula

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.110
Okay, the area of the cross section of the sphere is what we want first

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.310
Okay, that's just the square root of R squared minus y squared

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:17.900
Not too bad now the radius of the cylinder is the square root of R squared minus

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:25.240
Half the height of the cylinder squared now what you might notice is that we're taking the square root of something and then squaring it

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.550
These actually cancel each other out

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.369
perfect! Much more simple looking

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:38.260
But now let's distribute Pi to the terms inside the parentheses so pi times R squared gives us Pi R

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.809
Squared Pi times negative y squared gives us negative pi y squared

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.150
Then a negative Pi times R

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:53.979
squared is negative pi R squared negative Pi times negative h over 2 squared is positive Pi

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.660
h over 2

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:03.200
Squared. Great, now we can keep simplifying but what you might notice is that we have a pi r squared and a

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.400
minus Pi R squared, well, that equals 0 so these

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.450
Completely cancel each other out, but what we're left with are

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:17.800
Terms containing no mention of the spheres Radius whether the radius is large or small

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:23.120
Doesn't matter all you need to know to find the area of the cross section of a napkin ring

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.360
is the height of the Napkin Ring

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:32.220
Y, of course, is bounded by the height of a napkin ring these blue areas have the same area as each other and this will

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:40.680
Be true no matter where we cut the cross section across the napkin ring meaning by Cavalieri's principle that both Napkin Rings have the same

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.420
Volume

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.940
Yay :3

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.700
(with teeth)

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.980
But what is this mean for you for life in the universe?

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.520
Well as we know if you like it you should put a ring on it

00:08:58.780 --> 00:08:59.880
but if you like It,

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.920
don't know it's finger width and only want to offer it a predetermined amount of material

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.280
you should put a napkin ring on it.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.200
And as always

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.900
Thanks for watching :D

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.460
On August 21st

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:31.320
2017 there will be a total solar eclipse the shadow of the Moon will race across the Contiguous United States

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.490
It's going to be incredible and a little bit scary

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:41.430
I'm sure I will be viewing it from Oregon with my friends at Atlas, Obscura. I can't wait, but keep your eyes

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:47.560
Safe if you want to view the eclipse you have to have special eye protection

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:52.520
the curiosity Box comes with such glasses these block

00:09:52.820 --> 00:10:00.140
99.999% of visible light that's what it takes to be able to look right at the sun as actually what I love about these glasses

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.720
There's no eclipse going on. You can still just look at the sun

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.680
Notice that it's a ball. Maybe imagine what kind of Napkin ring

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.680
You'd like to make it into. The current

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:15.540
Curiosity box is my favorite. The one that you'll get if you subscribe right now comes with all kinds of cool stuff that comes with

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:22.860
A poster showing that all the planets and pluto can fit between the earth and the moon it also comes with science gadgets like these

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.000
levitating magnetic rings

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:31.600
pretty cool also a portion of all proceeds go to alzheimer's research, so it's good for your brain and

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:38.160
Everyone else's brain check it out. I hope to see you at Brain Candy live and as always

00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:43.339
Thanks for watching
