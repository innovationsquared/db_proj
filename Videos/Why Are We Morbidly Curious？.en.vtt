00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.770
Hey Vsauce. Michael here. In 1924

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.060
psychologist Carney Landis drew lines on people's faces

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.480
and then photographed them in various
scenarios

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.520
to study facial expressions.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.440
But he didn't use actors

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.000
and he didn't tell the participants to
pretend to feel emotions. Instead,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.080
he subjected them to actual trauma.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.510
He had them do things like

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.970
smell ammonia, look at pornographic images and even reach their hand in

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.910
buckets of wet slimy frogs.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.900
His most intense directive

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.350
involved ordering them to take a knife and while being photographed

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.390
cut off the head of a living rat.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.380
Seriously.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.940
Most initially refused to cut the head off,
but eventually

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.960
two-thirds agreed to do as they were told,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.060
including a 13-year-old boy referred to
the psychology department by a doctor

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.000
for high blood pressure thought to be
caused by emotional instability.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.270
Many believe his inclusion in Landis' experiment

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.430
was an accident.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.880
If replicated today Landis might be arrested

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.259
but what is psychologically arresting
about these images

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.930
is that the unease and disgust and fear they show

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.630
is real.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.780
It's disturbing

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.499
but fascinating.

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:26.839
We are paradoxically drawn towards some
pretty repulsive things:

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.820
car accidents, car chases,

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.039
the possibility of a crash or a fight,

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.259
or a natural disaster; I mean not one that hurts anyone, of course,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.600
but one that's exciting.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.630
Celebrity scandal,

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.959
drama, disfiguration, true crime, war

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:48.020
and gore, the macarbe. Like the Kangling, a trumpet

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.920
used during Himalayan Buddhist rituals
that's made out of a human leg bone.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.799
We often feel guilty for being interested

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.759
in these types of things, after all, they are unpleasant

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.039
but yet we can't look away. Why?

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.360
Well, there is no single reason, there are
many of them

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.410
but they can be mould into a mnemonic.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.129
We like disturbing things because we like

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.669
to scream.

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.579
They give us strength, catharsis

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.190
reality, exploration, acceptance and meaning.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.099
Watching someone eat gross tasting jellybeans

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.569
or a ghost pepper or a spoonful of cinnamon or

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.030
suffer in more extreme ways, is a kinda
strange thing to like to do

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.230
but it's part of what keeps us alive.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.720
We are curious, even if the outcome

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.610
could be bad.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.980
We often find uncertainty more
unpleasant

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.540
than unpleasant certainty. At least if we look

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.040
we know.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.000
There's a neurological basis for
exploring in the face of danger.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.380
We become more attentive and alert

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.120
when we are frightened, which makes
sense.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.880
Neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.520
are released when we are scared

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.520
physically and mentally preparing us to

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.260
take on a threat or successfully escape from it.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.960
Dopamine is famously part of the brains

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.250
reward system.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.790
Dopamine is released in response to pleasurable

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.530
things, like sex and food, but that doesn't mean

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.770
our brains find disturbing things
pleasurable.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.690
It's more interesting than that.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.180
When dopamine systems

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.270
are inhibited in laboratory animals, they will cease

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.400
to seek out food

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.600
and literally starve to death; because
they no longer find food

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.360
fun?

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.960
No.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.380
If food is placed

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.760
in their mouths, they will consume it and express

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.540
signs of satisfaction.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.420
Evidence like this suggests that the brain contains

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.520
systems that motivate seeking, approaching and curiosity

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.300
for their own sake.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.160
This has implications in the study of

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.450
compulsive behaviour.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.000
Just because you want to do something

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.640
doesn't mean you like it.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.080
The rush of chemicals into our brains and bodies when we are

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.140
scared

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.180
help us. When the threats are real. But if the threats

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.620
aren't real, or if we are safely distant from them,

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.930
and merely spectating, the same chemicals still

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.790
appear, making us more attentive, more curious

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.910
and making it more difficult to look away.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.140
In the early nineteen hundreds

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.010
EugÃ¨ne-Louis Doyen published incredible
images of corpses he cut

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.340
into stackable slices. The images

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.500
are amazingly macarbe but yet utterly

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.870
fascinating and a wonderful reminder of what we are

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.370
literally made of.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.490
We often feel like we need an excuse,

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.510
like Halloween or anatomy homework, in
order to look at things like that

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.800
without coming across as a total weirdo. I mean

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.380
come on if you look too interested in
the macarbe it might look like you are

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.680
into, approve of or enjoy the gruesome.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.880
Funny enough, that guilt may very well fuel

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.270
our desire to look in the first place. Sometimes

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.729
pressure to not do something can
actually make people more likely

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:19.530
to do that thing.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.970
It's called The Boomerang Effect.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.360
There are many different ways for things to

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.800
boomerang: one is The Streisand Effect,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.220
when trying to suppress something unintentionally

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.080
makes it more widely distributed. In 2003

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.160
Barbra Streisand sued to suppress a photo

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.760
published online, as part of a
California Coastline Preservation Project.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.790
One of the photos, the one she was trying to get rid of, showed

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:46.890
her house.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.160
Within a month of the lawsuit going public

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.740
nearly half a million people had flooded
the website and downloaded the

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.430
picture. Before the suit only six people

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.470
had downloaded the image, two of which were her lawyers.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.650
In a similar fashion, social pressures
and tabboos against viewing

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.760
disturbing things can make them more

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.090
interesting,

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.530
rarer and so a more valuable commodity, and also

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.500
free, in that deliberately viewing them can demonstrate to ourselves and others

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.940
that we are free and can do what we want.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.260
Disturbing things can also make us feel

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.930
stronger, because their repulsiveness

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.190
is a challenge.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.880
Glenn Sparks at Purdue University

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.380
has studied the way terrifying films affect us.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.310
After watching them, viewers often feel stronger,

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.940
satisfied that they didn't chicken out, that they made it through,

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.640
they conquered something disturbing and were able to handle it.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.820
It's almost a form of practice. As Stephen
King put it,

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.170
"We make up horrors to help us cope with the real ones".

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.530
On the more negative side, following
celebrity scandals or seeing

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.820
defeat on the faces of the rival team

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.120
can make you feel pretty good. It's
called

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.640
'Schadenfreude', which means harm joy; getting pleasure

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.800
from others misfortunes. Social comparison theory

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.460
describes and predicts behavior like this
although grades and

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.070
rankings cause anxiety, we nonetheless
possess

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.610
a drive to seek out evaluations of ourselves

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.390
in comparison to others, we especially
enjoyed the evaluations

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.130
that put us on top.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.660
Now, causing other people to be

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.480
less well off sort of makes sense under this lens.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.500
If its relative happiness you're
concerned with, trolling or harassing or griefing

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.120
other people sort of works, it doesn't make

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.830
you happier but compared to the people
you're annoying,

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.850
you are less annoyed.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.960
So...

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.260
yay?

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.500
Viewing scenes of

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.540
anger and vengeance and violence

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.590
that don't even involve us can nonetheless cause

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:05.250
our own anger and aggression to burn off, as though they're being

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.570
satisfied. It's called catharsis,

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:14.620
a cleanser, a purification. Creating images and movies
and stories that play with our

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.790
emotions might be grasping at low

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:22.480
hanging fruit. A task beneath such logical
creatures as ourselves.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.820
Or, it might be a powerful demonstration

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.190
of the fact that we have control, or at
least a leash,

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.010
around how we feel.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.450
We condemn the actions

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:36.700
of serial killers but nonetheless often
treat them

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.760
like rock stars. Web sites like RedrumAutographs and Serial Killers Ink

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.260
sell autographs, souvenirs, trinkets
and works of art

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.360
made by real serial killers.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:54.000
Some call it murderabilia. On a spectrum of
petty thrills and morose voyeurism

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.360
to complete overwhelming obsession and fear,

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.980
our relationship with the morbid is
complicatedm

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.140
but it is under our control if we're aware

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.190
of our actions. One of the most
constructive and socially important

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:12.820
uses of the morbid is the facilitation of meaning, acceptance

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.060
and empathy.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.120
In his book 'Everyone Loves a Good Train Wreck'

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.650
Eric G. Wilson says that our attraction
to the macabre is

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.730
on some level a desire to experience

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.470
someone else's suffering.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.650
Morbid curiosity is often about the
imagination.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:33.730
Imagining what it would be like to be that
other person, what if that happened

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.990
to me? Could it happen to me?

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.120
Empathetic feelings remind us that our
time is limited

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.520
and that we are fragile and in doing so
bring us

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:48.360
closer together. Sure enough, the last
movie I watched it made me want to go

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.690
out and hug the very first friend I could find

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.950
wasn't a happy feel-good comedy. Instead,

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:58.420
it was Louis Theroux's somber 'Extreme Love Dementia'.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.300
Viewing unpleasant things

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.130
doesn't always make them less unpleasant
or any less real

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.810
but that's not always the point. Morbid
curiosity is

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.810
also about acceptance. Remember,

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:14.600
our brains are wired with motivations
to explore

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.200
unpleasant things, because doing so
can be preferable

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.880
to ignorance.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.940
Gawking at morbidity is often about asking why?

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.560
There must be a reason, a meaning behind all of this.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.410
When tragedy strikes or horrors are
revealed, we listen to experts give opinions,

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:35.200
neighbors describe the killer, we look for
signs that were missed

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.280
and confirmation that others feel the same
way we do,

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.160
that people are helping or making sure
justice

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:45.010
is served. Katelin Dodi the host of 'Ask a
Mortician'

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:48.690
here on YouTube just wrote a phenomenal book

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.230
'Smoke Gets in Your Eyes and Other
Lessons

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.650
from the Crematory'.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.740
In the book she says

00:10:55.750 --> 00:11:00.170
"accepting death doesn't mean that you won't be
devastated when someone you love dies,

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:04.130
it means you will be able to focus on
your grief, unburdened by bigger

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.830
existential questions, like

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:09.140
why do people die? And why is this
happening to me?

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.500
Death isn't happening to you, death

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.120
is happening to us all." That's heavy stuff

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.440
but acceptance like that is one of the
greatest things morbid

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.060
curiosity has to offer and don't worry,

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.490
there's a funny side to all of this, or at least

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.570
a funny side related to this

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.800
and how morbidity helps us make sense of the world.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:38.570
A study in Finland found that children were four
times as likely to be scared

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.850
by their usual television programs if a parent

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.790
was in the room.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.750
It surprised researchers
but one explanation lies

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:51.339
in the "Uh oh, Mom flinched theory".

00:11:51.339 --> 00:11:55.500
The idea is that to a young child almost
everything is brand new

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.810
but parents are older, they're wiser, they know what's normal

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:03.240
and if they are scared of what's on TV

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:08.490
uh oh... How we feel and how we feel about
how we feel

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:13.670
is to a large degree learned. There's a
theory about the origin of humor

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:19.230
called the encryption theory of humor. It
suggests that one of the great roles humor

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:23.040
plays is in measuring who is inside and
who is outside,

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.920
who is similar and who is socially
or ideologically

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:30.579
too different. Jokes test what
researchers call

00:12:30.579 --> 00:12:34.160
unstated common knowledge the teller and
listener

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.480
both share.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.579
So might we be

00:12:37.579 --> 00:12:42.240
morbidly curious for the same reason we
enjoy telling jokes?

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.519
Jokes assess underlying shared

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:49.319
attitudes. Morbidity helps us asses shared

00:12:49.319 --> 00:12:52.329
underlying attitudes of an existential

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.360
variety, morality and justice.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.069
Whether it's used for empathetic or
exploitative reasons,

00:12:59.069 --> 00:13:02.370
morbidity and laughter may share

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:06.670
a similar adaptive role. We are morbidly
curious

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:10.460
because we like to scream but more
strangely

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:14.100
the yuk...and the yuk yuk

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.920
overlap.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.620
And as always,

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.400
thanks for watching.
