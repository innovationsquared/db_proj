00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.490
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.020
Action and

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:07.310
danger is exciting but this

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.340
is a fake gun and the process

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.250
of enlarging a hole,
like the barrel of a gun, is called

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.810
boring. Boring. Boring a hole

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.550
is a slow process requiring repetitive
movements from a tool that goes in

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.240
circles,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.160
which may be why things that are slow
and repetitive and don't appear to be going

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.990
anywhere

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.070
came to be described with the same word.
They're boring. But why do we get

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.360
bored and why does it matter?
Evidence of being

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.980
temporarily uninterested in anything
happening - boredom -

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.300
has been found as far back as ancient Pompeii.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.570
Boredom is a feeling we don't like. It's

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.760
uncomfortable but it's trivial, right?
I mean, boredom happens to all of us but

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.350
now

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.960
we have Facebook and Twitter and YouTube
and texting and Candy Crush

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.059
to keep ourselves occupied.
So, really,

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.010
who cares?
Well, here's the thing.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.470
Physical pain, heartbreak and nausea are also

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.500
uncomfortable but they're caused by dangerous

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.530
serious toxic things, whereas boredom

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.350
occurs when you are merely disinterested
in the outside world

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.580
and the inner world of your thoughts,
when you are

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.840
alone with just yourself.
So,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.470
does the existence of boredom mean that
when it really comes down to it life

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.760
itself existing isn't really enough?

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.260
Arthur Schopenhauer said that "if life possessed

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.440
in itself a positive value in real content,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.600
there would be no such thing as boredom.
Mere existence would fulfil

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.410
and satisfied us."
But apparently it doesn't

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.050
because boredom exists.
Is something wrong

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.920
with being, or is something

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.660
awesome about us?
Nearly 200 hundred years ago
Giacomo Leopardi wrote in a

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.040
letter to his father

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.750
"boredom is the most sublime of all human
emotions because

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.910
it expresses the fact that the human
spirit, in a certain sense,

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.240
is greater than the entire universe.
Boredom

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.300
is an expression of a profound despair
and not finding anything that can

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.890
satisfy the souls'

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.670
boundless needs."
So, while superficially boredom might seem trivial or

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.650
childish, embarrassing, almost rude to admit to feeling,

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.950
one thing's for sure - boredom isn't

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.010
boring.
When bored, your brain activity

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.340
only drops about 5% and magnetic
resonance images of people's brains

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.330
while they were bored actually showed
greater activity in regions responsible

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.880
for

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.190
recalling autobiographical memory, conceiving

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.989
the thoughts and feelings of others and
conjuring hypothetical events -

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.380
imagining.
Jennifer Schuessler wrote about this

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.950
in her appropriately titled essay "Our boredom,

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.630
Ourselves."
She points out that in line with neurological

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.000
evidence, boredom historically has been
"an important source

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.160
of creativity, well-being and our very sense self."

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.239
It's an imposed state that leaves us

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.100
to think about ourselves, notice things
we may have overlooked and get "ancy" enough

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.350
to take productive

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.450
actions we might have otherwise put off, like

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.050
cleaning, writing or challenging the mind with puzzles

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.000
and games.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.480
As a pressure to move, boredom

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.080
may have driven us to accomplish much of
what we have achieved.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.120
But how do you measure

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.540
boredom?
The boredom proneness scale,

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.890
'BPS', assess an individual's propensity for getting

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.690
bored, in a sense their ease of being attentive.
Average

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.520
scores range between 81 and 117.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.810
We can take scores on the BPS and correlate

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.930
them with other things.
For instance, people who know themselves well

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.120
can easily label their feelings,
have high levels of self-awareness,

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.830
tend to have a lower propensity score feeling bored.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.419
But when it comes to feeling boredom frequently,

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.760
the culprit may be one's own physiology.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.180
Individuals with fewer dopamine
receptors in the brain

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.900
tend to need more excitement to stay stimulated,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.360
meaning chronic boredom may be a symptom

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.840
of the way your body is.
A symptom that if

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.860
left unchecked can become something worse

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.910
Anna Gosline lists depression,

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.500
anxiety, drug addiction, alcoholism, hostility,

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.640
poor social skills, bad grades and low work performance.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.770
In fact, the National Center on drug
abuse and addiction has reported that the

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:57.840
top three

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.100
risk factors for teenage substance abuse

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.650
are too much stress, too much spending money

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.240
and too much boredom.
The Beth Israel Medical Center in New York

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.580
reports that addicts reported levels of boredom

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.940
are the only reliable indicator of
whether or not they will stay clean.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.140
Our brains need stimulation

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.240
in order to be healthy, not so much that
they're overwhelmed but a perfect

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.870
balance

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.900
unique to each individual,
under which they can perform

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.030
optimally, with energized focus,
what psychologists call

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.960
flow.
Too little stimulation and our brains will act out,

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.139
hoping to find some somewhere to prevent
something worse

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.580
from happening.
Our brains have thaasophobia,

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.310
the fear of boredom.
Peter Toohey's "Boredom: A Lively History"

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.460
quotes Norman Doidge's findings that "nothing

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.520
speeds brain atrophy more being

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.639
immobilized in the same environment: the monotony

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:04.030
undermines our dopamine and attentional
systems crucial for maintaining

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.050
brain plasticity."
Variety

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.210
and stimulation encourage neurogenesis,
new brain cells

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.350
and can extend the lives of cells that
already exist in certain regions

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.070
of the brain.
In order to avoid a lack of stimulation,

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.639
our brains will even try to make up
their own stimulations -

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.360
hallucinations.
Hallucinations can be induced

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.260
in almost anyone's brain,
if there isn't enough stimulation

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.500
around.
For instance, the ganzfeld effect.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.090
When exposed to random noise and
unchanging monochromatic field,

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.950
the brain freaks out and starts
generating hallucinations.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.450
The effect can also be induced with
ping pong balls hemispheres

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.570
over the eyes and a radio tuned to static.

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.860
Extended sensory deprivation in a special chamber

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.120
that eliminates site, sound, smell, taste
and tactile sensations

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.790
by floating the body in a special fluid
to reduce the sensation of weight

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.090
can also cause hallucinations as well

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.850
as anxiety.
When denied proper stimulation,

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.040
the brain goes through phases that begin
with boredom

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.300
and if left unchecked can become worse.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:23.370
It's a phenomenon well-documented in
animals confined to cages

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.420
for long periods of time, and,
in a horrific case,

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:31.070
a human child named Genie.
Born

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.140
in 1957 in Arcadia, California,

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.850
Genie became one of the most famous
cases of abnormal

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:42.580
child psychology.
Her father was abusive to her and her family

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.480
and delusional. He hated the outside
world and sought to isolate his family

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.130
from it

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.540
as best he could.
He confined Genie

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:55.170
to a room with only two blacked-out
windows for the first

00:07:55.170 --> 00:08:00.150
thirteen years of her life.
He often tied her to a toilet chair

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:04.280
and never fed her solid food.
When authorities finally found her,

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.050
in 1970, she had not acquired a language

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:12.310
and had the mental age of an 18-month-old child.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.660
Genie was extensively studied and became a staple

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.870
of psychology courses, a rare example of
an impossible

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.160
experiment.
What if a human child was

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.640
isolated from human contact, social behaviors

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:31.850
and human language.
A feral child, not raised by the proverbial

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.760
wolves, but instead

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:38.580
right in the middle of suburbia.
Genie

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.159
is still alive today, her identity anonymous,

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:47.110
as a ward of the state of California.
Extended

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:51.280
under stimulation isn't just a
punishment inflicted by delusional

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.340
caretakers,

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.420
it's also a punishment inflicted on criminals,

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.990
especially in the form a solitary confinement.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.340
In the Bureau of Prisons, the record for most

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:07.140
time spent denied social contact is held

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.760
and still being set by Thomas Silverstein.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:15.180
Considered extremely dangerous,
Silverstein has been kept in solitude

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.680
since 1983.
He has barely seen a single

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.820
other human for the last 29 years.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.970
Stories like those are intense

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.760
and are far beyond everyday occasional boredom,

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.910
simple boredom.
What you feel when waiting

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.140
at an airport or listening to an
unengaging lecture

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.270
is not a disorder, it's not a moodm

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:44.010
it's an emotion. Robert Plutchik's
wheel of emotions is a great way to

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.180
visualize this.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.220
The wheel is based on 8 basic emotions extended

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.190
in order of intensity.
Boredom is positioned as a

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.840
light version of disgust.
Emotions

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.620
are not superfluous.
Normal amounts of them have a purpose.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.610
Creatures who feel emotions are often
compelled to do

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:08.260
and not do more complicated things than merely

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.540
eating, drinking, sleeping and procreating, like

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:16.140
building friendships, apologizing,
loving unconditionally and

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:20.510
planning and building for the future.
Disgust

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:24.680
is an emotion we don't like.
It keeps us from doing things. Its purpose

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.850
is most likely a warning, an alarm triggered
by things that appear rancid,

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.839
spoiled or toxic, 
that could poison us or make us sick.

00:10:32.839 --> 00:10:38.400
Like a good friend, disgust pushes us
away from such things. It guides us

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.860
in a healthy direction.
Likewise, boredom

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.320
protects us.
Monotonous speakers,

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.950
mind-numbing tasks and overloaded sameness,

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:52.930
those things aren't dirty or poisonous,
they're just not

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:57.830
stimulating enough.
Boredom compels us to new things,

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:00.860
fresh stimulation and when it can't be overcome

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:05.300
a propensity to boredom is a sign of a healthy mind.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.770
It's advantageous.
Creatures who felt it wound up

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:14.140
doing more, flourished more, which led to
more creatures like themselves,

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.790
boredness feelers.
So the next time you're

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:21.460
a little bored, be proud.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:25.130
Thank your ancestors,
you are participating in a life

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.310
improving drive, like hunger or thirst

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:31.430
that pushes us toward new and better things.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:35.260
Give yourself time away from the usual distractions

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.600
to get bored.
It will be

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.840
boring, but boring is literally how

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.360
holes get made and perfected.
Not all holes are useful but some

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.490
become people's to some pretty cool stuff.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.100
And as always,

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:52.990
thanks for watching.
