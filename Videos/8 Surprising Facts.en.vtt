Hey, Vsauce. Michael here...
Coming to you from the Barbican in London.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.780
It's beautiful, it's like living inside the
Regenstein Library.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.920
That's a concrete joke.
But, I've put together a leanback of videos

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.100
all around YouTube that I really like,
that I host as a playlist.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.940
You can start it by clicking the link at the
top of this video's description.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.100
It's best if you're on a computer or a laptop,
something like that.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.120
But to make it worth your time in this video,
I'm going to share some facts I learned this

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:34.160
week that were quite surprising and cool.
For instance, being attractive might actually

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.400
mean that you are better, if you play American football.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.880
When females were asked to rank the hotness
of male American football players, there was

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.700
a quite surprising correlation.
The players that the females ranked as being

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:55.139
hotter also tended to be the players with
the highest passing ratings.

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:58.499
Passing.
Not like passing in a car with a... with a

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.699
football.
But passing in a car brings up the question

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.799
of gas prices.
When gas prices go up, fewer people drive

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.299
and when fewer people are driving,
 there are fewer accidents.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.700
It's actually quite mathematical.
It has been shown that for every 10% increase

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.220
in the cost of gas,
the number of car accidents goes down by 2.3%.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.380
Fewer accidents means fewer deaths.
And here's a fact about death.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:35.100
More people have died inside the Halo games
than have ever died in real life on Earth,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.860
throughout the entire history of humans being around.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.240
Killing somebody in real life makes you a murderer.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.940
But the definitions of terms like that are very specific.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:58.079
For instance, if you kill four or more people
at one time, you're technically considered

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.539
by the FBI a mass murderer.
And if you kill two or more people, sometimes

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:09.319
three or more people, with a time gap in between
those events - a cooling down period, you

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:16.440
are technically a serial killer. Based on the number of unsolved murders, criminologists

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.640
estimate that in the United States, at any
given time, there are about 100 serial killers

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.280
who have yet to be caught walking amongst us.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.160
So, keep your eyes peeled or blink if you want to.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:38.700
I mean, the average person blinks 15 times a minute.
But when you watch television or YouTube videos,

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.620
you blink even less frequently - only about
7.5 times a minute.

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.510
So why blink more often than you have to?
Go ahead and click the link at the top of

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.879
the description to play the Vsauce Leanback.
It's sure to keep your eyes open, because

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:58.399
it's full of videos around the topic of surprise.
I'll see you over there, be sure to subscribe

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.580
to Vsauce for more videos...

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.670
And as always,

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.390
thanks for watching.
