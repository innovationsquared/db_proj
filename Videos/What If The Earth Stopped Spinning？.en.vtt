00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.640
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. The Earth is spinning

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.580
and we are spinning along with
it. But what if the

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.610
Earth suddenly stopped spinning? 
Well, first of all, you would

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.650
gain weight. But that would be the least

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.910
of your worries. The spin of our planet is important

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.119
and literally giving you the time of your life.

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.170
At the equator, the surface of Earth, and

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.570
everything on it, is spinning around at
465 meters per second.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.270
As you move closer to the poles you
don't have to move as quickly to complete

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.200
Earths daily rotation. 
Here in San Francisco, the Earth is driving me

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.969
east at 368 meters per second. 
If I could float above the surface

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.079
independent of the Earth's rotation, the
Earth would spin underneath me

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.329
this quickly. Pretty cool. But, of course,
when I jump straight up into the air,

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.660
the Earth doesn't move underneath me
because I continued to spin with it.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.799
We are all spinning with the Earth and
that is why slamming on a set of

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.670
magical planetary breaks that caused
everything

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.180
classically called earth to stop
spinning would be catastrophic.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.080
Immediately everything that wasn't

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.799
Earth, and wasn't safely at the poles,
would continue moving, as it had been,

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.470
and be flung due east at more than a
thousand miles an hour.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.140
You wouldn't be flung into space because
escape velocity is 24,800 mph

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.479
but your body would

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.140
instantly become a 9.5 inch caliber bullet.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.450
Well, really more of a supersonic tumbleweed.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.200
Because the atmosphere would more
gradually slow down, people in airplanes,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.990
assuming they could navigate the
resulting storms, might have a better

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.299
chance of surviving.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.180
Astronauts aboard the ISS would fare even better.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.869
But it is unlikely that anyone would be waiting for them

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.369
down on the ground. Runways would just be

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.860
entrances to the new planet-sized graveyard,

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.969
created by the no longer spinning Earth.

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:13.861
People really really near the poles
might be okay but

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.040
only at first. Gusts of wind, as fast as
those near an atomic bomb detonation,

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.069
would blast, pass the surface and up into the
sky forming worldwide storms

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.519
of unprecedented magnitude. The friction alone,

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.109
caused by the now stopped Earth colliding
with these winds, would be enough to cause

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:31.359
massive fires,

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:35.499
unparalleled erosion and damage to
anything strong enough to stay put

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:40.569
after the initial braking. The Sun would
seem to freeze in the sky as days

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.340
became not 24 hours long but 365 days long.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.359
Without spinning innards, Earth's
protective magnetic field would cease to exist

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.659
and we would be dosed with deadly
amounts of ionising radiation from the Sun.

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:01.059
The oceans would surge onto land in
tsunamis kilometers high and wash over nearly

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.269
all dry land, before migrating to the poles,

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.079
where gravity is stronger, no longer held to
the ocean basins by the inertia

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.699
Earth's spin gave them,

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.300
until Earth itself, no longer bulging an extra 42
kilometers around its equator, because

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:18.439
of its rotation

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.620
slowly compressed into a more perfect sphere

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.340
than it is now. Possibly allowing the
oceans to eventually return somewhat.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.200
That is what would occur

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.639
if it actually happened.
It won't actually happen but

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.719
woah, its rotation is slowing down.

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:40.169
More on that later. First, if the Earth
really is spinning so quickly,

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.029
why can't we feel it? Why doesn't the Earth's rotation

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:47.249
make us dizzy? Well, lucky for us,

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:51.699
the change in velocity is just too
gradual. The Earth is too huge.

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.859
It's like driving in a car that takes

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.739
6 hours and six thousand miles to make
one

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.769
left turn. It's not sudden enough to
register

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.260
with our senses. But that change in velocity

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.290
is real and it makes us way

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.299
less, because of inertia. On our spinning
planet your velocity is constantly

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.760
changing but always

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.689
tangential to the circular path you were
being dragged along.

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:24.389
Now, because inertia is a property of
matter, which includes

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.720
your body, without a force acting upon us we would

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.240
slowly leave the surface of Earth.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.580
Luckily, the Earth is exerting a force on us.
A center-seeking,

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.050
centripetal force, delivered by gravity.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.319
The centripetal force required to keep
you along a circular path with Earth is subtracted

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:47.539
from Earth's total gravitational pull on you.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.080
The remaining force simply pushes you down,

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.530
toward the centre of the Earth - it gives you weight.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.699
At the equator, if the Earth didn't spin,
and no centripetal force was required to

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:58.639
keep you

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.240
with the Earth, you would weigh 0.3 percent

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.509
more than you currently do. If Earth spun you around

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:11.409
17 times faster than it currently does,
all of its gravitational force

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:15.039
would go toward centripetal force
fighting against your inertia

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.779
and you would be weightless.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.259
So here's a diet idea. Hope that the Earth starts

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:26.159
spinning faster and go back for guilt-free seconds.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.460
Seconds.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.669
We know exactly how long

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.689
a second is. The outermost electron

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:39.540
of an atom of cesium 133 is alone.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.200
When the atom is undisturbed, only the nucleus

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.870
interacts with this outermost electron, tickling it

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.400
regularly and rapidly between two levels.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:56.400
After 9,192,631,770

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.120
oscillations between those two levels,
one second has passed.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.080
Exactly.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.949
That is literally the definition of a second.

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:12.909
We can measure and count those oscillations.

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:16.539
It's how atomic clocks work. Making atomic clocks,

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:22.619
the most accurate measurement device
ever built by humans, to measure anything.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.820
We can't define

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:30.430
a second more simply, as say, 1/60th of 1/60th of 1/24th of a day

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:34.120
because of Earth's spin.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.560
It's too irregular. Little changes

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.090
in the distribution of mass on Earth,
caused by earthquakes or melting ice

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.080
or man-made dams or technically

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.939
even you walking up stairs or downstairs,

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:51.520
cause Earth's rotational speed to change.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:57.280
Like a figure skater moving their arms
further away from or closer to their bodies.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.840
Now add on top of that the fact that tides, caused by the Moon,

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:04.069
drag against Earth's rotation and you
wind up with an

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:07.069
unstable rotation speed that is

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:10.069
predominately slowing down.

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:14.800
Now, these changes are incredibly incredibly
slight, but over time

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.219
they add up. In 140 million years,

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:23.120
a day on earth will not be 24 hours long,

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.659
it will be 25. That might not sound like much

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:32.289
but in order to do important things, like
deliver accurate GPS information,

00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:35.680
we need a more accurate timekeeping device

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.020
than that. So, as a solution

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.189
scientists keep the pace of seconds
using atomic clocks,

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:46.259
TAI time. And other scientists

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:50.900
measure the changing speed of Earth's
rotation by observing distant stars

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.360
and quasars. Now, every few months they
find out just how behind or ahead

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.259
Earth is running, and if it's getting too
close to being a second

00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:03.569
off, they decide to add or subtract the
second from the current year.

00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:06.680
The result is the time used almost everywhere,

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.889
including your phone: UTC.

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:13.159
Since this system began in 1972

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:16.400
25 leap seconds have been added.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.590
What this means is that clock time is,

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.759
and has to be, a manufactured

00:08:22.759 --> 00:08:26.330
product with upgrades and tune ups administered

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.099
periodically, after defects

00:08:30.099 --> 00:08:34.380
are noticed. The time we give to now

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:38.039
and the future is only ever

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:41.339
approximate. That's weird

00:08:41.339 --> 00:08:44.440
but it's also entirely not weird.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.570
As Demetrios Matsakis, the Chief
Scientist of Time Services for the US

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.930
Naval Observatory puts it,

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.980
"we save lives

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:59.600
and we end lives. We add time and we
can take time away,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.620
but in both cases we do so
without completely

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.709
understanding exactly what life is,

00:09:05.709 --> 00:09:08.549
or what time is."

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:13.540
Regardless, thank you for spending some
of yours with me...

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:14.540
and as always,

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.380
thanks for watching.
