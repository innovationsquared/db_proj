00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.260
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.250
When will you die? I don't mean you

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.000
specifically, I mean the mean of you all - the average

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.680
Vsauce viewer. By combining World
Health Organization life tables with YouTube

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.010
analytics for Vsauce viewers, we can calculate

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.710
that the average date everyone over the age of 15

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.950
watching this video right now will die on is

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.410
8:42 in the morning, November 28th, 2059.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.400
The mode is in 2073.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.870
Morbidly, but mathematically, about 340

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.780
of the people who watch this video this
week will not be around at this time

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.240
next year. These statistics are based on
averages but interestingly

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.620
the average person considers him or
herself anything

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.160
but average. Studies have consistently shown that the

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.270
average person believes he or she will
live a longer and healthier life

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.750
than the average person. We overestimate

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.690
the likelihood that bad things will
happen to other people and underestimate

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.980
the likelihood that they will happen to
us. It's a natural part of our psychology,

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.030
but, yeah, we miscalculate risk in many fascinating

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.000
ways. K.C. Cole points out that we are
often more responsive to threats that are personal

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.010
exotic, erratic and dramatic

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.620
than we are to threats that are well more likely.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.650
I love one of her examples - imagine a
world where cigarettes

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.600
are harmless, but one cigarette pack

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.670
out of every eighteen thousand seven
hundred and fifty contains

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.960
a single cigarette laced with dynamite
that, when lit,

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.060
violently explodes, blowing the user's head off.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.040
People would be loudly

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.010
and messily losing their heads every
day all over the world

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.090
but in that imaginary universe the same
number of people would die every day

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.360
because of smoking

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.450
that already do. The results

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.550
would just be more shocking, more
immediate and probably more likely to

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.010
affect our decisions.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.600
Last month, I and some of my favourite
YouTube creators met

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.750
with President Obama about the decisions

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.830
Americans make when it comes to
protecting themselves from the cost

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.220
of staying healthy. The issue with health
care is mired in conflict and debate

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.459
matched only by the turmoil of risk
assessment going on

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.039
in our own minds.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.300
Our myelinated machines use more biases and
shortcuts to evaluate probabilities

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.550
than can fit in a single video, but a
particularly strong example

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.610
is the availability heuristic. Our
tendency to think that something is more likely

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.380
because it happened recently or there
are more examples of it happening

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.010
available in our memories, not because it
actually is more likely.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.110
We also over exaggerate risks we don't
have control over

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.430
while being comparatively fearless in
the face of equal

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.530
risks we nonetheless can control. Chianti
Stars famous 1969 study on risk

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.890
found that people were willing to accept risks
1,000 times greater

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.090
if they could control them, for instance,
driving a car than if they

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.720
didn't have control, for instance, a
nuclear disaster.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.410
Let's talk about Abraham Wald.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.120
Only so much extra armour can be added to
an airplane before it becomes too heavy to fly.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.600
Now, during World War 2 the US military
noticed the planes returning

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.220
from enemy territory were usually damage
around the wings,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.130
the body and the tail gunners.
So, they put more armour

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.550
on those areas. But it didn't make a
difference. The same number of planes

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.620
continued to be lost. So the military hired Wald

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.550
for his mathematical super powers.
He told them to put what little

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.790
armour they could on the parts of the planes that

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.280
weren't being hit. Why?

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.860
Well, because returning planes were survivors.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.700
They took damage in areas where a plane
can take damage

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.080
and survive. Damage to other areas
caused the plane to

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.030
not return.
Wald was protecting them against

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.760
survivorship bias - only paying attention

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.240
to successes. A similar phenomenon is
partly responsible for why music

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.300
feels like it was just better back in
the day than it is now.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.229
Is that really true or are we just remembering

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:39.680
the good stuff? Wald's work saved
thousands of lives and made flying safer

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.860
for many more. Tragically, a few years
later Wald and his wife

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.560
died in an airplane crash. You can't

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.660
predict how and when you will die, it's not that easy.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.280
But a few risk scoring systems have been created

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.320
to make the discussion and comparison of
hazardous behaviors

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.540
clearer. The micromort was conceived by

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:09.200
Ronald A. Howard and is an amount of risk
equal to a one in 1,000,000 probability

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.400
of dying. John Green discussed Micromorts

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.680
in a fantastic mental floss video you
should watch, if you haven't already.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.900
He points out that a single skydive
temporarily increases your

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.570
death risk by seven micromorts - a seven

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.890
in 1,000,000 chance of dying. That's the same

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.870
as smoking 5 cigarettes. It's been
estimated that you gain one micromort

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.640
for every half litre of wine you drink.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.840
Every year you spend drinking Miami tap water, every 1,000 miles you fly in a jet plane,

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.940
every 230 miles you travel by car, every
20 miles you travel by bicycle

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.110
and every 6 miles you travel by motorcycle

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.680
or canoe. There is a happier

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.419
unit of risk - the microlife. Proposed by
David Spiegelhalter and Alejandro Leiva,

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.650
a microlife is gained by doing helpful

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.159
things. In small quantities their benefits are roughly

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:10.229
linear and one microlife is the equivalent of

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:14.770
30 extra minutes of life.
Twenty minutes of moderate exercise

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.300
gives you two more microlives.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.009
Two hours of sedentary behavior

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:25.440
-1 microlives. Plenty of

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.639
non-scientific websites exist that allow
you to calculate when you will die

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:33.659
based on your life expectancy and habits.

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:37.349
PokeMyBirthday.com is the kind of goofy site

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:40.419
that takes a nonetheless interesting look
at not your death,

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:44.520
but your birth. Enter your birthday and
see when you were conceived,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.440
when your mother probably first realized
she was pregnant with you

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.629
and the dates your parents created or
moved into position the two cells

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:56.729
that eventually became the thirty trillion cells

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:01.349
that are now watching this video. Every single person

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:04.860
who ever died, died right here on planet Earth.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.889
Except for three.

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:10.919
The crew of Soyuz 11.

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:15.069
On June 30th, 1979, their cabin depressurized,

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:18.580
while returning to Earth, before they
crossed the agreed-upon boundary between

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.909
Earth and outer space. Far from

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:25.740
any populated area, a three-sided metallic columns

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.520
sits where they're craft landed in Kazakhstan.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.699
It's a remote memorial to humankind's

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:36.430
remotest deaths. We haven't

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:41.330
all died here on Earth, but so far we have all been born

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.380
here. Thanks for being here.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.300
Stay safe, and as always,

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.300
 thanks for watching.
