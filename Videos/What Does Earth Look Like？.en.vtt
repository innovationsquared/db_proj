00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:03.609
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:06.980
This point of light in the sky is

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.889
Earth as seen from the surface of Mars.

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.630
And this is Earth as seen from Saturn.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.779
Here's an image taken only 45,000 kilometres away,

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.680
the famous Blue Marble. But what does

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.600
Earth really look like?

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.220
Well, it depends on how you define "look".

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.829
The word look comes from
the old Breton word "lagud",

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.160
mean eye, the human eye.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.300
And that's part of the problem.
Images like this are based on light

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.559
humans can see. But we don't see

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.910
everything.
There's a fantastic episode of Radiolab that uses

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.289
sound to illustrate just how different other creature

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.879
visual spaces are from our our own.
When we talk about the way something

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.219
physically looks

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.710
we are talking about the visual perception of emitted

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.170
or reflected electromagnetic radiation.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.690
Specifically, visible light.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.620
Light we perceive as red has a longer wavelength

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.490
than blue or violet.
But what if I crank the wavelength

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.710
even shorter? Does it stop being light?

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.799
No, it just becomes light

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.439
you can't see - ultraviolet, X-rays,

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.119
gamma rays.
Going the other way, you get infrared,

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.390
microwaves and finally, radio waves.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.509
In principle, the spectrum of possible

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.689
electromagnetic wavelengths is infinite.

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.890
But even within the range of wavelengths we observe,

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.960
the breadth is breathtaking. If the entire

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.030
practical spectrum of wavelengths was laid out

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.079
linearly from New York to Los Angeles,
the visual portion we see

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.159
would only be the size of

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.660
100 nanometers. Small enough

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.270
to slip through a surgical mask. Point is,

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.860
when it comes to what their is to see, our

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.940
eyes miss out on lot. For instance,

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.870
take a look a remote control.
Many of  these things communicate with light

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.430
of wavelengths we can't see but mobile phone cameras

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.770
can. Try this at home. Push a button on a
remote control and you won't see much

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.470
but use a mobile phone camera
to detect wavelengths you can't see

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.680
and have them rendered visible.
There's a whole lot going on

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.290
we miss out on. Our night sky is full of

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.379
frequencies we can't see with our eyes alone

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.959
but Chromoscope.net allows you to extend

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.970
your vision.
This is the Milky Way as we see it,

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.970
the visible light it gives off. But slide

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.790
to see how it would look if our eyes
sensed other frequencies.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.519
Of course, we are having to represent
these other frequencies

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.580
with visible colours because even
electromagnetic pretend time

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.709
is bounded by our puny limits.

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.129
As for Earth, if we only saw infrared
frequencies it might look something

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.030
like this in our minds.
Ultraviolet and extreme

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.849
ultraviolet vision would return
unrecognizable spheres.

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.140
With X-ray vision auroras around the
poles would shine brightly

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.319
and gamma ray vision would give
Earth a bright edge

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.890
from high-energy electromagnetic
radiation hitting the atmosphere

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.050
at a shallow angle.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.420
So, which view is correct? Is there an

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.900
absolute true appearance of the Earth?

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.920
We haven't even started yet.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.950
Look back at the Blue Marble.
What's with the tyranny 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.370
of "north" meaning "up"? Perhaps,

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.459
it's because we often equate "up" with "better"

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.599
and many early map makers were from
North of the equator.

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.930
But upside-down maps are equally true,

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.110
no matter how strange day may seem to us.
Funny enough,

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.280
the famous Blue Marble itself is a
product of North equals

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.129
up bias. It didn't originally look like this.

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.439
The crew of Apollo 17 originally took it

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.859
like this. NASA rotated it to

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.620
fit our traditional idea of up after the fact.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.620
Here's a visual birth that comes from
the US Naval Observatory's live

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.770
animation of our planet.
You can see exactly what parts are

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.889
in its shadow at this very moment.
Other shadows fall

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.449
on Earth as well, like the Moon's shadow.

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:43.400
Last week @BadAstronomer shared this
image. The dark smudges on the left is

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.090
actually

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.699
the Moon's shadow during a Solar Eclipse

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:51.830
as seen from above Earth.
There's another problem with

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.310
the Blue Marble - it's flat and the Earth

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.060
is three-dimensional.
A  globe is the best way to represent the Earth

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.720
but globes are difficult to carry around
and even when displayed in two

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.840
dimensions,

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.000
well, you just can't see everything at once.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.389
A flat map of the Earth is really convenient

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.759
but requires projecting a globe onto something

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:20.289
flat. And a sphere's surface cannot be
represented on a plane

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.410
without distortion.
The West Wing famously pointed out

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.930
the limitations of flat maps.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.500
There's no such thing as a perfect flat map of the entire

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.380
world. Some maps are useful for some
things and other maps for other things

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.039
but it is really fun to pick on the Mercator projection,

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.880
mainly because it's so popular and is
even used by Google Maps,

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.930
mainly because it's so easy to zoom in on.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.810
It preserves shape decently well but suffers

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.650
when it comes to area. As I've shown before, Africa

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.889
is huge. Its area is so large the
entire contiguous United States could

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:03.150
fit inside of it, along with all of China,

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.860
India, Japan and much of Europe.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.370
But on the Mercator projection scale near the poles

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.610
is pretty wonky, distorted, which means

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.060
Greenland appears to be as large as Africa,

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.060
even though in reality it is only 1/14th

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.500
the size. There's more.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.830
Check out Alaska and Brazil on a
Mercator projection. They appear almost

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.229
the same size but in reality Brazil

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:37.110
is nearly five times bigger than Alaska.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.460
Areas near the equator are minimized, whereas

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.740
areas closer to the poles are exaggerated.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.250
To have fun with this problem, play the Google Maps

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.900
Mercator puzzle. The red pieces are
countries projected outside of their

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.530
usual

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.849
locations. Now, what the heck is this

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:00.220
weird shape? Well, let's pull it away from
the North Pole, where scale is distorted

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:00.710
a lot

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.030
and now it's Australia.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.620
You can see how the math behind map
projections distort Earth

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.639
by interacting with them on Jason Davies'

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:14.960
brilliant site. Notice how small
Greenland appears on the Mercator

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.240
projection when pulled down to the

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.069
equator and how exaggerated it becomes 
when moved to the edge.

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:25.240
To be fair, the Mercator projection is great for navigation.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.919
If you want something that is more fair
when it comes to area,

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:32.169
try the Gallâ€“Peters. Here,

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:35.470
landmasses are the right relative size

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.509
but shape is sacrificed. Everything looks a bit

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:40.529
too narrow.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.880
Enter the Mollweide. This projection shows

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:49.069
equal areas and is a bit more pleasant shape-wise.

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:53.479
If you interrupt the Mollweide around
the oceans, relative area is preserved

00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:56.740
and the shape of land masses becomes even more

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:01.280
accurate. When it comes to the shortest
route between two places on the surface

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.729
of the Earth, Gnomonic projections are really cool.

00:08:05.729 --> 00:08:10.910
Every straight line journey taken on
Earth's surface is actually part of a great

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:15.379
circle. On Mercator projections actual straight line paths

00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:18.479
look curved. But every straight line

00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:22.080
on a Gnomonic projection is also a straight line

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.449
in real life - the shortest route. If you want

00:08:25.449 --> 00:08:29.970
a compromise between shape and area,
you might try the pleasant

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:34.229
Winkel tripel, which the
National Geographic Society has used for maps it

00:08:34.229 --> 00:08:35.060
produces

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.529
since 1998. Or a beautiful butterfly map

00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:43.260
that could be a ball until it's
flattened, say, under a pane

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.700
of glass. The Dymaxion map can unfold

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.350
to show how nearly connected Earth's landmasses

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:54.570
are. It's a great way to visualize human migration

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:58.610
overtime. It's quite impressive how far and wide

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:03.060
humans have traveled on earth,
but it remains a bit of a disappointment

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.180
to realize just how narrow our slice

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.410
of visual perception really is.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.490
But don't feel bad.
This brings us to the story of

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.110
Julian Bayliss.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.360
Yes, hello, is this doctor Julian Bayliss?

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:17.690
[ON THE PHONE:] Yes, speaking.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.769
Bayliss told me about how
one day, while using Google Earth, he

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:23.570
spotted some dark green vegetation.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.779
It looked like a rain forest.
An expedition was scheduled

00:09:27.779 --> 00:09:31.089
and it turned out to be just that - a rain forest

00:09:31.089 --> 00:09:34.769
we had previously never seen. I asked him more.

00:09:34.769 --> 00:09:36.609
So, what have you found there?

00:09:36.609 --> 00:09:39.440
[ON THE PHONE:]
That day we found about 12 new species

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.910
just from Mabu.
So we found about 3 snakes, 2 chameleons and

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:47.449
about 4 butterflies, 2 new species of plants

00:09:47.449 --> 00:09:50.920
and we've only really just been into the
forest edge. So, I read, read a paper

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.629
the other day, a scientific paper.
They estimate that there's maybe 8 million,

00:09:54.629 --> 00:09:58.999
8.5 million species in this world
but we've only actually discovered

00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:03.119
1.5 million or between 1.5 and 2 million.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:08.540
So, we've actually only discovered maybe one fist of everything that's living on this

00:10:08.549 --> 00:10:09.089
planet.

00:10:09.089 --> 00:10:12.809
Wow, our eyes only see

00:10:12.809 --> 00:10:15.860
a tiny fraction of what there is to see.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.839
But within that tiny fraction there are still

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:24.739
an enormous number of things left to find.
So keep searching, keep looking.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.540
[ON THE PHONE:]
And as always,

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.640
thanks for watching.
