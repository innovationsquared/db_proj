Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:08.380
And this strawberry weights about 50 grams, which
according to Russell Seitz also happens to

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.380
be the weight of the entire Internet.
What does that mean?

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.310
I mean, the Internet is a gigantic place and
how do you measure information?

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.769
Well, let's start a little bit smaller with
a Kindle.

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.179
Right now, I'm reading Gadsby, which is a
great novel that makes complete sense, except

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.839
it was written without ever using the letter
"e," which is awesome.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.720
But when I put Gadsby on my Kindle, did my
Kindle gain weight?

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.600
Well, theoretically, yes it did.
Information is stored on flash drives like

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.880
this and on my Kindle in binary.
And that binary physically exists because

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.680
electrons charge floating gate transistors.
And the thing about electrons is that they

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.240
have mass.
In fact, a professor at Berkeley estimated

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.700
that when a Kindle is completely full of books,
its weight increases by about 10 to the negative

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.550
18th grams.
That number is mind blowingly miniscule.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.110
In fact, he says that when you fully charge
a Kindle's battery, it gains 100 million times

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.870
more mass than it does when you fill it with
books.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.800
But even then the number is impossible to
measure.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.530
The most specific scales we've ever created
only measure to about 10 to the negative 9th

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.300
grams.
So let's get bigger.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.070
Russell Seitz came up with his measurement
because the Internet is composed of networks

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.560
of servers and they're about 75 to 100 million
servers operating to make the Internet work.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.260
Combined, that many servers equal about 40
billion Watts of electricity and we know that

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.240
an Amp is about 10 to the 18th electrons per
second.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.940
And since we know the weight of an electron
we can calculate that the entire Internet

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.710
is really just about 50 grams of electrons
in motion.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.810
Now that number only includes servers.
And Seitz says that if you wanna include the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.060
chips in personal computers as well, the number's
about 3 times larger.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.120
But there's a weight of the Internet that
impresses me a little bit more.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.780
It's a calculation not of the energy it takes
to serve the Internet, but the energy contained

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.440
in the actual information.
The videos, the pictures, the e-mails.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.640
How much do they all collectively weigh when
stored?

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.349
Well, here's the thing.
It takes about 8 billion electrons to store

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.789
one e-mail.
8 billion sounds like a lot, but electrons

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:36.480
are tiny and so one e-mail only weighs about
two ten-thousandths of a quadrillionth of

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.700
an ounce.
But the Internet contains lots of e-mails

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.400
and it contains lots of video and images and
celebrity rumours, so how much does it weigh

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.660
altogether?
Well, the first question we have to ask is

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.320
how big is the Internet and that's difficult
to calculate, but Eric Schmidt, then-CEO of

00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:00.420
Google, once estimated that the entire Internet
contains about 5 million Terabytes of information,

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.730
of which, he said, Google has only indexed
0.004%.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.880
Okay, so not counting the energy it takes
to deliver the Internet, the information itself

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.900
on the Internet is about 5 million Terabytes.
Now, we know how many electrons it takes to

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.290
form a single byte and we know the mass of
an electron and so with a little bit of math

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.920
you can figure out that the entire Internet,
everything on it, collectively only weighs

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.700
0.2 millionths of an ounce.
Think of it this way: every single video on

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.720
YouTube, every single video across the entire
web, every single image, every single website,

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.140
every e-mail you've sent, every love
letter you've written, every photo of your

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.849
grandkids you've received is collectively
held within an amount of mass about the size

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:54.879
of the smallest possible grain of sand.
If you follow @tweetsauce on Twitter you can

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.859
learn even more.
I'm gonna share some more facts there that I didn't

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.980
include in this video around electricity in
general.

And as always,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.420
thanks for watching.
