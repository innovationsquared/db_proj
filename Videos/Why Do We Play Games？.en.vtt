Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.540
Why do humans play games?
Whether it's a video game or a board

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.680
game or a physical game, like soccer - or football.
I don't have to put the ball in

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.420
the net to survive, and, even if I did, why
would I invite a goalie and another team?

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.180
Games are weird. This lead Bernard Suits to
say in the 70's that a game is a voluntary

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:36.140
attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.
So, why do we play sports and games? How should

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:45.300
we feel about intellectualism vs. athleticism?
But, most importantly, why do Americans call

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:51.410
this game soccer while the English, and the
rest of the world, call it football?

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:59.180
It turns out that the word "soccer" doesn't
come from the United States of America. Instead,

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.180
the blame for the word goes to the British
themselves, specifically Oxford, where, since

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.219
1875, it has been popular to add the suffix
"-er" to the end of words. For example, calling

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:19.130
Radcliffe Camera the "Radder,"
or these "fivers" and "tenners."

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.869
We have been playing games with balls and
our feet ever since ancient times, all over

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.659
the world. In fact, as recently as 200 years
ago, many of these games called themselves

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.530
"football." A lack of standardization meant
that it was difficult to all come together

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.829
and agree on what you could and couldn't do
with the ball or your feet. But, luckily,

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:47.429
in 1863 the Football Association was founded
in London, England. Association football is

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:54.109
what we most commonly mean nowadays when talking
about football, or soccer. But what's the connection

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:58.999
if the Oxford "-er" was added to Association
football, shouldn't we be calling the game

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:05.139
"Association-er?" Well, let's take a closer
look at the word "association." You see what's

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:08.119
hiding in there? There she is. "Soccer."

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:15.120
But we're getting ahead of ourselves because
soccer, football, is just one type of game.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:21.780
Ultimately, what is a game? Well, one of my
favorite ways of defining "game" comes from

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.430
computer game designer Chris Crawford.
Let's begin with a book. This is a great book, it's

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.629
really fun, it's entertaining, but it's not a game.
TV shows and movies are also not games

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:39.599
because, fundamentally, they aren't interactive.
But as soon as something is both fun and

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.470
interactive, well, now we've got ourselves
a play-thing. There are two types of play-things,

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.319
according to Crawford. If you can play with
the object and it's fun but there's no goal

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:56.659
or objective associated with it, it's a toy.
If, however, there is an objective, something

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.610
you're supposed to accomplish, well, now you're
talking about a challenge. But there are two

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.530
different types of challenges. If the challenge
involves no other people or other agents,

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.569
it's just you, for instance, playing alone
with a Rubik's Cube, you've got yourself a

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.920
puzzle. If, however, there are other people
involved, well, now we've got ourselves a

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.360
conflict.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.799
In a conflict, like a foot race, you aren't
allowed to interfere with the other participants.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.430
This is what Crawford calls a "competition."
If, however, you are allowed to interact with

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.250
and interfere with the other players and
they can do the same to you, well, in that

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.799
case, we are talking about a full-fledged game.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.680
So, a game is interactive, goal-oriented,
and involves other agents, for instance, other

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:52.480
people who can interfere with and influence
each other. Which means, technically speaking,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:00.579
that life is a game. I mean, real life.
My life, your life, easily fit many definitions

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:07.079
of "game." And, in life, there are games that
we tend to call "sports." Now, competency

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:14.199
at sports can divide humanity into two groups.
Jocks, who are good at sports, and nerds

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:21.459
who aren't. Jocks are literally named after
the Jock Strap, which keeps your genitals

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.810
supported while being athletic.
But jocks are cool, right? They're fit, attractive,

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.639
they get invited to all the cool parties where,
in high school, they can do dangerous, cool

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:37.660
things like get drunk. And who are you if
you don't get drunk? Well, what's the word

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:44.660
"drunk" backwards? You are a "Knurd."
But that's not the origin of the word "nerd."

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.840
There's much debate about where the word comes
from, but what we do know is that it emerged

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.900
as a slang term for "lame" or "square" in
Detroit in the early 1950's.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.060
The first known use of the word in print came
from Dr. Seuss himself and, fundamentally,

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.970
it may come from the word "nut," which meant
a crazy person, and was later altered to "nert,"

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.220
and, finally, "nerd." It exists today as a word
for un-athletic people largely because it

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.600
was popularized through its frequent use on
the US TV show "Happy Days."

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:26.820
Whether your spend your time on athletic pursuits
or intellectual pursuits, or both, games,

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:33.430
in some form, are a part of your life.
So, why do we play games?

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.940
Humans, and many other

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:42.349
animals, play. And, perhaps, "play" originated
as a way of physically preparing our bodies

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:48.190
for life's real challenges later on. That
idea makes sense, but the evidence isn't convincing

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:56.110
because, in the wild, "play" can often lead
to a wasting of precious resources, injuries

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.990
and hardly comes close to simulating real
attacks and life-threatening situations.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.920
The New York Times wrote a great article about
this conundrum, pointing out that physically

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:13.930
preparing the body may be less of a priority
for "play." Instead, the point of "play" might

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:21.310
be preparing the brain. Play is good for the
brain, especially during formative, juvenile

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:27.160
years, when most of us have an instinctive urge
to goof around, play and pretend anyway.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:33.199
Young rats confined to cages with adult rats,
who refused to play with them, grew up with

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:39.300
smaller, less developed brains. This has led
to the hypothesis that games play a role in

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.819
the development of certain brain structures,
especially the cerebellum when we are young.

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:49.440
But, to be clear, the evidence does not show
that play is vital for the development of

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.990
these regions. Other methods, like exercises
or teaching, may have a similar effect.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:01.190
They might not be as fun, but this is known
as equifinality. So there's debate as to just

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:08.770
how vital play and games really are.
Well, let's take a look at the rewards that games

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:09.930
give us.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:17.220
In the first half of the 20th century, Abraham
Maslow constructed a hierarchy of human needs.

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:21.900
The concept is popular in developmental psychology
as a way of thinking about human growth and

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:27.789
what motivates us to do things or to not
do things. In general, until the needs of

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:33.539
a lower tier are fulfilled, an individual
can't move on to fulfilling higher ones. For

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:39.310
instance, achieving confidence, or satisfying
the desire to learn and explore, aren't important

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:46.139
to a person in fear for their life and safety.
Play might be motivated by higher needs. Animals

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:51.150
play, but as we've seen in nature, not the
ones who are stressed or starving.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:56.889
The thing is, lower needs tend to be pretty
clear cut. If I'm hungry and I eat what I

00:07:56.889 --> 00:08:02.870
need, I'm done. It's not that complicated.
But, as creatures and brains and cultures

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:09.409
become more complicated, so do their needs
and the behaviors required to fulfill them.

00:08:09.409 --> 00:08:14.259
This brings us back to the fact that life
itself fits Chris Crawford's definition of

00:08:14.259 --> 00:08:22.159
a game. Arguably, life is the largest and
most complicated game on Earth. But playing

00:08:22.159 --> 00:08:28.750
your life usually isn't as easy as simply
remembering to eat and drink and breath.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:36.620
In life, knowing what the correct next move
is isn't always easy. Feedback is rarely immediate.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:42.339
I don't know if the choices I made were the
best, most perfect choices for me until way

00:08:42.339 --> 00:08:49.039
after I've made them, if even then.
Is this person, or city, or career right for me?

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:54.760
In life, the rules are complicated, the goals
are indeterminate and the methods for achieving

00:08:54.760 --> 00:09:00.390
them are often unknown or different for every
single person. Plus, the rewards themselves

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.770
are often slow to come or non-existent.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:09.320
So, in the face of all of that, it's no surprise
that we invented games within the larger game

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:16.600
of life itself that ensure fast, easy-to-achieve
and understandable rewards.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:23.240
Animals play too, but the complexity of rules
humans follow in their games, in many ways

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:29.399
reflect the complexity of the needs we find
ourselves able to pursue.

00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:34.159
In life, I don't always know the right choice.
I don't know the right job to apply for.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:40.480
How to explain something to a child. How to best help my friends or when to call my mom.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:48.579
But in Bomberman, I know exactly what every power-up
does, every time, all the time.

00:09:48.579 --> 00:09:54.120
In poker, a royal flush beats two-of-a-kind,
no question about it. Couldn't be more clear.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:10:01.500
But in my life, is an acquaintance or colleague
really on my side? Well, in team sports there's

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.200
no unknown, everyone is color-coded.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:11.760
Games and sports are a phenomenal way to feel
the rewards we need, without all of the unknowns

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:18.570
of life. Even watching games and sports, merely
being a spectator, can fulfill some of Maslow's

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:24.660
needs. I can feel a sense of belonging by
supporting a team, and by supporting a team,

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.700
their successes can kind of become my successes.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:34.820
What a great way to get respect without doing
a lot of work. It's known as BIRG-ing: Basking

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:41.070
In Reflected Glory. The opposite is CORF-ing:
Cutting Off Reflected Failure. If a team is

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:46.180
disgraced, I can easily say I was not really
ever that big of a fan anyway.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:52.560
BIRG-ing and CORF-ing extend beyond sports.
We BIRG and CORF workplace projects, school

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:59.399
projects, celebrities, election candidates.
The point is, life is a game, but winning

00:10:59.399 --> 00:11:08.019
and losing are nebulous. So, we invented simpler
games to provide psychological rewards faster

00:11:08.019 --> 00:11:14.029
and more efficiently than life itself does.
Which is why, at their darkest, games can

00:11:14.029 --> 00:11:16.839
lead to procrastination or addiction.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.579
But don't fear. You have the potential to
become a jock at the game of life, it's just

00:11:22.579 --> 00:11:28.300
not always that fun. And whenever you play
man-made games, rest assured that it's simply

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:35.110
because you, and all of us, are able to pursue
the fulfillment of needs higher than any other

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:36.590
creature on Earth.

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:37.610
And as always,

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.050
thanks for watching.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.080
Oh, and if you want some soccer science, why
not check out my video with Copa90, 

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.140
where we investigate

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:58.120
whether or not it's possible to kick a football
with so much spin that it not only curves,

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:00.790
but boomerangs back to the kicker.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:02.780
Okay, bye.
