Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:14.700
Fear gives us life.
Being afraid of the right things kept our

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:23.820
ancestors alive. It makes sense to be afraid
of poisonous insects or hungry tigers, but

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.780
what about fear when there is no clear and
obvious danger?

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.320
For instance, a Teddy Bear

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:43.360
with a full set of human teeth...or a smile.jpg.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.039
There's something a little off about these

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.049
images. Too much mystery, and strange-ness,
but no obvious threat, the way there is with

00:00:53.049 --> 00:01:00.049
a gun or falling rock. But, yet, they still
insight fear, because they are creepy.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.800
But why? What gives us the creeps? 
What causes something to be creepy?

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.980
We are now in my bedroom, the bedroom I grew
up in, in Kansas. Like a lot of children my

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.030
age, I was terrified of "Scary Stories to
Tell in the Dark." But the very first book

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.600
that ever scared me was "The Curse of the
Squirrel." To this day, I still haven't finished

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.830
the book...but that's just me.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.030
Psychologist James Geer developed the "Fear
Survey Schedule II," which he used to find

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.070
out what scared us the most. Combined with
the results of a more recent Gallup poll,

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:51.300
these are the things that scare most of us,
the most. All of these things are scary, but

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.600
are they creepy? Let's get more specific.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.180
I love the way Stephen King delineates three
types of scary stuff. The first is the "gross-out".

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:09.440
This is something disgusting, morbid, diseased.
The second is "horror". Horror, to King, is

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.440
the unnatural: a giant spider, or being grabbed
in the dark when you thought you were alone.

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:26.629
The third, "terror," is different, creepier.
He says terror is coming home to find that

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:36.649
everything that you own has been replaced with
an exact copy. Terror is feeling something

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.400
behind you. It's breath on your neck. Knowing
that you will be grabbed, but then turning

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:49.600
around to find that there was never anything
there in the first place. Not a lot of research

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:56.609
has been done on that feeling, the creeps.
But many theories and ideas involve vagueness,

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:04.769
ambiguity.
For instance, masks, and why clowns are creepy.

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:11.379
Claude Levi-Strauss wrote that the facial
disguise temporarily eliminates from social

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:17.499
intercourse the part of the body, which reveals
personal feelings and attitudes. Part of the

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:24.499
reason even a neutral or happy mask can be
creepy may have to do with ambiguity. A mask

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:30.169
hides the true emotions and intentions of
the person underneath. I don't know if the

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:36.400
person wearing that mask is a threat or not.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:43.600
Vagueness is creepy when it comes to the human
form. This is the famous Uncanny Valley.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.280
On a chart of humanness, there's a zone where
something can be almost entirely human, but

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.980
off by just a little. Not so wrong that it's
clearly fake or funny, or so good that it's

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.109
indistinguishable. Instead, it's just troubling.

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:09.709
The creepiness of the Uncanny Valley is wonderfully
demonstrated by John Bergeron's Singing Androids.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.460
Watch these videos when you're alone.

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:22.679
A similar, uneasy feeling comes from ShayeSaintJohn,
a character created by Eric Fournier. Funny

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.520
to some, nightmare fuel to others.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.160
Uncanny humanoids, like all creepy things,
straddle a line between two regions that we

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.590
can understand and explain with language.
Francis T. McAndrew and Sara Koehnke describe

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:47.590
being "creeped out" as an adaptive human response
to the ambiguity of threats from others.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:54.240
Creepy things are kind of a threat maybe,
but they're also kind of not. So, our brains

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.910
don't know what to do. Some parts respond
with fear, while other parts don't, and they

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:06.710
don't know why. So, instead of achieving a
typical fear response, horror, we simply feel

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:18.270
uneasy, terror, creeped out. Between the mountains
of safety and danger, there is a valley of

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:24.840
creepiness, where the limits of our knowledge
and trust and security aren't very clear.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:36.400
Will looking at this cause you to die one
week later? Impossible, right? Maybe that's

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.820
the terror of ambiguity.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:47.500
We don't do well with ambiguity. When it involves
our own intentions, it can make us lie. And

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:53.320
when it involves danger, but no recognizable
threat, it can make us think and feel some

00:05:53.320 --> 00:06:00.180
pretty weird things. Have you ever peered
over a ledge, a railing, way high up, like,

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:07.200
so high up it made you nervous and dizzy
and felt something pushing you? Maybe even

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:15.380
an urge to jump? Have you ever stood on the
ledge with a loved one and realize that you

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:23.800
could push them? It would be that easy.
You really could do it, and maybe you do want

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:31.220
to do it, or maybe it's just cognitive dissonance.
The fact that your brain is having to deal

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.830
with ambiguity.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.930
A recent study by Jennifer Hames at Florida
State University dubbed this the High Place

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:45.000
Phenomenon. When approaching a ledge and a
dangerous drop, your survival instinct kicks

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.470
in and you pull yourself away. But, your balance
and motor systems don't get it. Nothing is

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:57.970
pushing you and you don't normally fall or
leap randomly. So, what's going on? The part

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:03.960
of your brain that processes intention might
resolve this by determining that something

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:11.520
must be pushing you. Or, that you might actually
want to jump or push your friend, even if

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.800
none of that is true.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:20.360
Now, we're not done with ambiguity yet because
our language reflects the gray area of terror

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:28.710
and creepiness. Take a look at the word "terror"
itself. We have "horrible" and "horrific."

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:36.710
"Terrible" and "terrific." Why is that?
Well, through history, we never really figured out

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:43.710
what to call powerful experiences, because
they're both. They are full of awe...awesome.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:53.960
And, they are full of aw...awful. We need
them to survive. We need fears and the creeps,

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:59.860
to understand our size, our weaknesses.
But, on the other hand, avoiding them is pretty

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:06.800
great too...The creeps is a physical reminder
that the world is vague and full of ambiguity,

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:13.800
but that we are cunning, always trying to
figure things out but, nonetheless, fragile.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:24.540
Is that terrible or terrific? Well, it's both.
Which, as a creepy ghost would say, is kind

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.170
of boo-tiful.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.700
And as always,

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.900
thanks for watching.
