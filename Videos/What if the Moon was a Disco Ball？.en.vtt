Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. If we turned

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:09.120
the Moon into a giant disco ball,

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.260
day and night would not

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.359
be a disco party. Instead of diffusely
reflecting sunlight onto

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.920
all of us, a mirror-tiled moon would reflect

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.910
specularly. You would be lucky to momentarily

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.470
catch a single reflected beam of sunlight.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.560
Now, with the help visuals by Nick from
Yeti Dynamics, who you should subscribe to

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.500
immediately, let's see what would occur
if a disco ball moon actually happened.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.910
Here's the Earth with an imaginary
screen behind it, so we can track the

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.309
path of reflections

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.630
from a disco ball Moon. It's 3,012 mirror
tiles are ten kilometres thick

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.940
and between 100 and 150 kilometres

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.739
across. And, as you can see, the beams of sunlight they

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.300
reflect would only intersect with Earth briefly

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.700
and rarely - a few every month or so would
race past at more than 20,000 kilometers a second.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.860
From the surface of Earth, they'd just be
tiny flashes in the sky

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.310
0.1 percent as bright as the regular Sun

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.220
and would last a fraction of a second.
The Earth, Sun and Moon just

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.960
aren't an ideal locations for disco ball effects.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.320
But, if our disco ball moon was closer

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.500
and orbited earth not 384,000 kilometers away but

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.640
less than 450, as far as the
International Space Station does,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.680
it would be torn apart by gravitational

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.140
title forces. Shoot. Also, the Moon doesn't really

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.310
rotate from our perspective like a fun disco ball.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.820
It liberates, but it's starting to look
like instead of an awesome lunar party decoration,

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.740
a disco ball moon would just be a lunar party pooper.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.740
So, for the sake of investigation, let's
allow this disco ball Moon to not be torn apart

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.390
and allow it to spin in the sky. Now we're talking.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.229
Occasionally we would get glittery
reflections of a dimmer image

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.579
of the Sun. From the surface of Earth,

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:17.579
this is what we would see.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.170
You know, being able to see

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.780
Earth reflected is almost cooler. It's like being

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.520
a bacterium on a giant's face who's looking into a mirror.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.730
You can see the giant, but not yourself.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.410
It kinda makes you feel small.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.000
But it would be a great way to take planetary selfies.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.400
So, let's watch a mirror the width of the
Moon orbit as close as the ISS does.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.900
From the surface of Earth, it would look like this.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.820
The strobe lights around the edge, by
the way, are ten kilometres across.

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:24.980
Pretty cool.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.560
Now finally, let's take a look at the
Moon as a rotating disco ball from low orbit.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.840
The Moon is not a disco ball

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.960
and likely never will be. It's just

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.419
a diffuse source of illumination. But it's

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.259
illuminating in a different way to imagine
what would occur

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:41.699
if that actually happened.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.020
Woah.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.050
And as always,

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.730
thanks for watching.
