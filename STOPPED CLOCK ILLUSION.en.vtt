Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And today I've got a brand new episode

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:07.419
of Vsauce Leanback.
You can click this annotation

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:10.630
or the link at the top of the
description to start it and then you can

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.719
just lean back

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.049
and the autoplay playlist bring the
knowledge right to your brain.

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.210
As you already know, it doesn't really
work on mobile phones yet so wait until

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.019
you are in a better position to lean back.

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.550
In the meantime, let's get saccadic.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.550
No, not psychotic, saccadic,

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.830
referring to what is known as
a saccade, the quick

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.930
movements that our eyeballs make
when we move from one

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.340
object to the other. As you may remember
from a previous Leanback, some animals,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.450
like most birds,

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.450
cannot move their eyeballs. And so to look
from one thing to another they have to

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.080
move their head really really fast

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.470
and to keep the world from being blurry
when their bodies move, they have to keep

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.660
their heads completely stationary.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.850
But here's the neat thing about saccades.
When our eyes move,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.470
there's a quick blur between

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.390
one destination and the other. And that
blur is completely incomprehensible to

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.000
our brain.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.190
So what are visual system does is erase it

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.330
from our memory and instead replace that
little fraction of a second that our eye

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.460
moved during

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.760
with the very next thing we see.
This leads to a really amazing illusion

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.270
called

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.860
'The Stopped Clock Illusion."
You may have noticed this before

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.810
if you've ever been in a room with a
clock with a second hand, like in a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:24.570
classroom,

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.880
darting your eyes back and forth
waiting for class

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.320
to be out. Now here is what happens.
Right when you dart your eyes to the clock,

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.320
that very first second, that very first
movement of the second hand

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.000
that happens when your eyes reach it
seems longer

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.880
than every other second afterwards.
Look away from the clock

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.300
and then look.
And that first second will seem to linger,

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.490
as if time itself has stopped.
The reason for that

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.330
is that your brain replaces the time
it took for your eye to go from here

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.159
to the clock with an image of the
first thing you saw, which was the second-hand.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.650
And so, that little fraction of a
second of time is added

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.619
to length of time it takes the second-hand to
move. What's really mind-blowing about

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:09.229
this entire

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.680
effect is that it happens all the time.
All day,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.310
as you look around the world from one
point to another, that little fraction of

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.920
a second

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.090
that your eyeball was moving is lost
and your brain just replaces it with the very

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.610
next thing

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.110
that you see. Now, it might just be
a tiny tiny amount of time,

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.190
but over the course of an entire day
those little fraction of a second

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.250
add up to almost 40 minutes.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.770
40 minutes of everyday that you're awake
are lost

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.670
because our eyeballs move.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.920
And as always,

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.340
thanks for watching.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.300
So what are you waiting for,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.780
click here to start the Leanback or click
the link at the top of this

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.230
video's description.
You know what? I totally

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.150
never say this... Yeah, I'm totally heterosexual, but..
You are really attractive!
