00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.559
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. I am

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.960
distorted. The pixels you are watching have been

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.180
time displaced. They've been mapped onto a gradient

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.779
and the darker the region they're mapped to,
the further behind

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.590
they lag. The effect is really fun but it's certainly

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.590
not realistic. Or is it?

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.820
Many, many popular digital cameras suffer
from lag induced distortion,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.020
like what you just saw, though much,

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.460
much more subtle. Usually completely

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.710
unnoticeable. It's called a rolling shutter.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.790
Instead of snapping a full exposure at once

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.199
they quickly scan strips of each frame. It's

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.710
usually undetectable. But when the
subject changes faster than the camera

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.550
scans,

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.210
you get the famous geloey wobbly rolling 
shutter effect. Really fast

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.800
things, like vibrating guitar strings and
airplane propellers,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.710
are famous victims, but people can be too.
Luke Mandel submitted this photo

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.619
to Boing Boing[.net]. His camera scans left to
right and, in this instance,

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.210
managed to capture a blink, eyes closed

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.170
when the scan began and then open in the
reflection scanned a fraction

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.740
of a second later.
But the rolling shutter effect

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.700
is not just a neat curiosity. It represents

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.130
a fundamental and inescapable distortion that

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.710
affects everything we see. Rolling shutter

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.119
or not. First things first, let's talk about distortions.

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.409
A hallucination is a distortion of reality

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.390
when there is no apparent stimulus. If you are merely

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.700
misinterpreting an actual stimulus, that is an illusion.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.909
But some distortions occur before our sense organs

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.180
and minds get in the way. They are called

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.340
optical phenomena. They are not the
result of sensation or perception gone wrong.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.660
Instead, optical phenomena are distortions
caused by the mere properties of light

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.500
and matter

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.970
in and of themselves. If you look up at the sky

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.640
and see a giant vivid drinking gourd,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.900
you are hallucinating. But if you see a flat

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.000
two-dimensional connect-the-dots
Big Dipper, you are seeing

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.290
an illusion. It's an illusion because those dots merely

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.510
appear to be on the same plane, like
holes poked in the dark roof of the sky.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.609
In reality, those dots are stars

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.730
lightyears apart from one another in three dimensions.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.840
As Celestron's brilliant free real-time
3D visualization of space

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.440
shows, from different perspectives, besides our own,

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.410
they look a lot less like a dipper or plough.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.660
In fact, all constellations and asterisms

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.650
are geocentric illusions. From a wider perspective

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.730
their outlines point inward,

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.790
to the single lowly point in space

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.560
that gave them their names. But you can't blame us.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.400
I mean, Earth is the only perspective any
human has ever had.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.200
And even Voyager 1,
the most distant man-made object,

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.060
is still not even close to being far
enough away for the constellations to look

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.760
even remotely different than they do here on Earth.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.570
It's also not our fault, our eyes' and brains'

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.109
fault, that distant, distant stars weren't included

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.810
in our early cosmic connect-the-dot game.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.079
Sure, our eyesight could be better,

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.130
but optical phenomena are also to blame.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.350
If it weren't for red shifting and the
inverse square law and light extinction,

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.600
distant things could be seen in all their glory.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.820
The night sky would look phenomenal. Many structures

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.150
up there are huge. They're just

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.850
too dim for their hugeness to be appreciated.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.870
When we see Hubble Telescope images of
distant objects, like the Helix Nebula,

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.510
it's easy to think that, without a telescope to zoom in,

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.290
the object must just be a tiny point in the sky.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.419
But in reality, even though the Helix Nebula is

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.680
700 light years away, it's

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.160
3 lightyears across. If we could make the Helix Nebula

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.340
less dim, if our eyes could take a

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.729
really long exposure of it,
we would see the Helix Nebula

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.840
as it really is - nearly 70% the apparent diameter

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.380
of our Moon. This is a serious picture.
That is how large

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.800
the Helix Nebula would appear in the
night sky from Earth

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.360
if it just wasn't so dim. Our Moon is

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.200
tiny in the sky, by the way. It's easy to
think of the moon as this huge

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.910
baseball-sized thing up there in the sky,
but that's an illusion.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.960
Try this the next time you see the
Moon. Grab a sheet of notebook paper

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.300
and you will notice that the angular
diameter of the Moon

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.840
is the same size as a hole punched in a
sheet of notebook paper held

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.880
in arms-length away. Seriously, try it
sometime. It shows just how

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.620
cute and tiny our little moon is.
The Orion Nebula

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.100
would appear even larger, if we saw all of its light.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.180
And the Andromeda Galaxy? Just

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.970
a smudge in the sky to our eyes. But if our
eyes were better at collecting

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.420
dim light, we would see Andromeda's true extent

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.690
in our sky. Of course, our

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.720
night sky doesn't look like that. Distant objects

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.520
are dimmer, that's a bummer. But light still
wins when it comes to speed.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.320
Light travels at the fastest speed.
In fact, in a vacuum, light travels

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.970
300,000 kilometres a second.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.400
That's fast.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.630
But not really. I mean, not compared to how far apart

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.200
things are in the universe. Sydney, Australia

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.280
is 1/14th of a light second away from London.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.920
But the Andromeda Galaxy is

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.540
2,500,000 light years away from London.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.830
To put that in perspective let's take a
light speed journey from London

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.810
to Sydney. It would look like this... Ready?

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.550
Three, two, one, go!

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.230
Nice! Alright, alright. Here's the Andromeda Galaxy.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:40.520
Okay, now, relativistic effects aside,
let's take a look at what it would look

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.180
like to travel toward the Andromeda Galaxy

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.020
at the speed of light. Are you ready? Alright.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.540
Three, two, one, go!

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.440
Yeah. I mean, seriously, it's

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:01.350
pretty lame. Even at the speed of light,

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.230
the fastest speed possible, a year from now

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.000
we won't even be a millionth of the way there.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.320
That's how far away

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.980
Andromeda is. It's almost sad

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:20.290
in a way. But this brings us back to
the rolling shutter effect.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:25.960
The Andromeda Galaxy is huge. It's more
than a hundred thousand light years across

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.590
and our view of it is tilted.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.820
Which means that, on the plane we view it in,
light from the back

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:39.240
represents what Andromeda looked like
thousands and thousands of years before

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.330
what light from the front represents.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.690
Changes in its appearance reach us 
sooner from the front

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:50.270
than from the back. Andromeda is rotating,
spinning at hundreds of kilometers per

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.910
second in some places.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.670
Now, a lag between light coming from near

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.880
and far points on a spinning object, results

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.690
in a skewed image. The rolling shutter
effect on a cosmic scale

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.700
applied to, say, a chessboard, seeing the front

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.410
ahead of the back is pretty trippy and dramatic.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.780
So, does that mean we see

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:18.200
wobbly, funhouse mirror, rolling
shutter effect versions of Andromeda

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.670
and other distant galaxies? Well, technically

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:26.660
yeah, but the distortion is negligible. It may as well be

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.020
ignored. Why? Well,

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.670
the speeds used in these visualizations are not

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:38.250
to scale. On average, yes, matter within galaxies

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.700
orbits the galactic center at hundreds
of kilometers per second

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.560
but galaxies are so huge it takes them

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.210
hundreds of millions of years to complete just one

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:53.740
rotation. In other words, the lag between light

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.000
reaching you from near and far points on a galaxy,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.290
is nothing compared to how much time it takes

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.860
matter in the galaxy to travel that same distance.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.990
In the case of Andromeda, if you insisted

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.380
on seeing Andromeda as it really is,

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:15.560
that is, corrected for any lag caused by
the fact that the speed of light is

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.800
finite, the most extreme points on the Galaxy

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.040
would only need to be adjusted by about a 10,000th of

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.420
the width of any image. In this case, less than a pixel.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.800
So, it's not a big deal. But it's not a nothing deal.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.530
It's real. In fact, everything we look at is,

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.670
in some way, distorted by the fact that the speed of light

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.750
is finite. Your own feet are about

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:47.140
5 to 6 light nano seconds away from your
eyes, which means when you look at your feet

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.950
you are seeing where they were 5 to 6

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:55.230
nano seconds ago. 5 to 6 nanoseconds in the past.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:58.250
Of course, a delay that brief is pretty
much undetectable

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.880
but it is calculate-able. If it makes you feel

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.220
a little sad to know that even with the sharpest mind

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.550
or the best instruments, appearances still depend on

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:13.140
where you are. That optical phenomena insure

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:17.680
appearances are always relative(?) Don't feel bad.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.670
We call the people closest to us our relatives.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.070
We're really just a family, a big family

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:28.480
of reference frames that,
like a family, don't always agree

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.570
but do have plenty of cool things to look at.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:35.490
I'd like to thank my editor, Guy, for help with the

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:37.930
rolling shutter effect in this video.

00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:54.449
And I'd like to thank you, because, as always

00:10:54.449 --> 00:10:57.069
thanks for watching.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:23.010
Oh, here's something cool.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.040
I will be at YouTube Fan Fest with HP

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.580
in India very very soon. Check the
description for more info. If you can

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.070
make it,

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:31.020
I hope to see you there.
