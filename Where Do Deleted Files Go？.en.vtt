00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:03.540
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
But now

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.300
I'm not. I'm gone like 90% of
the original silent films

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.009
ever made.
Six of the seven wonders of the ancient world

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.539
deleted, like that text you thought twice about sending

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.920
or a Snapchat photo, right?

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.439
When Stalin decided that Trotsky was
an enemy of the state,

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.269
he had Trotsky removed from photos he appeared in

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.160
with Lenin.
Plenty of software tools and professional services

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.329
allow you to do the same.
Don't just

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.370
forget the actual attendees of a moment in time,

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.149
delete them.
But where do things go

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.800
when they're deleted?

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.030
The Google Ngram Viewer allows you
to search words and phrases

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.699
in 5.2 million books published between 1500

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.329
and 2008.
It's a great way to see how

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.790
the words we use have changed overtime.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.640
1979 was a significant

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.360
year. According to the Ngram Viewer,
it was the first year we begin to use the

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.970
word

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.330
delete more often than the word

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.759
erase.
Biological deletion

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.929
still wins though. Forget is by far more
pervasive in our communication

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:26.649
but how does a computer forget?

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.649
Moving a file to the trash is just the beginning.

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.580
To protect against accidental deletion,
when thrown in the trash

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.110
a file remains on your computer in a
temporary directory, a sort of

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.610
purgatory, where it awaits a more
ultimate deletion but can be resurrected

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.200
if you wish.
When you empty the trash

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.270
you are warned that you cannot undo the action.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.930
But when you empty the trash, the physical space

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.409
inhabited by the file isn't actually emptied.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.909
It's marked as empty.
Available

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.210
if and when new data needs to be stored somewhere.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.250
The file's home has become available real estate

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.870
but the file itself hasn't moved out.
Only the pointers

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.730
have gone away. Pointers are another type
of data on your drive that point to

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.230
places in memory

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.239
where the actual file they are referencing
can be found.

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.730
They're a bit like the table of contents,
which means that on most

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.190
operating systems deleting a file and emptying the trash

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.329
is like deleting a chapter from a book

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.390
by turning to the table of contents and marking

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.079
the chapter as empty.
There's nothing here, do what you want with the pages.

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:46.489
To a computer reading the table of
contents it looks like the space is

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.470
empty but of course that doesn't change
the fact that the contents of the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.100
chapter

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.650
are still there.
Special data recovery tools

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.660
look through memory marked empty available

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.310
to see what's actually there.
If you're lucky,

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.579
they can even find a file and save it, bring it back

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.199
mark it not available, undeleted.

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:11.940
But if some of the file has already been overwritten,

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.730
there can be problems.
The file can be

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.769
corrupted, melded together with other
data like some kind of digital

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.239
Frankenstein's monster.
A couple years ago

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.549
a laptop that belonged to photographer
Melanie Willhide

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.859
was stolen.
It contained many of her recent digital photos.

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.669
Luckily, police were able to return the
laptop to her. They found it in a car they

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:36.489
pulled over,

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.900
but the thief had wiped the laptop's
hard drive clean and had been using it

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.419
for his own purposes.

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.600
Data recovery experts were able to find

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.040
some of her files, still there,
on the now-empty space,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.100
but the files had been slightly overwritten

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.299
by things the thief had done.
They'd been corrupted but in a

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.510
really cool way.
So cool Willhide decided to exhibit the work.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.870
She titled the show after the thief who made it possible,

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.959
"To Adrian Rodriguez, with love."

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.209
If you want to delete the file so completely

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.359
it can't even be recovered in a cool,
weird way, like Willhide's photos,

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:18.449
you will need to overwrite the unwanted file

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:22.030
completely.
Deny the file a proper burial

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.060
and rearrange its corpse with new data.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.850
One overwrite should be fine but some
people do as many as 35.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.410
Even 35 overwrites might not be enough.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.080
Sure, the overridden data is hidden, but what about bad

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.970
sectors? These are parts of a drive that
devices can't access

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.280
because of failed transistors or physical damage.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.479
An overwrite won't be able to reach them,
meaning any data that was ever put there

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:59.270
stays there. So, if you are the United
States Department of Defense and you

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.949
don't want to take any risks,

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.990
you will also shred, physically polarize

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.180
unwanted drives.
The US, Europe, Japan

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.750
often send such electronics waste to dumps

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.460
in Ghana, like this one.
This city in Ghana is known as

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.590
Earth's digital dumping ground.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.159
Why Ghana?
Well, it is cheaper to send

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:27.860
unsalvageable electronics to Africa,
marked as a donation,

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.669
than it is to properly recycle them.

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.770
But there, in these electronic dumps,

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.099
the files can still be brought back to life.

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:42.639
Organized criminals operating in Ghana
have managed to successfully recover

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:43.469
data

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:47.300
from unregulated e-dumps.
They've been able to find confidential

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.680
multi-million-dollar agreements, involving

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.069
the Defense Intelligence Agency, Homeland Security

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:56.759
and the TSA.
Shredding

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:01.330
paper to get rid of whatever used to be
on the paper isn't even safe

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.289
either. It's not easy and it doesn't
always work. But by scanning

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:11.120
shreds of paper computer software can
match the pieces together.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.169
But in the past, shredded documents 
have been unshred

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:21.219
by hand. In 1979 Iranian students seized
the US Embassy in Tehran.

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:25.050
With the help of local carpet weavers and
years of hard work,

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.180
they managed to reassemble thousands of
pages of confidential documents

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.719
shred by the CIA.
The smaller the shredded particles

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:37.020
are and the more of them there are,
the more difficult the task. So,

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.849
the Department of Defense requires that
the majority of shredded particles

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:45.849
not exceed 5 square millimetres.

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:49.319
If you really want to delete something, destroy it,

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:52.819
erase it, time is on your side.

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:55.860
In about 5.4 billion years

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.569
the Sun will become the ultimate shredder.

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:03.610
A red giant large enough to swallow earth whole.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.439
Everything will be fine for billions of years.

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:12.150
But many accepted models of the universe
predict that in 10 to the 100

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.460
years

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.779
whatever intelligence is left will
witness the universe's

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:21.099
dark era and its final

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:24.529
Heat Death, the end of the universe, the end of

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:27.639
any file or photo or memory of you

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:32.199
ever being accessed again.
Every time something happens

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:35.620
a little bit of energy is lost.
For instance,

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.590
friction through sound or heat.
That energy goes out into the universe a

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.529
little bit at a time, slowly

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:46.409
more and more.
Eventually, in a closed system,

00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:51.270
energy becomes homogeneous,
evenly distributed, the same

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.930
everywhere.
There's no gradient maximum

00:07:54.930 --> 00:08:00.189
entropy.
In a little glass of ice water it's pretty quotidian

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:03.559
but given enough time our entire universe

00:08:03.559 --> 00:08:09.080
may be no different. A gradient,
a difference in energy from one place to

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.199
another is necessary for

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:14.759
things to happen, for files to be created and read,

00:08:14.759 --> 00:08:19.529
for life to exist.
And in 10 to the 100 years

00:08:19.529 --> 00:08:22.689
there may not be any usable energy

00:08:22.689 --> 00:08:27.090
left.
In Isaac Asimov's short story "The Last Question"

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.349
humans are concerned about this.
As the story

00:08:30.349 --> 00:08:33.900
leapfrogs billions of years into the future,

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.690
their list of solutions doesn't get any longer

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:43.030
than none. So, if we think across a grand timescale

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:46.180
is cosmic deletion the freezing

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.550
of everything, heat death, all we have to look forward to

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.940
in this universe?

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.029
We went to the Moon.
We brought

00:08:57.029 --> 00:09:00.339
flags with us that we planted on the
Moon, representing a place

00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:04.010
on earth.
But those American flags on the Moon

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.410
are likely erased now,

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.890
their symbols and colors bleached by the
intense radiation of the Sun on the

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:12.760
lunar surface,

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.950
unfiltered by any atmosphere.
The flags are still there, we didn't

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.260
take them back with us but now day are

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:25.730
empty. White flags.
White flags representing our surrender

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:31.810
to the inevitability of deletion in the universe.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.820
But we, today, are preoccupied with

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.340
just the opposite.
What really saturates our language,

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.370
what we really seem to talk about is

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.780
creation.
Things happening, not

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.050
loss.
Compared to erase,

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.830
forget and delete, "make" practically

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.840
deletes deletion.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.860
The flags on the Moon are bleached

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.940
out but is that bleak?
Are they

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.750
deleted or blank, like a fresh

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:10.890
sheet of paper ready for new stories?
Really, it just depends on what you

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.120
make of it.
So thanks for making things.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.160
And as always,

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.640
thanks for watching.
