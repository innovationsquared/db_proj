00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:05.500
Hey, Vsauce.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.269
Michael here.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.420
right now, in America, there are 106

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.029
people named Harry Potter.
1 007

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.520
named James Bond and eight people

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.160
named Justin Bieber.
They're just

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.849
aren't enough names to go around.

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.960
There are more than 300 million people

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.360
in America but a hundred and fifty
thousand last names and five thousand

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.660
first names

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.230
is all you need to name 9 out of every

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.930
10 of them.
When are we gonna run out of names?

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.200
Perhaps it's already happened to you.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.690
If it hasn't, when?
Ten years, twenty years, a hundred, a thousand.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.770
When will someone with your exact name

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.989
become famous?
So famous in fact that your legacy

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.629
changes forever to just being not

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.740
the person people think of when
they hear your name.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.670
And for that matter, when will every reasonably
memorable pronounceable

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.979
band name or brand name be taken?

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.549
When will authors have no choice but to
just start reusing book titles?

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.130
According to Rovi Corp, owner of AllMusic.com,

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.130
the most used band name is 'Bliss',

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.970
followed in order by 'Mirage', 'One',

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.710
'Gemini', 'Legacy', 'Paradox'

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.850
and 'Rain'.
In the past when

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.409
fewer bands had already been created and
you couldn't just Google up

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.240
every single band, overlap was easier to
get away with

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.369
and one word band names were plentiful.
But now, after years and years and years

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:52.610
of

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.640
band formation, well, we have

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.539
'The Who', but we also have 'The What?',

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.530
'The Where', 'The When', 'The Why', 'The How'

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.780
and even 'The The'.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.340
In order to stand out now,
and have your own unique name,

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.680
you have to be a bit more creative.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.019
'O', 'Diarrhea Planet'

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.000
or 'Betty's Not a Vitamin', which, by the way,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.860
is no longer true.
Betty became a vitamin in 1994.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.920
What about Twitter handles or email addresses?

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.110
Have we already reached peak username?
We already find ourselves often having to

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.000
use abbreviations, initials, numbers or just

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.810
choosing something completely different.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.480
Will our children or our children's children

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.290
live in a world where the only remaining
Gmail addresses is

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.000
are just random strings of alphanumeric characters?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.650
Are we approaching a name crisis?

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.200
And if so, should we even call it a name crisis,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.880
lest we use up yet another precious name?

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.190
Maybe you already share your name with
someone famous.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.890
But if you don't, how long will it be until you

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.190
probably will?
I mean, new famous people are popping up all the time

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.490
faster now than ever before because of the
Internet and they are gobbling up

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.990
top Google search billing.
Maybe it won't happen until

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.710
long after you've been dead but
shouldn't the reservoir

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.260
names, not taken by notable people, eventually 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.350
run out?
Computer scientist Samuel Arbesman approximated

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.560
how many famous people there are alive today

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.640
and I think his calculation will be
helpful. You see, he points out that if we

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.350
allow

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.040
"famous" to simply mean "being notable enough
to have your own Wikipedia page",

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.410
well, because there are 700,000 living people

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.990
with Wikipedia pages right now,
that means one out of every 10,000 people on

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.930
earth today

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.620
are famous. Assuming at the least
that that proportion remains constant

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.350
since 255 people are born every minute,

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.459
that means every hour a future famous person

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.510
is born.
Their name destined to become primarily associated

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.650
with them, not everyone else who

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.680
shares their name.
All of those people will be relegated to

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.400
disambiguation or the post-nominal, 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.450
not the famous one.
Luckily, if you do the math, you'll find that even at a rate

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.570
of one future

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.440
famous person born every hour, it would still take

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.250
dozens of millennia for most of us to expect

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.360
a future famous person with our exact name to emerge.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.650
Plus names change.
New ones become popular,

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.130
others obsolesce, but for fun, let's
not focus on names we popularly

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.400
use and instead look at how many possible names

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.200
there can be.
The Social Security Administration allows up to 36

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.030
letters

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.340
for a complete name.
Now, including spaces,

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.960
27 letters filling 36

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.760
spots, with repetition allowed,

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.090
means

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.510
3  sextillion possible combinations.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.860
That's more than Earth has

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.440
atoms.
So let's refine

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.690
our limits.
How many pronounceable names

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.330
are possible?
For that, I say we look at what Randall Munroe,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.810
the author of the fantastic 'What If?' did
when asked about naming

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.780
stars.
If you want to give every single star

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.180
in the observable universe a unique but
pronounceable

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.870
English name, how long would the names have to be?

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.960
His approximation is really
fascinating. If we define

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.080
unpronounceable word as a word that
contains consonant-vowel

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.100
pairs, we can roughly figure that there
are about 105 different

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.920
such pair possibilities.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.270
105. That's not too much different from

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.140
99. So, funny enough,
there are about the same number of

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.820
consonant-vowel pairs possible as there are

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.430
two-digit numbers,

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.860
which means we could give every star in
the observable universe

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.140
a sayable unique name

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:39.060
with just 24 letters, the same number of
digits it would take to just

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.580
number all of them.
So, the bottom line is we may each have to give up

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.320
uniquely owning a word or name that's common

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.700
today, but the potential number of names
that can be made

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.550
is really hardy.
In fact, before we run out of those

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.690
our species will likely evolve to
communicate in a completely different

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:01.250
way.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.870
Also, names aren't

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.990
just labels.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.360
A name on a screen, a username,
a handle, a screen name

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.600
doesn't always act exactly like

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.360
its owner.
User names can travel

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.940
more quickly and more widely than
flesh-and-blood people

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.550
and do things that their puppeteers
wouldn't normally do

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.700
away from the keyboard.
It's called the

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.250
online disinhibition effect.
If you can't

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.220
see the people you're interacting with
and they can't see you,

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.590
you're all just online hiding behind
different names than usual,

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.670
why hold back?
I mean, clearly such a system can't be

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.930
serious business.
On the Internet

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:52.130
no one knows you're a dog.
Why be nice or

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:55.630
tell the truth?
The subreddit KarmaCourt

00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:00.880
investigates and uncovers people who may
think that the less face-to-face nature

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.450
of the Internet makes lies easier to get away with.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:08.300
Like this person, who posted an image
suggesting that they've been single

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.770
for a year but had users found out posted

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.520
three months earlier a picture of

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.990
my girlfriend's cat.
These behaviors aren't

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:21.440
just what humans do when they can be anonymous

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:27.389
or can hide behind different names,
these behaviors can also be caused

00:08:27.389 --> 00:08:32.729
by the names themselves.
Studies have found that the username you use

00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:36.039
can impact how you behave.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:40.279
Your own pre-existing stereotypes and
expectations of certain words,

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:44.200
shapes, colors can be confirmed by your behavior,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.180
in the same way that studies have found
NFL and NHL players

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.899
play more aggressively when wearing black uniforms.

00:08:51.899 --> 00:08:55.579
Studies have also found that the more sexualized

00:08:55.579 --> 00:08:59.880
an avatar is you make someone use,
the more conscious they will be

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.560
of their own body image.
And the more an avatar resembles you,

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.310
the more correlated you watching it exercise

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.360
is with you being more likely

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.660
to exercise more.
It's called

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.870
the Proteus effect.
The features of a

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.760
cyberspace version of yourself,
a username and avatar

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.820
can actually change you, the

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:30.290
meat space "IRL" you.
Usernames and avatars then

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.880
aren't just handles attached to us.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.000
Psychologically, we often interact with them

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.180
as if they're friends, distinct beings

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.339
we created. They help us out

00:09:44.339 --> 00:09:48.170
but they also can influence us,

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:52.640
egg us on, dare us to do things we
wouldn't normally do because they offer

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.690
us protection,

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:57.290
entertainment.
Some make us feel safe,

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.829
professional, funny, dangerous,

00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:04.269
attractive.
We want cool ones.

00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:07.370
The cool ones make us look cool.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.880
As we go about our daily lives and vie for

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.150
attention, we are more and more
frequently doing so

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:19.670
with another name and exclusively
through that name

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.400
only.
So, it becomes quite interesting that

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.760
we're not going to run out of them
anytime soon.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.440
In fact, they might run out of us first and

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.490
may, in many ways, run

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:34.290
us.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.740
And as always,

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.060
thanks for watching.
