00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.910
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. Love

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.980
and war are exactly alike. It is lawful

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.700
to use tricks and slights to obtain a
desired

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.160
end. But is all fair

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.160
in love and war? That's a good question,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.619
let's pencil it in for

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.350
this episode.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.160
Of course, pencil is not permanent. It can
be erased.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.470
It's not like whatever I write down is
being chiseled into granite.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.180
But pencil lead is made out of carbon

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.090
atoms organised into a structure called
graphite -

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.430
a nonmetallic mineral with some metallic
properties found naturally

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.580
in rocks, which means things written in
pencil,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.030
though erasable, are still technically
written

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.520
in stone. In video games

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.100
if the bad guys really wanted to stop
you, why did they walk around in such

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.640
predictable patterns?

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.000
Wouldn't their chances be better if they
just came right at you?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.110
There's a great name for this logic:

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.030
"mook chivalry". It's as if there's a sort of

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.860
unwritten Geneva Convention that applies
to fictional baddies

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.390
that respects not reality, or what would
make sense,

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.650
but instead the higher purpose of fun,

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.890
and a good story. But in real life

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.930
we aren't that much different from the
mooks.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.330
We construct voluntary obstacles in the
way

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.930
of even honourable goals, like truth, justice,

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.630
or right over wrong. Not all is fair

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.090
in love and war. And it's the exceptions
that make us who we are.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.270
Torturing your enemies to

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.820
get information from them, to demoralise them, or just for

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.170
fun has been a "might

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.600
is right" part of war since war began.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.960
But in the second half of the 19th
century, Henry Dunant,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.220
the founder of the Red Cross organized
an official moral code

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.380
of warfare - The Geneva Conventions, that
today

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.680
across it's now 4 conventions has been
agreed to be followed

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.300
by 196 nations. And since then

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.270
various other customs, codes and
principles have been established

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.580
totaling up into what may now be called
the "Rules

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.560
of war". Their enforcement is handled
by regional,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.660
national and international powers. Of course,

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.020
an unconcerned force would simply ignore
these rules

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.300
because the quickest route to victory is
the one full

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.470
of unfair advantages, but nonetheless

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.870
we treasure them. Try to, at least. And
believe that all

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.110
others should. The values they recognise

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.350
are telling. Things unrelated to military
necessity,

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.440
or valued in a sense, more greatly than
immediate victory

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.050
are protected. For instance, The
Environmental Modification Convention

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.610
prohibits controlling the weather and
using the

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.280
weather as a weapon against your
opponents. Before the convention

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.570
that happened. For example, during
Operation Popeye

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.140
US airplanes seeded rain clouds over
Vietnam

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.110
and successfully extended the monsoon
season by more than a month,

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.350
increasing rainfall by 30 percent - a move
that made enemy road surfaces muddy,

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.540
blocked by landslides, washed out, much

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.900
less passable. The laws of war protect
certain symbols.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.320
Parties or infrastructures bearing
symbols that indicate there are

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.160
only there to help, or are neutral,
culturally important buildings that

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.140
should be protected for posterity

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.860
are off limits.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.599
It's a violation of the laws of war

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.890
to attack such targets or to pretend to
be such targets

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.410
if your intentions are otherwise.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.300
That is called perfidy. A kind of
deception that involves

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.849
pretending to act fairly and honestly to
invite the confidence of an adversary,

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.450
only to then take advantage of that
trust, betray it

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.819
and kill, injure or capture.

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.049
If you do one of those three things
while pretending to be dead

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.200
or injured or surrendered or civilian or
a non-combatant,

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.139
well, that's a violation of the rules of war. Espionage

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.820
is allowed. But if caught, you can be

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.150
prosecuted and punished. Whereas if you
are a lawful combatants on the other

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.520
hand you're entitled

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.720
to protection as an official
prisoner-of-war.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.750
Conditions like these reveal something
we desire to hold

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.039
above quick vengeance: dignity and
respect.

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:51.070
Both sides wish to be treated with that
and

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.100
uphold the bargain. Athletes agreed
to play fair,

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.710
to avoid prohibited things, even
technically safe and

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.169
otherwise legal things that would
nonetheless give them

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:07.020
an unfair advantage. They do this because
the spirit of the sport

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.070
is more important to them then the quickest

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.729
victory possible,

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.020
sportsmanship. Likewise, a sort of

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.520
"lovesmanship" exists in US court rooms.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.430
If the most sure-fire way of getting
the truth of someone's guilt

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.050
involves spoiling a bond of love. Spousal
privilege

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.669
says chill. Love is sacred. Truth

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.059
will come second, find another way. So,

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:38.580
if you are planning on committing crimes
in the US,

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.360
and you need an accomplice, marry them.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.779
Your spouse can not be forced to testify
against you.

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:48.909
There are different privileges applying
to other

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:52.389
relations of yours, allowing them to
refuse to give evidence

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:57.009
against you. These rules exist to honour
something that we deem, or

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:02.490
like to deem, greater than easy victory.
You cannot travel faster

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.570
than light.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.170
Or escape from a black hole. Or commit
perfidy

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.630
in a time of war. Or cheat on your
significant other.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.440
That's usually considered unfair,

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.000
but the final two aren't physical
limitations of matter.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.460
They are voluntary obstacles reflecting

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.210
what we value. Whether we respect those
values, or not, is another story.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.470
And how we interpret what actions are over
the line and what aren't

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.470
is a matter of judgment. We didn't get to
create

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.870
protons or planets - they were already
here.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.070
But we do get to create judgments.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.420
We even named ourselves after that
ability.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.780
We call ourselves Homo sapiens. 'Homo'
meaning

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.660
hummus - the soil, we are from the earth.
'Sapien' mean

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.220
sapiens, the ability to make wise
judgments.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.420
Very few people would argue that all
truly is fair

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.730
in love and war, but in love and war

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:06.070
behaviours otherwise not acceptable can
be not only forgiven,

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.590
but recommended. Reading messages not
meant for yourself,

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.910
using disguises, even murder can be
downgraded to a

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.350
crime of passion or lawful combat.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.540
But love and war put different things at
stake.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.800
And just because unfair things are
expected during love

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.480
and war doesn't mean that within their
respective domains

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.290
we prosecute or prohibit unfairness in the same way.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.920
Violating the law of war is a crime

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.310
but there is no official law of

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.290
love.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.980
You can prosecute someone for perfidy, or
desertion,

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.370
or weaponising the weather,

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.830
but you can't prosecute cupid for heartbreak.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.280
You can't have someone arrested for not
loving you back

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.410
and you shouldn't call 911 if someone leaves you

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.390
for someone else.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:02.550
You see, there is no Geneva Convention
for love.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.300
Furthermore, we often route for friends
or

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:09.570
fictional characters who follow their
hearts, even if it means leaving someone

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:10.100
we

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.499
care less for -

00:08:11.499 --> 00:08:15.069
a minor character for instance - alone or
stranded

00:08:15.069 --> 00:08:16.500
at the altar.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.860
Does this mean that love is a better
excuse for bad behavior

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.220
than war?

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:26.280
Obviously not for criminal behaviour, but
otherwise?

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.150
As far as authoritative powers and our
modern conception of love

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.510
are concerned,

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:35.990
war - its technologies and strategies are
human invention.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.640
Whereas love

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.899
is a human condition.

00:08:39.899 --> 00:08:43.349
Love is like inertia or death - inevitable.

00:08:43.349 --> 00:08:46.369
A law of nature and blameless,

00:08:46.369 --> 00:08:49.899
if unkind. We legislate where a bomb can fall,

00:08:49.899 --> 00:08:54.059
where debris can fall and prosecute
those who violate those rulings.

00:08:54.059 --> 00:08:57.889
But we don't prosecute gravity for
making

00:08:57.889 --> 00:09:02.369
things fall. We support voluntary
restrictions on

00:09:02.369 --> 00:09:05.790
fair play in sports more - public etiquette.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.389
But the players in love's battlefield are blameless

00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:12.480
victims of their passion, even if those
passions

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.549
are nonsensical. The heart has its
reasons,

00:09:16.549 --> 00:09:19.910
which reason knows nothing of. Deceiving
others,

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:26.509
that is what the world calls a romance.
Maybe love has this power intrinsically or

00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:29.529
maybe we give it that power by
leaving so

00:09:29.529 --> 00:09:32.529
legally alone. But either way,

00:09:32.529 --> 00:09:35.720
broken bones are the domain of law.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.639
Broken hearts are the domain of 'aww',

00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:42.010
'shucks',

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:45.530
'sorry'. And as always,

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.000
thanks for watching.
