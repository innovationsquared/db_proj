00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.429
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
But where

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:06.660
is here and how much does it weigh?

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.019
That's the supposed to be me, huh?
Imitation is a form of flattery.

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.660
An honor.
But what is the greatest honor

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.360
possible?

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.869
Let's begin our journey by looking at
challenges and achievements

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.610
worthy of honour.
First, the physical ones.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.640
Being the fastest person to run a marathon

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.840
26.2 miles is great but why stop there?

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.100
The Iron Man triathlon involves

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.850
swimming - 2.4 miles, racing on a bicycle 112 miles

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.280
and then running an entire marathon.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.530
Record holder Craig Alexander did it all in

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.150
8 hours, 3 minutes and 56 seconds.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.960
Beyond that things begin to get mental.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.879
The self transcendence race held every
summer in New York

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.049
is the longest certified foot race

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.350
on the planet.
It's not 26 miles long,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.840
it's 3100.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.280
And instead of running thousands of miles
across the varied

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.580
landscape of the US, competitors merely run

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.140
around the same city block in Queens

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.810
5 649 times.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.740
You have 52 days to complete the
race and doing so can

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.700
wear out as many as 12 pairs of shoes.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.440
The fastest time for completing the race
goes to Wolfgang Schwerk

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.939
who finished in just 41 days,

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.079
averaging 75 miles of running

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.590
every day.
In the realm of entertainment

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.420
there are very clear physical rewards, statuettes like

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.479
the Emmy, the Grammy, the Oscar and the Tony.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.789
Winning at least one of each is called an

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:01.799
EGOT. So far 11 humans have won all
four awards in competitive categories.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.389
Marvin Hamlisch and Richard Rodgers
also each won a Pulitzer Prize.

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:11.130
Lynn Redgrave is the only person to have
ever been nominated

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.130
for all four awards without winning

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.010
a single one.
Some people have won surprising combinations of awards.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.830
Steve Tisch, as chairman and executive
vice president of the New York Giants

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.090
and producer of films like Forrest Gump,
American History X

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.260
and Snatch is the only person in history
to have won both

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.600
a Super Bowl ring and an Oscar.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.190
And throughout all of human history only one person

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.250
has won an Oscar and a Nobel Prize.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.960
George Bernard Shaw.
Those are neat facts

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.820
but let's define honour. There are two
guys we should go to. The first is Noah

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.490
Webster

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.670
whose American Dictionary is the reason Americans

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.180
spell it honor. The second guy is Samuel
Johnson whose English Dictionary is the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.010
reason people

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.280
across the Atlantic, where I usually am, spell it

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.850
honour. Johnson differentiated two types
of honored that are relevant to the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:12.540
question

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.250
in this video's title.
The first is what he calls

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.240
nobility of soul, magnanimity and the scorn

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.300
of meanness. This is honour derived not from
achievement at something competitive

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.290
but rather from perceived virtuous conduct

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.050
and personal integrity.
But what counts

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.830
as a virtue? One of my favorite attempts
to catalog human virtues was done by

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.090
Christopher Peterson

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.600
and Martin Seligman.
Frustrated by a persistent

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.140
focus on mental illness, they devised a guide

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.760
to mental wellness.
Their catalog contains 24

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.100
virtues and strengths shared across nearly every

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.440
human culture.
They attached historical figures

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.660
believed to personify each trait and
their list of 24

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.970
included fairness, humility,

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.600
hope, humor, appreciation,

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.950
of beauty and the love of learning.
Using

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.530
their list as a scorecard for virtue points to determine

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.389
the most honorable person is impossible

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.000
but that hasn't stopped people from
discussing the greatest

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.840
honor in terms of virtue.
Richard Nixon did some things that people might

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.530
consider

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.050
dishonorable, but his perspective is illuminating.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.249
In his first inaugural address he said "the greatest

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:40.080
honor history can bestow is the title

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.060
of peacemaker."
Peacemaker.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.629
But who has the authority to judge virtue?

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:52.240
Hopefully not individuals.
Richard Wiseman's brilliant

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.409
"Quirkology" discusses a survey conducted
in 1997 by US News &amp; World Report,

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:00.669
which asked people who they thought was

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.979
somewhat likely to go to heaven

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:08.509
as a marker of perceived virtuous
conduct and personal integrity

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.740
it's really illuminating.
52 percent

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.150
thought that Bill Clinton would,
60 percent but Princess Diana would

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.590
and a full 79 percent said
that they thought Mother Teresa

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.199
would go to heaven but she was only second-place.

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.830
87 percent of respondents agreed that someone else

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:34.189
was likely to go to heaven.
Who do they think that was?

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:39.460
Themselves.
The greatest honor a country bestows upon those

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.110
who have defended, fought for it, often carries the most

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.319
awe-inspiring stories.
The greatest military honor in the United Kingdom

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:51.520
is the Victoria Cross.
In the United States

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.610
it's the Medal of Honor, given for
conspicuous gallantry

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.509
and intrepidity at the risk of life above and beyond

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:02.879
the call of duty.
Many of its recipients are honored

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:06.749
posthumously.
They are people who acted instantly

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:09.919
and without regard for their own safety

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.060
they've walked into enemy fire, loosing their lives

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.529
to communicate life-saving messages.
They have fallen on grenades

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:20.659
to absorb the impact with their bodies,

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:24.529
so that others around them wouldn't have to.

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:27.580
Samuel Johnson's second definition of honor

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.090
focuses not so much on honor that comes from being

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.189
ethically excellent, but instead on honor that comes

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:38.360
from power, from being royal

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.659
or famous. Global surveys have shown
that many corporate logos,

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:46.610
like the golden arches, are more famous
than any celebrity

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.270
or other symbols.
So, technically speaking, the greatest

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.830
honor as far as becoming famous and globally known

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.969
might simply be to become a fast food mascot.

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:02.879
Not all honorable people get honored.

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:05.990
How does a grand, recognized public act

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.659
made possible by being in the right
place at the right time with the right

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:13.809
opportunities compare to the honor of merely being

00:07:13.809 --> 00:07:17.949
the best person you can be?
A good citizen,

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:21.569
a mother, a father, an otherwise

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:24.930
unrecognized person who is nonetheless

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.710
an amazing hero to a few.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.129
Your family, your friends, that one person

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:35.939
who really needed you.
Is recognition merely

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:39.059
an accident of luck?
A snowball effect,

00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:43.900
an accumulation of advantage.
People who stand out when they are young

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.409
are often given access to more opportunities,

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:51.729
which then leads to and entitles them
to more opportunities later on,

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:56.080
accumulating overtime like snow on a
snowball that eventually becomes an

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.129
entire boulder of snow

00:07:58.129 --> 00:08:03.129
only the original snowball of which
was the original person.

00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:07.529
Historians have pointed this phenomenon
out, the accumulation of advantage,

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:10.939
when criticizing the great man theory

00:08:10.939 --> 00:08:14.460
of history.
The idea that human history can be talked

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:18.009
or understood as a time line of few

00:08:18.009 --> 00:08:21.159
important honored individuals.

00:08:21.159 --> 00:08:24.330
Philip Zimbardo, the researcher behind the infamous

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:29.180
Stanford Prison, study has shown that the
wrong situation can bring out

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:34.099
evil in almost anybody.
He stressed in his recent TED talk

00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:38.020
that not all of us will encounter just
the right opportunities to become the

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:38.490
next

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:42.300
Gandhi or Neil Armstrong.
But what we can do

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.430
is live our lives with what Zimbardo calls

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.900
a heroic imagination.
As a hero and waiting,

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.800
who thinks sociocentrically, not egocentrically.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.910
He says most heroes are everyday people,

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:02.310
who emerge as heroes in particular situations.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:06.050
So, a fair argument can be made that simply

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:10.970
knowing you did the right thing when
presented with the situation involving

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:11.779
Peterson

00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:14.959
and Seligman's virtues and strengths

00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:18.110
is the greatest honour

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.899
possible, the most honorable life.

00:09:21.899 --> 00:09:26.690
Now, whether or not that honorable
behavior is recognized

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.500
Well, Cato the Elder questioned the value imparted by

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.320
physical awards by simply saying, "after I'm dead

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.490
I'd rather have people ask why I have no monument

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:42.769
than why I have one."
It's an honor to talk to you guys

00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:44.789
every week.
So, as always,

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.780
thanks for watching.
