Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:10.849
This appears blue. This appears yellow.
And this appears green. Those of us with normal

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:19.060
color vision can probably agree.
But that doesn't change the fact that color is an illusion.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:26.060
Color, as we know it, does not exist in the
outside world, beyond us, like gravity or

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:35.579
protons do. Instead, color is created inside
our heads. Our brains convert a certain range

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:42.140
of the electromagnetic spectrum into color.
I can measure the wavelength of radiation,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:51.920
but I can't measure or observe
the experience of a color inside your mind.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:59.960
So, how do I know that when you and me look
at a strawberry, and, in my brain, this perception

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.880
occurs, which I call "red," that, in your
brain, a perception like this doesn't occur,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.039
which you have, of course, also learned to
call red. We both call it red. We communicate

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:19.819
effectively and walk away, never knowing just
how different each of our internal experiences

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:22.259
really were.

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.710
Of course, we already know that not everybody
sees color in exactly the same way. One example

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.759
would be color blindness. But we can diagnose
and discuss these differences because people

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.350
with the conditions fail to see things that most of us can.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.429
Conceivably though, there could be ways of
seeing that we use that cause colors to look

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:50.850
differently in different people's minds, without
altering their performances on any tests we

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.829
could come up with.

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.289
Of course, if that were the case, wouldn't
some people think other colors look better

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:03.209
than others? Or that some colors were more
complimentary of others? Well, yeah, but

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:05.740
doesn't that already happen?

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.740
This matters because it shows how fundamentally,
in terms of our perceptions, we are all alone

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.860
in our minds.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.900
Let's say I met an alien from a far away solar
system who, lucky enough, could speak English,

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.110
but had never, and could never, feel pain.
I could explain to the alien that pain is

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.580
sent through A delta and C fibers to the spinal
chord. The alien could learn every single

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.920
cell and pathway and process and chemical
involved in the feeling of pain. The alien

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.380
could pass a biology exam about pain and
believe that pain, to us, generally is a bad

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.960
thing.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:57.300
But no matter how much he learned, the alien
would never actually feel pain. Philosophers

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:05.940
call these ineffable, raw feelings "Qualia."
And our inability to connect physical phenomenon

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.660
to these raw feelings, our inability to explain
and share our own internal qualia is known

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.630
as the "Explanatory Gap." This gap is confronted
when describing color to someone who's been

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.180
blind their entire life.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.100
Tommy Edison has never been able to see.
He has a YouTube channel where he describes what

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:35.520
being blind is like. It's an amazing channel.
In one video he talks about colors and how

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.750
strange and foreign of a concept it seems
to him. Sighted people try to explain, for

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:47.570
instance, that red is "hot," and blue is "cold."
But to someone who has never seen a single

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:56.880
color, that just seems weird. And, as he explains,
it has never caused him to finally see a color.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.510
Some philosophers, like Daniel Dennett, argue
that qualia may be private and ineffable simply

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.550
because of a failure of our own language,
not because they are necessarily always

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.569
going to be impossible to share.

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.579
There may be an alien race that communicates
in a language that causes colors to appear

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.570
in your brain without your retina having to
be involved at all. Or without you having

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.630
to have ever needed to actually see the color
yourself. Perhaps, even in English, he says,

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.560
given millions and billions of words used
in just the right way, it may be possible

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:41.560
to adequately describe a color such that a
blind person could see it for the first time.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:48.290
Or you could figure out that, once-and-for-all,
yes or no, in fact, you and your friend

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.280
do not see the same red.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:05:00.060
But for now it remains the case that we
have no way of knowing if my red is the same

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:07.460
as your red. Maybe one day our language will
allow us to share and find out, or maybe

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.110
it never will. I know it's frustrating to
not have an answer, but the mere fact that

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:20.350
you guys can ask me about my internal experiences,
and the mere fact that I can ask my friends

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:27.169
and we can all collectively wonder at the
concept of qualia is quite incredible, and

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.760
also quite human.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.340
Animals can do all sorts of clever things
that we do. They can use tools, problem solve,

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:42.220
communicate, cooperate, exhibit curiosity,
plan for the future, and although we can't

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:49.620
know for sure, many animals certainly act
as if they feel emotions - loneliness, fear,

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.720
joy.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:57.340
Apes have even been taught to use language
to talk to us humans. It's a sort of sign

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.440
language that they've used to do everything
from answer questions, to express emotion,

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:08.710
or even produce novel thoughts. Unlike any
other animal, these apes are able to understand

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.750
language and form responses at about the level
of a 2.5 year old human child.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:24.500
But, there is something that no signing-ape
has ever done. No ape has ever asked a question.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.449
Joseph Jordania's "Who Asked the First Question?"
is a great read on this topic and it's available

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:32.540
for free online.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.100
For as long as we've been able to use sign
language to communicate with apes, they have

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:42.560
never wondered out loud
about anything that we might know that they

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.600
don't.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:50.500
Of course, this does not mean that apes, and
plenty of other animals, aren't curious. They

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:58.100
obviously are. But, what is suggests is that
they lack a "Theory of Mind." An understanding

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:04.870
that other people have separate minds.
That they have knowledge, access to information

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:12.080
that you might not have. Even us humans aren't
born with a "theory of mind," and there's

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:18.460
a famous experiment to test when a human child
first develops a "theory of mind." It is called

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.440
the "Sally-Anne" test.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:27.580
During the test, researchers tell children
a story about Sally and Anne. Sally and Anne

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:34.190
have a box and a basket in their room.
They also happen to have a delicious cookie. Now,

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:41.350
Sally takes the cookie and puts it inside
the box, and then Sally leaves the room. While

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:47.540
Sally is gone, Anne comes over to the box,
takes the cookie out and puts the cookie

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:53.979
inside the basket. Now, when Sally comes back,
the researchers ask the children "where

00:07:53.979 --> 00:07:59.270
will Sally look for the cookie?" Obviously,
Sally will look in the box. That's where she

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:04.190
left it. She has no way of knowing what Anne
did while she was gone. But until the age

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:10.600
of about 4, children will insist that Sally
will check the basket because, after all,

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:16.240
that's where the cookie is. The child saw
Anne move the cookie, so why wouldn't Sally

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:21.820
also know? Young children fail to realize
that Sally's mental representation of the

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:27.780
situation, her access to information,
can be different than their own.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:34.110
And apes who know sign language, but never
ask us questions, are doing the same thing.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:40.240
They're failing to recognize that other individuals
have similar cognitive abilities and can

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.380
be used as sources of information.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:53.000
So, we are all alone with our perceptions.
We are alone in our own minds. We can both

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:59.770
agree that chocolate tastes good. But I cannot
climb into your consciousness and experience

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:08.440
what chocolate tastes like to you. I can never
know if my red looks the same as your red.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.770
But I can ask.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:18.600
So, stay human, stay curious
and let the entire world know that you are.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.060
And as always,

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.480
thanks for watching.
