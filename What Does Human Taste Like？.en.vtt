00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.350
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:03.760
Eating your own boogers

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.490
is gross, but it might be smart. Assuming you have

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.580
clean fingers, lung specialist
Friedrich Bischinger points out that snot

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.150
contains antiseptic enzymes that kill

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.279
or weaken bacteria. Reintroducing

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.100
those crippled microorganisms may allow
your immune system to develop antibodies

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.170
in relative safety. Now, that is good to know-

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.310
-nose. But is eating your own snot

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.070
cannibalism(?) Self

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.730
cannibalism. Just like a cow or chicken or
fish or fruit or vegetable you are made out of alot of

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.000
edible things. The meat on an average human
body contains 77,000 dietary calories worth

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.860
of nutritional energy. Yum(!) If you decide to
become a cannibal, just don't show up late for dinner

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.040
or you'll get the cold shoulder.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.270
Jokes aside, cannibalism is a major

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.620
taboo. It's off-putting at a visceral level.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.380
Humans have dignity, they are more
than just skin bags full of organs.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.150
They're more than just

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.070
something to put on a plate.
But human meat has been put on

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.210
plates... and in bellies.
There are reports of cannibalism occurring

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.590
in times of famine as a last resort, and because of

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.070
curiosity and art. In the late 1980s,

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.360
artist Rick Gibson publicly ate human tonsils

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.100
and other donated human parts in London and Canada.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.330
In 2006, artist Marco Evaristti cooked and canned

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.070
meatballs prepared with his own body fat,

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.990
removed via liposuction. In 2011,

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.740
Dutch TV presenters Dennis Storm and 
Valerio Zeno cooked and ate

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.130
pieces of each other on a TV show whose title

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.280
meant "guinea pigs".
Because both of them lived, and

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.600
both consented to the act, they didn't do anything

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.890
illegal. One year later, a Japanese man posted

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.470
this tweet. Five diners took up his offer
and on April 13th, 2012,

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.549
they were served a $250 per plate meal consisting

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:20.650
of his genitals. A darker story occurred in 2001,

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.000
when Armin Meiwes ate and killed

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.200
a volunteer he found on the now defunct Cannibal Cafe.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.140
Although his meal ostensibly consented to the menu,

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.310
Meiwes was convicted of murder and

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.850
now, serving a life sentence in prison, has become

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.650
a devout vegetarian. Disgust aside, one question

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.190
remains. If you were to use your taste buds

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.440
to taste your

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.930
bud, what would it taste like? To be clear,

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.609
taste is a sensation caused by something
in your mouth chemically reacting with receptors

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.420
in your taste buds. Flavor is the even more complex

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.500
experience of taste, combined with smell, and
information, from the trigeminal nerve

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.099
about things like temperature, texture, pain

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.640
and pungency, as far as the cooked but otherwise

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.220
unadulterated spice-less, sauce-less flavor

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.989
of human meat. The late William Seabrook

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.769
provided, in my opinion, the best description.

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.819
While in West Africa, Seabrook
interviewed members of the Gear tribe,

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:31.530
people who

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.440
had eaten human flesh and found their
descriptions unsatisfactory. So,

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.180
when he returned to Paris he struck a
sneaky deal with an intern

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.260
at the Sorbonne and obtained a chunk

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.810
of human meat from an otherwise
healthy body recently involved

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.780
in an accident. He carefully prepared
the meat and wrote that,

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.440
quote, "It was like good, fully developed veal.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.420
Not young, but not yet beef. It was

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.569
mild, good meet with no other sharply
defined or highly characteristic

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.870
tastes, such as, for instance, goat, high game

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.489
and pork. The steak was slightly tougher
than prime veal, a little stringy, but not

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:11.970
too tough or stringy

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.760
to be agreeably edible. The roast, from
which I cut and ate

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.140
a central slice, was tender and in color,

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.060
texture, smell as well as taste
strengthened my certainty

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.349
that, of all the meats we habitually know, veal

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.550
is the one meat to which at this meat is accurately

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.659
comparable."
Seabrook never gave us any
recipes or complementary flavor

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:35.770
recommendations.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.810
But that brings us to this video's
title's second meaning.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.430
What does human taste like?

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.460
What does the human palate prefer?
Interestingly,

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.849
of all the possible combinations of identified

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:54.400
flavors we consume, human cuisine only features

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.539
a relatively small number of recipes.

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.630
A couple of years ago scientific
reports published a great paper on

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.190
the chemistry and networks behind food pairing.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.260
Researchers took 381 ingredients used in
five global cuisines

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.750
and 1,021 molecular compounds known to
contribute to their flavors

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.050
and created a flavor network.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.200
The size of the bubble represents the
ingredients prevalence in cooking.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.169
The thickness of the lines connecting
ingredients reflects the number

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.010
of flavor inducing molecules they significantly share.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.589
The researchers' flavor network backbone spans

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:36.839
fourteen different food categories
and is quite interesting.

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:41.020
By comparing this network to tens of
thousands of recipes

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.000
they found that North American and
Western European dishes tend to combine

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.710
ingredients that share

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.940
flavor compounds, while East Asian cuisine

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.370
avoids them. But that trend was caused by a few

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.479
out lighters in each cuisine, that,
if ignored, caused the difference in amount

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.969
of sharing to lessen. Those few ingredients

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:05.249
tend to be the most authentic. They tend
to be the most responsible for the taste palette

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.710
of a regional cuisine and contribute to this

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.460
illuminating visualization.
But some flavors don't go together

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.789
in any cuisine. For instance, orange juice

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:21.640
and toothpaste. Why does orange juice taste
so disgusting right after brushing?

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.330
Well, most toothpastes contain sodium
lauryl sulfate - a chemical that helps the

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.899
paste get sudsy and frothy during use.

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:32.880
That action helps pull brushed off
debris away from your teeth,

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.969
but sodium lauryl sulfate also
suppresses sweet receptors

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:40.450
in your mouth and destroy phospholipids that inhibit

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.789
your bitter receptors, making sweet orange juice

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:47.149
taste not so sweet and grossly

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:50.260
bitter, for up to an hour after brushing.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.490
What interests me the most about flavor
is the fact that the

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.010
things that cause it eventually become

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.839
you! You are what you eat, scientifically.

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:06.570
Your body is always losing dead cells
but the elements and molecules you

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:10.570
ingest are processed by your body into

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.610
new body. Here's a fun way to think about it.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.860
Under the direction of DNA, a cat

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.219
is made out of air, water and cat food.

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:24.880
That's it. Cats have less varied diets than

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.250
humans. We can taste sweetness but cats

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.130
lack the gene required to do so.
However, they can taste

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:37.120
ATP, a molecule that moves around
chemical energy for cells to use in the

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.700
body, which may be a sign to them

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.729
that they're tasting meat. The point is,

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:46.209
sights and sounds and textures and shapes and smells

00:07:46.209 --> 00:07:50.399
are the names we give to things that
eventually become our memories.

00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:56.139
But flavor is the name we give to the
experience of things that eventually become

00:07:56.149 --> 00:07:59.360
our bodies. Contemplating the

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.490
flavor of human meat is gross. But think of it this way:

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.979
you're currently tasting human,
you're tasting human right now.

00:08:07.979 --> 00:08:11.930
Your tongue and taste buds are in
contact with your mouth

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.909
almost constantly. Now, granted, it's more
of a passive thing - your mouth just

00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:17.050
happens to contain

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.539
your tongue. You're not actually eating

00:08:20.539 --> 00:08:24.159
yourself... but you kind of are.

00:08:24.159 --> 00:08:28.000
Your body is constantly swallowing
your own mucus

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and digesting pieces of your body like
dead cells from your tongue

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.640
and cheek. But that's nothing
compared to the self cannibalism

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.950
of the sea squirt.
The sea squirt lives a sort of

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.399
self-cannibalistic 'Flowers for Algernon' life.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:47.850
When born, it resembles a tadpole
and has a notochord,

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:53.209
putting it in the same phylum as humans.
It swims around until it finds a nice place

00:08:53.209 --> 00:08:56.269
to adhere. A rock, a plant.

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:59.370
Once stuck, it begins retrogressive

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.970
metamorphosis. Literally digesting its own
nervous system, eating the closest thing

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:05.510
it ever had to a brain

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:09.810
and lives the rest of its life in a
sensile un-locomoting

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.990
clump. It is a bit of a downgrade,

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:16.420
but they are prime evidence that the
evolution of the brain was spawned by

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.110
the need

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:20.950
to move as soon.
As these guys don't need to move around,

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:25.830
they eat their brains.
That is way more extreme than the self-cannibalism

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.060
you participate in every day

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:32.690
by swallowing. But don't feel bad.
About every three months or so

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:36.350
you swallow and digest your own

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.090
body weight worth of you.

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.910
That means that every day you are a
little more than one percent of the

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:44.790
mythical

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.910
ouroboros, the snake eating its own tail.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.750
You are what you eat but you are also a thing

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.070
that you eat.

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.170
And as always,

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.670
thanks for watching.
