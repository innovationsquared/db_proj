00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.759
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
This

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.900
is called the dolly zoom effect
and the optics that make it possible

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.250
are also responsible for what's called the moon

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.430
terminator illusion.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.630
A terminator is the line between an illuminated

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.690
and dark side.
Light arrives

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.300
perpendicular to the terminator but it
doesn't always

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.040
appear to.
Maybe you've noticed this before. When the Moon

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.510
and the Sun are up at the same time,
and a good distance apart

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.750
in the sky, the direction the Moon is being lit

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.809
from won't always appear to line up

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.069
with the position of the Sun.
What's going on here?

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.879
The answer lies

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.729
in visual angles.
The further away from you something is,

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:59.979
the smaller it will appear to be.
In psychophysical terms, its visual angle

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:04.370
shrinks - the angle within your field of
view that it stretches across.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.210
Now, this means that everything
we look at is foreshortened,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.100
that is it diminishes incise towards the horizon line.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.540
A line infinitely far away.
Things that far away

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.630
are foreshortened to the point at which
they have no height

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.720
whatsoever.
This distortion

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.790
affects everything that we look at.
But it doesn't confuse us, because

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.220
our brains know about it.
We can look at an object that is foreshortened and

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.390
figure out what it probably actually looks like.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.800
For example, a door is a rectangle,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.950
but it's wrecked by foreshortening when

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.710
opened.
Closer distances appear larger. The whole shape

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.500
is different, but your brain isn't
freaked out every time a door opens,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.710
because it understands

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.110
that different sensations don't necessarily mean

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.450
different actual things.
It's called subjective

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.580
constancy.
Our brains cleverly factor in previous

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.570
experience and perspective clues from
the surrounding world

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.730
to calculate in real time whether changes

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.110
in what we sense are because of actual changes

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.989
in the things we're looking at or are
just merely products of their positions

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.790
or the surroundings.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.220
For example, I, right now on this video screen,

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.130
am vulnerable to foreshortening.
But I probably look

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.990
okay to you.
However, if we frame in really closely

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.730
and remove surrounding perspective clues,
I can be made to look

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.520
weird, strange, a little scary,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.530
distended.
I'm foreshortened without the necessary tools

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.510
around me for you to mentally adjust.
This

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.090
is probably the crux of the Moon terminator

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.340
illusion.
Take a look at this.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.420
The line where that wall meets the ceiling

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.630
is a straight line.
Seriously, take a look.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.270
If you look to the left and right,
it continues to look straight

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.590
and trust me, this building was built with level straight

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.780
ceilings.
But that's not what your eye

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.890
senses.
A camera will help

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.130
demonstrate this. It doesn't add in the
post sensation processing that our

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.930
brains do

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.890
and we can also frame in to remove other
clues telling us what to think.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.250
Now, sure enough, right in front of us the line is

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.600
level with the screen of the camera -
it's a straight line - but

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.040
if we move our eyes across the line,
look what happens. If I pan this way,

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.209
the slope changes and now the line
appears to be going

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.320
up and to the left.
And if I panned

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.920
this way, the line appears to be moving
up and to the right.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.540
What's going on here?
A straight line can't have changing slope,

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.099
that's what a curved line does.

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.859
Just like the curve we think we see
between the Sun

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.859
and the Moon.
But wait. If

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:01.150
the line between the Sun and the Moon is
curved because of foreshortening,

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.920
why don't we see lines like this one as curves?
Well,

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.329
here's a clue.
Clues.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.659
We know what rooms are supposed to look like.
We know how they're built. We have

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:15.280
experience with them and there are other
things in the environment

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.030
helping us. But when you look at the sky,
there's not much to help you.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.370
In the absence of clues about distance
and perspective, our brains assume that

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.789
whatever we're looking at is

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:29.570
equidistant from us, making the sky a sort of

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.669
dome surface, like a planetarium screen.

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.789
The only clue we have then is the horizon,
but it's a red herring,

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:41.110
because the horizon doesn't foreshorten.
It's just a place where

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.770
due to foreshortening everything becomes infinitely flat.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.729
Brian Rogers and Olga Naumenko 
demonstrated that these things result

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.400
in the terminator illusion by using a planetarium.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.240
They projected two dots onto its dome,
mimicking our perception of the Sun

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.389
and the Moon. They've then asked
participants to place a third dot on the

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:02.860
straight line connecting them.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.260
But just as in the Moon terminator illusion, people

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.690
incorrectly placed the third dot.
They were influenced by a desire to stay

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.580
parallel to the horizon,

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.169
as if it was subject to the same foreshortening rules.
Our brains also

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.580
often fail to factor in foreshortening
when it comes to crepuscular rays,

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.580
light beams streaming through gaps in clouds.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.570
They appear to converge from a common point,
as if the Sun is only

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.560
a few thousand meters above Earth, but, of
course, in fact, the Sun is extremely

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.460
far away

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.780
and these lines are actually pretty much exactly parallel.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.890
It's true. They look like they converge
for the same reason railroad tracks

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.080
appear to converge.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.340
The visual angle of the distance separating them

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.090
shrinks the further down you look.
Sometimes

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.850
our brains do the opposite.
They assume

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.180
and consider foreshortening even when it isn't

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.260
really there, like in this illusion, where

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.990
the cars seem to be different sizes but
in actuality on the page

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.210
are all the same size. Everything else in
the image is affected by foreshortening,

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.860
so our brains assume that the cars
are too and decide that in order for them

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.190
all to have the same visual angle, which they do,

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.800
the more distant ones must be literally larger

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.260
in real life.
The rate at which the visual angle

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.110
of something you are looking at changes as
you move toward it, or away from it,

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.340
is not constant.
In order to cut the visual

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.720
angle of an object in half, its distance from you

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.840
must double.
That means objects

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.880
really really far away require a lot
more movement to have their visual angle

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.600
changed compared to nearer objects.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.160
This is called parallax and it's a major reason

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.210
moving allows us to learn so much about

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.290
depth.
It's why stuff on the side of the road

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.800
whizzes is by you as you drive past,
while distant features of the landscape

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.320
appear to only crawl past.
A really distant thing, like,

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.480
say, the Moon, 384,000 kilometers away

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.630
appears to move so little as you do, it can seem

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.639
to be following you.

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:21.859
It's not, of course. It's just geometry.
For the same reasons,

00:07:21.859 --> 00:07:26.309
moving a camera through space will
affect the visual angle of nearer

00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:26.859
things,

00:07:26.859 --> 00:07:29.999
like the Vsauce mug here much more dramatically than

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:33.609
distant things,
like Jake Chudnow's album against the wall.

00:07:33.609 --> 00:07:36.689
It is barely changing size as we move back

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:40.499
and forth.
But unlike moving, zooming

00:07:40.499 --> 00:07:43.539
increases the visual angle of
everything equally,

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:46.919
regardless of depth.
Notice that when zooming,

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:51.959
the distant album grows and shrinks
right along with the mug. Now, if you move

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:55.169
IN while zooming OUT, or vice versa,

00:07:55.169 --> 00:07:58.339
the zoom will be most apparent when looking at distant

00:07:58.339 --> 00:08:01.939
things, while the move more apparent on near things.

00:08:01.939 --> 00:08:05.939
The result can be trippy.
Here I've been placed where both

00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:09.839
effects cancel each other out,
so everything around me changes

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:14.139
instead. Another great illusion that
takes advantage of parallax

00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:17.599
is the popular star field or hallway illusion.

00:08:17.599 --> 00:08:21.179
Cover the middle of the video
and you'll appear to be moving

00:08:21.179 --> 00:08:25.469
much faster.
But you if cover the edges, you'll appear to be moving

00:08:25.469 --> 00:08:29.629
much slower. All you're doing is altering
the perspective clues your brain

00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:30.289
receives

00:08:30.289 --> 00:08:33.620
about movement.
The nearer stuff at the edge

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.959
changes position faster
than the distance stuff way ahead.

00:08:36.959 --> 00:08:39.990
So if you cover the slow distance stuff your brain

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:44.970
only has the faster moving stuff to
judge speed from. But cover the faster

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:48.290
near stuff and the slower stuff becomes the new

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:52.350
near.
Your brain assumes that you've slowed down.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.059
The optics and mathematics behind all of these effects

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.329
were understood at least thousands of years ago.

00:08:59.329 --> 00:09:02.959
During the Renaissance, artists used that
knowledge to produce

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:05.990
paintings that imitated reality really

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.300
well.
I mean, the perspective is quite realistic.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.000
But... the renaissance?

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.940
Why did it take so long for us get there?

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.660
I mean, look at this pre-Renaissance painting.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.660
What the heck is going on here?
The perspective is all wrong. That's not at

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.710
all what such a scene would actually

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:31.920
look like.
Artists and viewers contemporary to works like that

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.190
saw the world just like we do, they

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:39.350
saw foreshortening - they couldn't help but
see it. Foreshortening is right there in

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:40.150
plain sight.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:43.330
No, foreshortening is

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.600
plain sight.
So, what gives?

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.700
Were medieval artists all just a bunch of five year olds?

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.290
No.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:56.930
No in the sense that the question is wrong.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.340
Realistic-looking perspective was used
way before the Renaissance.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.660
Now, it might not have always been
mathematically formal perspective,

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:09.820
but foreshortening was understood.
Western art went from this

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:14.470
to this, not because humans all of a
sudden became smarter,

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:17.640
but because of a difference in desire.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.260
What to us today might look unrealistic and thus

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.460
bad, was, in its time,

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:28.400
deliberate and popular.
The shift

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.620
to imitating the world mathematically,
as if seen through a window,

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.470
was more about cultural interests and objectivity and

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.190
the individual than it was about artists
all of a sudden becoming

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:44.610
smarter.
Furthermore, perspective illusions shows that what we

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.790
think we see isn't always what we're seeing.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.900
A child's drawing may seem crude

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.320
in terms of objective mathematical imitation,

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.810
but there are other things about the world and

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:01.730
our experience of it worth imitating.
Teasing out

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:05.040
the less plainly obvious to show
something personal

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.790
is sometimes even harder than following
perspective grids

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:12.820
Picasso put it this way it: "It took me four years

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:17.850
to learn to paint like Rafael,
but a lifetime to learn to paint

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.290
like a child."

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.120
And as always,

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.500
thanks for watching.
