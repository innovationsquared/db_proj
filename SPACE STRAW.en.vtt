00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.730
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
Our atmosphere

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.299
is a thin vail of air, held to earth's surface

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.290
by gravity.
We live in it, we breathe it, we walk through it

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.320
every day; it contains all weather, but yet

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.949
it is almost nothing.
In fact,

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.090
if the earth was the size of an apple
our atmosphere from the ground all

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.619
the way to outer space

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.899
would only be about as thick

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.010
as the skin of an apple.
And because our atmosphere gets

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.739
thinner, exponentially as you go up,
90 percent of our atmospheres mass

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.540
at this scale could fit within a space
as thin as just a

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.430
third of an apple's skin.
But that shrimpy sliver of a peel

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.539
would still be thousands of times
thicker than you are tall.

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.710
We humans are itsy bitsy dots

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.050
strolling around in a skinny sky.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.930
But that skinny sky does a lot.
Think about this.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.420
What if I had a really awesome big straw

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.540
and I stuck one end in the ocean and the other end out

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.390
in space.
Would outer space be able to suck

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.600
all the water out?
We know that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.020
naked exposed veneer vacuum of space

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.130
all non concealed gases in your body

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.140
would be violently farted and burped

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.750
out. Sucked out.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.159
But sucking is not attractive.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.780
Instead, sucking merely refers to a flow

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.520
from a region of higher pressure to a
region of lower pressure.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.500
In other words, a vacuum cleaner in and
of itself does not

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.850
attract matter to itself.
Like I said in my video

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.909
with no title, if you were to turn on a vacuum cleaner

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.560
at sea level,
a region inside the cleaner becomes as

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.979
thin as air in Denver, Colorado.
External

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.570
air, which is at a greater pressure,
is then literally pushed

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.079
by its own greater pressure into the machine, bringing

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.819
dust and debris with it.
The point is,

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.110
the strength of the force pushing air
into a vacuum cleaner

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.560
can only be as strong as the pressure

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.760
of the surrounding air.
Here on earth,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.069
using a vacuum cleaner or even a space straw,
that pressure is

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.640
atmospheric pressure.
At sea level about 15 pounds per square inch

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.959
or 65.4 Newton's.
That amount of force can

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.160
only push pure water up about 10.3 meters

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.250
or 33.9 feet.
Because outer space

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.370
is not 10 meters up,
it's more like 100,000 meters up,

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.050
a space straw would be a terrible
doomsday device for a super villain to

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.760
use to get rid of our oceans.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.800
Our atmosphere just isn't heavy or strong enough

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.819
to push water into orbit.
Because the weight

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.800
of air above, pushing molecules below in
all directions is responsible for

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.790
air pressure, air lowered down exerts

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.530
more pressure. The air at your feet
pushes with a slightly greater force

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.950
than the

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.550
air at your head. Now, across the human
body, you can't tell the difference.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.230
But if an object is light enough,
it can be affected by this difference,

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.250
which is why a helium balloon floats.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.709
The air down here pushes a tiny bit more
strongly than the air up here,

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.420
and since the balloon is lighter than
the same volume of air, it's literally

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.440
pushed up

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.680
by the air more strongly than gravity pulls it down.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.870
This upward force, caused by a surrounding fluid

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.290
or gas that counteracts an object's weight,

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.049
is known as buoyancy.
Now, here on the surface of the earth,

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.049
the buoyancy of air isn't enough to
cause humans to float away

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.989
or be lifted. But it exists.
In fact, in a perfect vacuum,

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.620
you would weigh about a fifth of pound
more than you do

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.670
right now.
Thanks air! Back to our balloon

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.310
friend.
He's not going to float up forever

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.200
in the outer space, escaping earth.
Eventually, as the atmosphere thins out,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.900
and the baloon expands, it will

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.079
pop and fall back down to earth,
its helium spreading throughout the atmosphere.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.300
So, besides rockets that we intentionally

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.810
launch off of Earth, does our atmosphere ever

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.210
lose anything?
Does earth ever lose anything?

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.199
Does Earth ever gain anything?

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.240
I mean, I used to be smaller, I used to be a little kid.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.009
But all of the atoms and molecules in my
body right now simply came from things

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:43.400
that I

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.540
consumed.
Things that I ate or drank or breathed in.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.780
When new kids are born, the earth doesn't get

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.520
heavier, because a new baby is just a rearrangement of

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.910
atoms and molecules that used to be inside its mother

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.930
or molecules that she ate, drank or breathed in,

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.389
all of which came from earth.
Everything's recycled,

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:09.060
so is the earth not gaining or losing mass?

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.940
Well to begin, earth does lose some stuff.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.120
For instance, hydrogen and helium are a bit too light

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.150
to stick around because of earth's
gravity. They eventually fly out into

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.080
space or get picked off by solar wind

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.620
at the edge of our atmosphere,
which is why, as I've said before,

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.639
we are likely to one day run out

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.900
of helium. Pretty soon.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.139
But the earth gains mass in some ways as well.
For instance,

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:39.870
every year it's been estimated that 10 to 20

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.280
million kilograms of space dust
and meteorite fragments fall to Earth,

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.520
making it heavier. Now, if you factor in
the energy that the earth radiates away,

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.669
which is equivalent to mass, as well as
the energy the earth gets from the Sun

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:56.110
and holds onto, for instance,
using its greenhouse gases,

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.460
in total it has been calculated that every

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.699
year earth becomes 50 million kilograms

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:08.009
lighter.
That might sound like a lot,

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:15.009
but it is only 0.00 0000 0000 0000

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:19.770
1 percent of Earth's total mass,

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.880
which means that for all intents and
purposes, the stuff that we are made of,

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.669
the atoms and molecules in our bodies,
the food that we eat, the water that we drink, our

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:29.810
best friends,

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.150
has all been here since the early days

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.449
of Earth, including the air that you are breathing

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:42.380
right now.
Remember that six trillion
kilograms of oxygen that all humans

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.030
inhale

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.720
every year? Well, each and every one of us,
individually contributes by breathing

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.710
about 8.5 million times per year.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.289
Here's the thing about a breath.
Because molecules

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:58.889
are so frustratingly small, a single

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:02.940
little breath contains about 10 sextillion

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.260
molecules.
In a poetic

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.979
twist of symmetry, Earth's entire
atmosphere contains a volume of air

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:14.180
equal to about 10 sextillion

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.039
breaths.
The number of molecules in one breath

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:22.470
is equal to the number of breaths our
earth has to give us,

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.810
that is assuming, of course, that we never
exhaled anything and it never got renewed,

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:26.979
which it does.

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:30.400
And because our atmosphere gets circulated so quickly

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.819
and because we breathe so often and
because molecules are so small,

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:38.220
statistically speaking, our atmosphere

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.639
our skinny little peel of air is

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:45.800
crowded with molecules that we've all
had inside our bodies

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.280
and been breathing.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.949
To make this really mind-blowing,
let's focus only

00:07:53.949 --> 00:07:57.650
on carbon dioxide.
We don't just breathe it in

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.690
and then right back out again.
It's a waste product that comes from all over

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:01.720
our bodies.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.889
And carbon dioxide is useful to plants, which

00:08:04.889 --> 00:08:09.050
absorb it and then turn it into sugars.
It doesn't just inertly float around our

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.319
atmosphere

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:13.660
forever. Okay.
Well, it has been estimated

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.129
that it takes one breath

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:21.259
about 1 year to thoroughly mix
throughout the hemisphere's

00:08:21.259 --> 00:08:25.900
of earth and about 10 years to
thoroughly mix within the troposphere

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:26.900
that we live in

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:31.889
and the stratosphere above.
Now, given that only 5 percent of what we

00:08:31.889 --> 00:08:36.209
exhale is carbon dioxide and only 20 percent of that

00:08:36.209 --> 00:08:39.320
came from metabolism within our brain,

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:46.480
even if we assume that 99.99999 percent

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:51.290
of all the  CO2 you have ever exhaled has
been trapped in the oceans or absorbed

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:51.880
by plants

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:56.190
and made into sugars, it is still
mathematically certain,

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.980
even if you were in a brand new place
you've never breathed in before,

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:05.940
that every breath you take contains at
least a few molecules that were once

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.980
inside your brain.
A few of them

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:13.040
may have been molecules that you used
five years ago to remember where you

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.360
left your keys.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.850
A few of them may have been inside your brain

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.670
when you first fell in love.
And

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:25.720
a few of them, almost certainly, were inside the brain

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.100
of your mother while she was giving birth

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.220
to you.
So,

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.660
take a deep breath because our air is

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:39.209
crowded with history.
And keep breathing,

00:09:39.209 --> 00:09:42.300
because within the next 10 years it is certain that

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.450
I will breathe in a few carbon dioxide molecules that are

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:49.470
inside your brain right now, as you listen to me say

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:50.220
that:

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.140
As always,

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.840
thanks for watching.
