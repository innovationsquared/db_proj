00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.890
Hey, Vsauce Michael here, and I'm celebrating the holidays in my mom's basement.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.472
But a few days ago, MadmegzOfEpic @tweetsauce this question.

00:00:10.472 --> 00:00:13.519
Now, at first I was like, the end of a rainbow?

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.815
Of course you can't get there, everybody knows that.

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:18.314
But then I said, why?

00:00:18.314 --> 00:00:21.230
I mean, what would happen if I saw a rainbow

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.491
and I fired a camera bullet at the rainbow?

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:26.319
What would the footage look like?

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:29.905
Well, I found that in this impossible journey to a rainbow,

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:31.622
you can learn a lot.

00:00:31.622 --> 00:00:36.081
For instance, the rainbow that you see is unique to you.

00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:39.424
That's right, anybody nearby will also see a rainbow,

00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:41.750
but their rainbow will be slightly different.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.723
There's a different rainbow for everybody, and that's because rainbows  are apparent phenomenon.

00:00:47.723 --> 00:00:52.770
Where you are dictates where
the rainbow will appear to you.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.808
Rainbows happen because sunlight behind your body

00:00:55.808 --> 00:01:00.399
enters into raindrops in front of you that then reflect it back into your eyeballs,

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.148
and there's a rainbow because
raindrops not only reflect light,

00:01:04.148 --> 00:01:06.403
they also refract it.

00:01:06.403 --> 00:01:10.653
Refraction occurs whenever any type of wave enters a new medium

00:01:10.653 --> 00:01:13.081
where its speed is changed.

00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:16.413
In order to change speed, that
wave must change direction.

00:01:16.413 --> 00:01:19.755
So when white light from the sun enters a raindrop,

00:01:19.755 --> 00:01:22.793
it is refracted. It changes direction.

00:01:22.793 --> 00:01:28.055
And different wavelengths of white, which means different colors, are refracted differently.

00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:31.600
So they get separated into what we know as ROY G BIV.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.810
The geometry of a spherical raindrop means

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.142
that this spectrum of colors will only be visible to you

00:01:38.142 --> 00:01:41.647
from a very specific angle relative to where you are,

00:01:41.647 --> 00:01:45.111
and that angle is about 40 to 42 degrees

00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:48.240
from the angle of your head to your head's shadow.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.201
Here is a way to think about it.

00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:52.994
The spectrum of a rainbow is firing out of raindrops

00:01:52.994 --> 00:01:55.910
between the angle of 40 and 42 degrees.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.795
So if you move forward, you'll just see that rainbow coming from different drops,

00:01:59.795 --> 00:02:05.718
except light that reflects more
than one time inside the raindrop.

00:02:05.718 --> 00:02:07.922
Now, in order for this light to get to your eyes,

00:02:07.922 --> 00:02:10.127
it has to reflect at a very specific angle.

00:02:10.127 --> 00:02:13.428
So it's only visible about 50 to 53 degrees

00:02:13.428 --> 00:02:17.721
from your perspective, and this my
friends, is the double rainbow.

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:20.393
Now again, because of spherical geometry,

00:02:20.393 --> 00:02:23.897
these raindrops are not going to be
able to reflect light to your eyeballs

00:02:23.897 --> 00:02:29.941
between 42 to 50 degrees, which means the area between a primary and secondary rainbow

00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:32.781
is darker than the rest of the sky.

00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:36.784
This area is known as Alexander's Dark Band.

00:02:36.784 --> 00:02:39.537
Oh, and there's way more than
we could ever cover here.

00:02:39.537 --> 00:02:44.921
For instance, if the sun is already set, but the moon
is behind you producing enough light,

00:02:44.921 --> 00:02:47.044
you can get a moon bow.

00:02:47.044 --> 00:02:50.132
Also cool, reflection rainbows.

00:02:50.132 --> 00:02:52.259
If one of these occurs with a normal rainbow,

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:55.724
you'll have two rainbows that
don't line up, that aren't parallel.

00:02:55.724 --> 00:02:58.182
The reason is that one of these rainbows

00:02:58.182 --> 00:03:00.265
is not coming from sunlight behind the viewer,

00:03:00.265 --> 00:03:04.399
but instead from sunlight reflected from the lake below.

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:07.813
Because you can only see a rainbow from a certain angle,

00:03:07.813 --> 00:03:12.237
if you move your body, you will continue to see that rainbow from the same angle,

00:03:12.237 --> 00:03:14.827
which means the rainbow will move with you.

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:17.032
It will appear to be following you.

00:03:17.032 --> 00:03:22.873
This is particularly apparent when you're flying in an airplane, high above the ground, moving quickly.

00:03:22.873 --> 00:03:25.504
Now, because you're so far off the ground,

00:03:25.504 --> 00:03:27.921
the rainbow, which is centered around your shadow,

00:03:27.921 --> 00:03:31.253
is actually 100 percent completely visible,

00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:33.681
which means none of it is hiding below the horizon,

00:03:33.681 --> 00:03:37.054
which means you see a circular rainbow.

00:03:37.054 --> 00:03:39.978
And as you can see, as the plan flies through the clouds,

00:03:39.978 --> 00:03:43.899
the rainbow continues to be in
the same apparent position.

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:46.611
So if I fired a bullet camera right at a rainbow,

00:03:46.611 --> 00:03:52.740
the rainbow would not get closer; instead, it would appear to recede just as fast as the camera approached it.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.778
Rainbow is a classic compound word,

00:03:55.778 --> 00:03:59.953
a word that is made up of two or more words
that can stand on their own.

00:03:59.953 --> 00:04:02.584
So let's unpack these a bit beginning  with bow.

00:04:02.584 --> 00:04:04.829
A decorative knot.

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.247
Here are some brand new headphones.

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:10.417
They're perfectly together, everything's fine,

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:12.509
and they're perfectly straight.

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:15.130
But quickly, after being in my pocket or in a backpack,

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.218
headphones inevitably tie themselves up into weird knots.

00:04:18.218 --> 00:04:21.469
The same goes for Christmas
tree lights and electrical wires.

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:26.019
Why does that happen?  I mean, are there some kind of like weird evil elf sneaking around

00:04:26.019 --> 00:04:28.569
when we're not looking tying wires into knots?

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:31.275
Maybe, but probably not.

00:04:31.275 --> 00:04:34.150
The answer lies in mathematics.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.528
Mathematicians have jiggled strings around inside boxes

00:04:37.528 --> 00:04:42.404
to determine not only what types of knots will randomly occur, but how often they will.

00:04:42.404 --> 00:04:44.791
And of course, what they found is that

00:04:44.791 --> 00:04:48.042
it's much more likely for a
string to fall into a knotted position

00:04:48.042 --> 00:04:51.007
that a relatively rare unknotted one.

00:04:51.007 --> 00:04:53.881
Furthermore, once a string is knotted,

00:04:53.881 --> 00:04:57.924
it resists being untied, which is
pretty much the definition of a knot.

00:04:57.924 --> 00:05:03.887
So it will remain knotted and twisted up until a person comes along and unties it.

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:05.848
But what about rain?

00:05:05.848 --> 00:05:10.730
Well, we know that rain is part of what's responsible for the visual experience of a rainbow,

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.489
but what about the ole factory sensation of rain—

00:05:15.489 --> 00:05:18.069
the smell of rain.

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:21.279
There's actually a name for the way rain smells.

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.118
It's called petrichor.

00:05:23.118 --> 00:05:25.658
Naturalists have given the smell of rain a name

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:29.498
because they have found a specific cause for the smell of rain.

00:05:29.498 --> 00:05:33.043
During dry times, plants exude in oil,

00:05:33.043 --> 00:05:37.009
and the point of this oil is to slow down seed germination and plant growth

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:39.223
so they can wait until there's more water.

00:05:39.223 --> 00:05:42.636
But once the rain comes, this oil is washed into the air

00:05:42.636 --> 00:05:46.425
and we smell it, creating petrichor—the smell of rain.

00:05:46.425 --> 00:05:51.149
So the next time you smell rain, think about this word Petrichorand where it comes from.

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:54.021
You're not just smelling nature or certain plant oils,

00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:58.822
you are smelling by definition the blood of stone,

00:05:58.822 --> 00:06:01.574
the blood of the earth, of the ground.

00:06:01.574 --> 00:06:03.992
And as always, thanks for watching.
