00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.920
Hey, Vsauce.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:11.330
Michael here. Skeletons are scary and
spooky, but you know what else is?

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.769
Teenagers.

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.410
Their attitude, the way they dress and
the music they listen to. Can you even call

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:28.809
it music? Pff, kids these days. But what are kids these days? What's with all the concern and what's a generation?

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:34.590
Why do we think that coevals, groups of
people of roughly the same age, act so

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.629
much alike? The sheer number of articles
and papers and internet posts published

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:47.020
daily comparing then and now,
both sincerely and ironically, is astonishing.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.530
We can't seem to get enough about kids
these days and just how different and

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.750
awesome it was to be a kid back in the
good old days.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.410
Generational labels make human history
look ordered and discreet, instead of scary

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.200
and messy. They also have a delightfully
suspicious tendency to flatter

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.009
those using them. George Orwell put it well.
"Every generation imagines itself to be

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.479
more intelligent than the one that went
before it, and wiser than the one that comes

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.190
after it."
There's a name for this sentiment.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:29.170
Juvenoia. Sociologist David Finkelhor
coined the term. It means "an exaggerated

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.420
fear about the things that influence
kids these days." Juvenoia is a

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:42.100
concerned disappointment that because of
iPhones or the Internet or TV or rock

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.360
music or those pesky horseless
carriages the world just isn't fit for

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.730
kids like it used to be.
Generational conflict really has been going on for

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:59.050
that long. After all, "honor thy [your] father and thy [your] mother" was an ancient commandant

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.190
for a reason.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.910
In the 4th century BC, Aristotle
remarked that youths mistakes are due to

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.370
excess and vehemence, they think they
know everything. Here's an engraving from

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:19.000
1627 admonishing the 'now,' compared to
the ways of 'old.' In the early 1900's

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.500
Romain Rolland complained that
the new generation of young people were,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.830
quote, "passionately in love with pleasure
and violent games, easily duped." New

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.940
people and the direction society is
headed in

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.720
has always been seen with some
disapproval. Xkcd famously collected a

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.820
brief history of juicy examples. In 1871,
the Sunday Magazine published a line

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.840
that may as well have been written today
about texting. "Now we fire off a

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.640
multitude of rapid and short notes,
instead of sitting down to have a good

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.610
talk over a real sheet of paper." And the
Journal of Education in 1907 lamented

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.160
that at a modern family gathering,
silent around the fire,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.600
each individual has his head buried in
his favorite magazine. The point is there's

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.280
nothing new under the Sun. Not even the
Sun, in fact. The Sun is believed to be a

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.150
third generation star. This constant
cycle of generation clashing can

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.940
sometimes sound like a broken record.
Are these commentaries really providing

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.790
insight

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.719
into the minds of future leaders or
prematurely judging a coeval based on

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:40.159
how it acts as teens? Despite the
incessant concerns otherwise, the

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:45.790
proverbial 'kids these days' seem to be
better off than ever before.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.950
Drug use is down, exercising is up,

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.139
math and writing proficiency have
increased, crimes committed by young

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.540
people have decreased, hate comments
reported by children have dropped, the

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.090
number of 9th to 12th graders who have
been in fights has dropped, and the

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.379
number of teens who fear attacks at school
has dropped. But still, juvenoia

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.820
persists.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.920
But why?

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.430
Well, it kinda makes sense. I mean,
children are the future of a species, so

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.660
it's reasonable to assume that nature
would select for features in a species

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.750
that cause adult members to prefer the
way they were raised and distrust

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.940
anything different. After all, parents, by
definition, were a reproductive success

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.050
for the species. They made new members. So
whatever choices and influences brought

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.030
them to that point must have been good
enough. Any deviation from that could be

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:52.490
a problem. So worrying about the young may
have been naturally selected, just like

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.270
eyes and fingers and breathing air and
pooping. But here's the thing.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.820
Our brains don't accurately remember the
past or apply memories fairly or

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:11.220
rationally. That kind of thinking has a
plethora of interesting causes. First, at

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.450
a social level, concerns for and about
the youth are often exaggerated, because

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.440
exaggerating is effective.
You'll generate greater mobilization around the

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.400
cause if you can convince people that
we're on the cusp of a crisis here, folks.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.500
Also, our increasingly connected world
means more potential contacts with

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.920
people outside the family, the tribe,
the neighborhood. Even though juvenile

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.760
problems often involve people the
juvenile already knows, stranger danger

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.960
is a more powerful fear. "My kids have
good friends, who are good influences, so

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.810
why should I worry?" can be replaced today
with "even so, people you don't know are

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:00.700
threats, so worry." Other reasons for
juvenoia are personal and often it's not so

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.710
much the world that's changed, it's you.
Are drivers today really worse than they

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.850
were when you were young or do you
simply have new responsibilities and

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:16.770
experience that makes you more aware of
dangers that were always there? We

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:22.860
remember the past abstractly. There just
isn't enough room in our brains or a vital

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.160
need for complete voracity when
recalling things. Thus, we are more likely to

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.020
remember the general way we felt in the
past, without the petty annoyances, more

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.580
salient still, for the present.
Secondly,

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:42.860
loss aversion and the endowment effect.
People perceive a loss as greater than an equal

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.730
gain. In one famous study, when asked how
much they would pay for a coffee mug,

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:52.210
people gave prices that were
significantly lower than what people

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.260
given the mug first said they'd be
willing to sell it for.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.070
This may play a role in how we value
what we already have - our memories and

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.180
favorites - over what's new.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.180
There's even neuroscience backing up
why new stuff seems so bad to you.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:14.190
It's called the reminiscence bump.
Storage of autobiographical memories,

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.340
memories about yourself,

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.550
increases during times of change.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.710
Incidentally, this is why you remember
exciting things as lasting longer than

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:29.540
they really did, but rarely remember
times of boredom in detail. I've

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:35.090
discussed before the ways in which this
causes us to feel like time slowed down

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:40.580
during particularly quick but
significant events. Anyway,

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:45.710
adolescence and early adulthood,
particularly ages 10 to 30, are major

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:50.230
times of change. Many important things
happened during those years that define

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:54.540
your identity. So, it's no surprise that
along with things that have happened

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.850
recently,

00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:01.050
memories from this bump period are
greater in number and more emotional. The

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:06.200
books and songs and movies and slang
words and behaviour you loved and used

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.950
during this time

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:12.970
correlates quite well with what you will,
when you're older, remember the most

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.289
fondly.

00:08:14.289 --> 00:08:20.189
As we can see, juvenoia is natural.
In fact, a healthy dose of it is

00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:24.610
important. There are plenty of things we
should be fired up about improving.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:29.789
What's sometimes lost though, when
explaining that juvenoia occurs in every

00:08:29.789 --> 00:08:34.979
generation is the fact that the nature
of juvenoia hasn't always been the same.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:42.620
The generation gap of antiquity, or of
the 1300's, wasn't the same as it is today.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.280
The more rapid speed of change may be
one reason, but another is the appearance

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:52.930
of a new type of creature around the
turn of the last century - the teenager.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:09:01.680
The word teenager wasn't even used as a
stage of life until 1922. John Savage's

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:08.550
'Teenage' is a fantastic read on how human
society sort of accidentally invented

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:13.850
the teenager. You see, as factories
generated new unskilled jobs,

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:19.360
young people could acquire something
neat - their own money. Suddenly, marketers

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.870
realized that products could be made for
the youth. They were no longer stuck with

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:29.480
what their parents decided on. Also,
the surge in immigration at the time

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:34.260
highlighted for a new generation the view
that identity wasn't something you're

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.880
stuck with. It's fluid, personal,

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.670
decided. Furthermore, calls for
compulsory education around that time,

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:47.329
that is, making it the law that children go to school,

00:09:47.329 --> 00:09:51.800
further solidified the segmented
identity of children by forcing them out

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:57.540
of the world at large and into common
places surrounded mainly by their coevals.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.260
In that environment they could
develop behaviors and opinions and

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:04.510
culture shared just with themselves.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:09.579
Compulsory schooling also increased
literacy in adolescence, which gave them

00:10:09.579 --> 00:10:15.810
all the more power to hear stories written
for them and about them in books

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.320
they could buy with their own money.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:24.500
Kids these days suddenly weren't just young
humans waiting for life experience, they

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.300
were separate beings with their own
culture and voice. A fact that caused

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.540
juvenoia to change from the edible
skirmishes of the past into the

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:38.700
full-fledged panics we know and love
today. This brings us to a bigger

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.660
question, though.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:45.110
Sure, you may say, that makes sense, but
even someone who didn't grow up in this

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:48.810
society could plainly see that in the
old days

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.150
culture wasn't as dumbed down as it is today.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:56.510
Things used to be made by the elites, for
the elites. Now they're made for the

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:01.180
masses who demand sensational atavistic
pablum instead of rational critical

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:08.700
thought, like scholars, and, well, you know, me.
Those examples sure are convincing but

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:14.680
the plural of anecdote isn't data.
You can pick different examples and argue

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:19.840
the opposite point. Mozart wrote poems
about farts. There is amazing work and there

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:25.490
is simple work made at all times in
history. In fact, as Steven Johnson points

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:30.600
out in "Everything Bad is Good for You," if
anything, when given the chance to buy or

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:35.950
participate as they choose, the tendency
we find in humans is a preference for

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:42.220
more cognitive demands, for smarter
entertainment. What it takes to keep up

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:46.390
with the increasing density and
intricacies of narratives in media these

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:46.960
days

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:52.060
is impressive. To be fair, of course,
beneath the stimulating organization

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.830
there is no substance anymore, right?

00:11:54.830 --> 00:12:01.390
I mean, here's what one noted critic said of
today's easy brainless mass culture. "We

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:05.590
do not turn over the pages in search of thought,
delicate psychological

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:10.640
observation, grace of style, charm of
composition, but we enjoy them like

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.100
children at play

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:20.060
laughing and crying at the images before
us." Wait, sorry, that's something literary

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:28.140
critic G. H. Lewes wrote about Dickens in
1872. The point is, taste is subjective.

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:33.500
Art to 1 percent is garbage to another.
You may dislike the language or violence or

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:38.070
morals depicted on TV today, but there's
no denying the fact that entertainment,

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:43.600
including popular entertainment,
is requiring more and more thinking on the

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:49.080
viewers' part than ever before.
Johnson created this visual comparing narrative

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:54.680
threads in episodes of different TV
shows over time, and this shouldn't be

00:12:54.680 --> 00:13:01.140
surprising. Our brains crave stimulation.
A lump that sits and stares into space isn't

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:06.710
naturally selected form in the same way
as a brain that learns and synthesizes

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:12.200
and organizes. Now that entertainment can
be made for niche audiences and watched

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.890
and re-watched on demand and discussed ad nauseam online that natural desire can

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:23.250
be sated by media. Johnson goes so far
as to say that reruns have made us

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:28.250
smarter. They've enabled entertainment to
be made that rewards being watched and

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:32.800
thought about over and over again.
The names and stories and relationships and

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.570
dramas people today have to keep
straight in their heads to be

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:40.060
functioning consumers of modern media
are impressive by historical standards

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:45.590
and affect more of us than ever before.
Johnson points out that in his time

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:53.190
Dickens was only read by 0.25% of his
country's population, while today

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:56.250
innovative shows like 'The West Wing' or
'The Simpsons'

00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:02.500
easily reach twenty times that
proportion. Okay, but how about this?

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:07.170
Where are the Mozart's and Dostoyevsky's
of today?

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:12.160
Well, they're probably here, but the
reputation of Dostoyevsky is built by time,

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:17.550
something the judgments of contemporary
artists haven't had enough of yet.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:22.470
Finally, when it comes to judging works
that merely tease the base emotions

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.450
let's not forget the quote from

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:31.670
Unamuno I've discussed before.
"More often have I seen a cat reason than laugh or weep."

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:38.570
Cats and humans are curious and can
problem solve, but only humans can laugh

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:46.100
at fart videos. So, what really ought we be treasuring?
There's a problem here, though. Although

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.630
writers like Johnson have been able to
put forth convincing arguments that

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:55.570
movies and TV have been serving more and
more cognitive complexity, they've failed

00:14:55.570 --> 00:15:01.780
to find the same evidence for pop music.
Nearly all studies on the subject have

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:07.680
found that, unlike other forms of popular
media, pop music has, in fact, become, since

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:12.740
the 1950's, less complex in its
structure and more homogeneous.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:18.329
Mathematically speaking,
more pop songs today sound alike

00:15:18.329 --> 00:15:21.779
than they used to.
What's up with that, music?

00:15:21.779 --> 00:15:28.769
Well, here's the thing. Pop music is just
one type of music being made today and

00:15:28.769 --> 00:15:32.629
it's role, what its its listeners want from
it and who they are

00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:37.069
are much more specific than the wider
spectrum of genres a movie theater or

00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:42.790
Netflix caters. A pop song needs to
provoke quick mood, stick into your head

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:49.439
and fit anticipation and pay off into a
fairly regular amount of time. There are

00:15:49.439 --> 00:15:54.470
only so many ways to do that. So, perhaps,
pop music producers have simply gotten

00:15:54.470 --> 00:16:00.519
better at scratching the specific itch
they're challenged to scratch.

00:16:00.519 --> 00:16:05.420
I mean, imagine criticizing doctors for using
penicillin nowadays.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.220
Uh, back in the good old days treatment was innovative.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:14.540
There were leeches and onion plasters, amputation
and good luck charms. Now it's all just

00:16:14.549 --> 00:16:20.189
penicillin, penicillin, penicillin.
It's all the same. Criticizing popular music

00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:27.910
for all sounding the same ignores the
sameness of every pop song's goal. But what

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:34.290
about generations? What are they exactly?
I mean, humans don't have babies all at

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:40.029
once every twenty years or so. New people
just keep showing up, about four more

00:16:40.029 --> 00:16:41.340
every second.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:46.470
But that said, there are biological
changes humans go through as they grow

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:52.870
and age, roughly creating a few life
stages. Alright? Now, this list of

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:58.030
generations goes all the way back to the
mid 1400's. It applies mainly to the

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:02.700
western world, especially the US, and is
the work of William Strauss and Neil

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.910
Howe, whose landmark 1991 book
"Generations," contains one of the most

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:13.390
influential and ambitious generation
theories of our time. These are the guys

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:17.510
who coined term 'millennial,' by the way.
They set forth and have continued to

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:23.790
expand a theory that society follows a
predictable cycle of moves, each lasting

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:28.790
about 20 years - about how long it takes
for everyone in a life stage to move on

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.090
to the next.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:34.760
The social mood and the common life
stage a coeval experiences it during are

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.560
what distinguishes one generation from
the next. Strauss and Howe call each

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.120
social mood

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:46.560
a turning. A turning describes the way
society will act, by either establishing,

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:53.360
accepting, challenging or fracturing in
lieu of established customs. To

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.690
illustrate the cycle, let's start just
after the American Civil War, in the

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:04.110
so-called Gilded Age. Here we find
American society in the first turning,

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:09.540
what they call a "high." This is a twenty year
period when society is largely in

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:13.250
agreement about the direction it wants
to go in, because it recently

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:18.430
coalesced in the face of a crisis.
Institutions are strong and thus young

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:21.660
adults are cautious and conformist.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:27.580
But then people tire of social
discipline and call for reform, a period

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:32.360
of awakening occurs. The majority
consensus is attacked in the name of

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:38.560
greater and broader individual autonomy.
The distrust in institutions left in the

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:45.520
wake of an awakening leads to the next
turning, an unraveling, where in place of

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:51.260
broad cultural identity, moral crusades
polarize society over what should come

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.580
next.

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:58.020
Finally, a renewed interest in consensus
that responds to crisis by banding

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:02.980
together occurs. Society's mood shifts to
a belief that coalescing and building

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:08.570
together are the answer. The cycle then
starts again with a high - the majority

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:12.970
agrees on society's directions and
institutions strengthened during the

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:19.050
crisis until people tire of this
majority structure and an awakening leaves

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:24.230
those institutions week and armed
with less public consensus. This is

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:28.500
followed by an unraveling, where
individuals polarize over moral issues

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.860
and the youth, raised in the previous two
atomizing moods,

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:38.540
feel alienated.
Which brings us to, well, today.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:43.530
Strauss-Haus theory, if true, tells us
that this will be an era where society

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:48.510
will band together and build
institutions from the ground up in the

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:53.360
face of crisis. It's not clear what that
crisis will be, but if their theory has

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:59.840
predictive power, the climax of that
crisis will occur in 2025. The whole

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.510
theory is a great way to learn about you
as history.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:06.490
Al Gore once even gave a copy of
Generations to every member of Congress.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:15.050
But it is unscientific and unfalsifiable.
You can find a pattern in anything if you pick and

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:16.760
choose the right examples.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:22.110
As for the usefulness of its
generalizations, well, Philip Bump points out that

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:28.580
the US Census Bureau only recognizes
one official distinguishable generation.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:36.210
Baby boomers. Do you think you are a
Generation X, a millennial, Generation Z?

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:41.130
Well, that's fine, he says, you call yourself
whatever you want. It's all made up. The

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:45.920
baby boomers are a cohort, significant
in that no matter where they were born

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.410
or who they are,

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:52.820
their size alone determines a lot about
their path. But other population segments,

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:57.980
based solely on birth year, just don't
mean much. A more useful way to divide them

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:02.630
into cohorts might focus on some other less
age-related trade that correlates

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:04.190
better with behavior.

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:07.370
Wealth, region, sexuality, etc.

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:11.810
Regardless of its accuracy there's one
thing generational theory and its

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:18.900
critics do at least agree on.
People change as they age and the larger

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:23.830
society surrounding people influences
the degree to which generations feel

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:29.620
conflict. So, generational thinking is a
kind of guidance.

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:33.830
It's one that helps take us on a journey,
manned by an ever changing and changing

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:39.390
crew. Some crews are different than
others, for sure, and you need worry and

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:45.460
concern to stay safe. But at the end of
the day, it's still the same boat and the

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:52.110
same waters. Generations and juvenoia
are like what Picasso said about art -

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:56.600
they are lies that tell the truth.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.960
And as always,

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.620
thanks for watching.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:18.940
Here's a bonus. While doing research I found a website
that will allow you to find what word was

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:26.130
first used the year you were born. It's
pretty cool. It's also a DONG. That's right,

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:31.030
something you can do online now, guys.
In fact, here's some DONG news for you.

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:35.290
The shows that you know and love on
the Vsauce network now have their

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:40.650
own home, where they can flourish and be
who they want to be. The channel's name is

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:46.040
DONG. Go over there right now to check it
out, we've got some cool things from the

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:49.880
Internet. That's what DONG's all about.
It's an Internet Safari. It's neat things that

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:55.980
we all find as we research for these episodes.
So I'll see you over there on DONG.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:57.940
And thanks for watching.
