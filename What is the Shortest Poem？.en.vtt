00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:03.659
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
I am in Green Bank,

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.779
West Virginia. Pocahontas County.
And my favorite word

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:08.999
is ...

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.820
I learned it from Big Bird and it's not so much a word

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.900
as the alphabet, if you try to pronounce it

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.840
like a word.
It's a neat trick, almost poetic.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.439
But what counts as poetry?
How short can something be and still be

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.290
a poem?
What is the shortest poem

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.460
in the world and why does knowing it

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.960
matter?

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.260
Okay, now I am in Charlottesville, Virginia

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.420
in a hotel room.
I'm on the road this week.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.420
Take a look at my amazingly fancy

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.520
set up.
A popular contender for the shortest

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.640
story in the world is apocryphally

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.550
attributed to Ernest Hemingway.
It contains only six

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.010
words.
"For sale. Baby shoes.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.780
Never worn."
A popular contender for the title of world's

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.610
shortest poem and the one honored at
WorldsShortestPoem.com

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.830
is a clever couplet attributed to Strickland

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.180
Gillilan, titled "on the Antiquity

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.259
of Microbes" or sometimes just

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.979
"Fleas".
It goes like this: " 'Fleas' /

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.200
Adam / Had 'em"
But shorter

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.780
rhyming couplets are possible.
Gyles Brandreth

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.170
wrote the very cute "Ode to a Goldfish."

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.710
"Oh, wet / pet"

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.060
Muhammad Ali composed an even shorter
rhyming couplet when he spoke at Harvard

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.370
in 1975.
Using just

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.470
4 letters, his poem poignantly sums up the power of

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.830
role models and leaders.
The idea that as one man climbs

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.740
the rest are lifted up.
The poem is simply

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.979
"me / we"

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.380
But a poem doesn't need to rhyme

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.430
or contain multiple words.
A poem is simply a type of literary

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.560
art that uses aesthetic or rhythmic
properties of a language to mean

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.670
more than it normally would.
With that definition in mind take a look at my

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.560
favorite

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.549
one word poem by Aram Saroyan.

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.660
The word light with an extra

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.540
"gh".
The poem became controversial because the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.959
NEA paid him $500

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.260
for the poem.
Critics berated it for its simplicity

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.050
but that only made it more famous and popular.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.840
Lighght. It's fun to type and it's fun to say because

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.780
what sound does the "gh" in the word "light"

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.250
really make?
Is this a lighter,

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.780
fluffier extended version of light or is it a

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.150
gargled, choking one?
We can get shorter

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.849
one letter poems.
Two of my favorites are

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.040
" 'fit' / n" and

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.209
" 'nought' / t".
Of course,

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.239
should the title count when measuring the length

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.580
of a poem?
Well, maybe.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.580
I like Geof Huth's two letter amalgam poem.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.879
The letter L with the letter Y on top of it,
making a brand new character.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.300
Now, of course an L and a Y is a great way to make an

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.080
adverb.
It's the difference between strange and strangely.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.459
Here, in this very poem,
we have the difference between

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.250
you and what you do in one

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.950
simple shape.
Before they stopped

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.470
tracking the record, the Guinness Book of
World Records considered Aram Saroyan

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.770
the

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.800
author of the world's shortest poem.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.000
Here it is.
The letter "m"

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.330
with an extra hump.
Is it

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.819
a letter or an image?
Some have called it

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.260
a close up of an alphabet being born.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.349
Its cells still in the process of dividing the

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:26.630
"m" and the "n", not quite separated.
But from what I've read,

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.099
in my opinion, the shortest poem

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:34.500
ever, the shortest use of language
aesthetically, arhythmically to mean more

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.690
than the word itself

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.340
is jwcurry's composition of the lower case letter

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.450
"i", dotted with his own

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.270
fingerprint.
The fingerprint makes it

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.700
his. "I" means me

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.680
but this one can only mean him.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.960
For fun, let's talk about situations in which language

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.430
isn't even used.
We are entering the realm

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.990
of poetry.
What Geof Huth calls

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.030
a moment when a writer writes

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.160
nothing instead of anything.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.160
R. W. Watkins composed a poem

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.410
that only suggested language.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.580
In reality, it simply contained places

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.070
where language could go.
There are also plenty of

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.930
empty musical compositions.
Songs

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.120
that are nothing, simply silence.
John Denver even composed one.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.880
His "Ballad of Richard Nixon" is silence

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.810
and you can buy it in the iTunes Store for 99 cents.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.009
But who cares?
Is knowing the world's shortest poem

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:52.860
just a neat piece of trivia, a cool thing
to tell your friends but in the end

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.150
a useless pub fact?
I mean,

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.720
the Guinness Book of World Records has
stopped compiling records for

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.160
artistic briefness.
What you're about to see is possibly

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.350
the shortest concert ever

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:13.680
put on. It was done by the White Stripes
in Newfoundland in 2007.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.990
Here it comes.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.470
And there it went. That's all.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.550
The Guinness Book of World Records
refused to recognize

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.069
that concert as being the shortest
because they said, quote,

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:30.099
"The nature of competing to make
something

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:34.159
the 'shortest' by its very nature
trivializes the activity

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:39.129
being carried, as such we have been
forced to cease listing records for the

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:40.220
shortest song,

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.930
shortest poem and indeed the shortest concert."

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.349
Trivializes?
Maybe.

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:53.430
But we can say and sing and write and
draw a lot of powerful

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.889
things, regardless of what authority recognizes

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:01.180
its size or lack thereof.
Appreciating the power carried by

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:06.819
even the tiniest poem is a great way to
put into perspective just how

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:10.430
cool that is.
When he died,

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.490
Fernando Pessoa left behind a chest

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.960
full of his thoughts and experiences written down.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.409
Decades after his death they were
published into "The Book

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:25.419
of Disquiet."
His thoughts and experiences

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:29.840
didn't die along with him, he had written
them down, he had narrated them

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.340
and in this book he discusses the power of narration

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.819
compared to simply existing, living,

00:07:36.819 --> 00:07:39.889
seeing, YOLO-ing.
He said,

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:43.180
"Direct experience is an evasion,

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.389
a hiding place for those without any

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:50.349
imagination. To narrate is to create,

00:07:50.349 --> 00:07:53.409
while to live is merely

00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:57.080
to be lived."
Anyone can live

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.650
a life.
His question would be what have you said

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.740
about it.
Even the world's shortest

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.270
poem is still a comment, a narration.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.360
Even the world's shortest poem, even

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.340
a silence that's purposeful and means something

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.880
can be mind-blowingly gigantic.
