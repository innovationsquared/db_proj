00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.950
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
In 2003, researchers did the measurements

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:12.950
and found that Kansas is in fact literally
flatter than a pancake.

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.090
Of course, the Earth is not flat, the Earth
is round.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.770
Otherwise travellers would be falling off
the edge all the time.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:21.510
Right?

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.320
Wrong.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.859
If the Earth was not a ball shaped, but was
instead a flat disk, like this plate, well

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.500
with the weight, density and thickness, living
in the middle could feel pretty normal.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.440
But as you move toward the edge, gravity on a disk Earth would slightly skew, pushing

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.180
at a greater and greater angle back toward the centre.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.300
My friend Nick from 'yeti dynamics' put together
this great simulation.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.940
The person and buildings obviously aren't
to scale but check out how such increasingly

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.480
diagonal gravity would work.
Although this is a flat disk, it would feel

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.000
to a runner headed toward the edge, like they were fighting to climb up a steeper and steeper

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.860
hill.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.720
The building foundations behind the runner

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.540
reflect how you would have to build structures, closer and closer to the edge, so that people

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.960
living in them always felt like down was at
right angles to the floor - the way we feel

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.120
it on our big, round Earth.
As you approach the edge, things would get

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.200
scary.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.700
Remember, this is a flat Earth, but it would

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.950
feel like a sheer drop off.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.950
What's really cool is that contrary to the

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.650
"don't fall off the edge" fear, on a flat
world because of gravity, the scary risk would

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.170
actually be falling away from the edge and
rolling all the way back to the centre.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.640
Once you stepped over the edge, instead of
falling off into space, you'd be able to relax.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.640
It would be a nice level place.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.100
This model, of course, neglects the fact that such

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.180
a planet shape would be impossible.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.680
Anything as massive as the Earth, shaped like

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.270
a flat disc, would, under its own gravity,
naturally collapse back into a ball.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.990
This is why in outer space everything more
than few hundred miles in diameter is round.

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.909
Or so we've been told.
What if gravity isn't real?

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:23.870
What if the Earth is, in fact, flat and science
has been wrong all along?

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.150
It's a misconception that Christopher Columbus
discovered that the Earth is round.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.439
Virtually every scholar and major religion
in the West accepted Earth's rotundity, since

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:39.959
at least the time of the Ancient Greeks, who,
for instance, had noticed that boats disappear

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.430
bottom first when sailing away.
And, as you walk north and south, stars pop

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.350
in and out of the view.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.600
The misconception that only a few hundred

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:55.719
years ago lots and lots of people believed
the Earth was flat likely began in the modern

00:02:55.719 --> 00:03:00.779
era, as a sort of insult.
Well, your people recently thought the Earth

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:06.299
was flat, so why should we believe you now?
The smear was repeated and published so often

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:13.299
it became accepted as historical fact.
"Flat-Earther" became synonymous with "Anti-science".

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.859
It might seem flat over short distances, but
over longer ones, well the Earth is pretty

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.239
darn curvy.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.500
The Verrazanoâ€“Narrows Bridge, connecting

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.730
Staten Island and Brooklyn, had to be designed
with Earth's roundness in mind.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:34.730
Its 2 towers, separated by 1300 metres, and
perfectly vertical, are nonetheless 41 milimetres

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.309
further apart at the top than at the bottom

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:41.309
because of Earth's curvature.

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:47.239
In the 3rd century BC, Eratosthenes measured
the differences between shadows cast by poles

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:54.239
in Syene and Alexandria to calculate, more
than 2000 years before rockets and space travel,

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:01.549
the circumference of the entire globular Earth,
with, for the time, impressive accuracy.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.779
Word got around that the Earth was a round
shape after that.

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:14.709
But in 1906, Wilbur Glenn Voliva became head
of a slightly bizarre religious sect that

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.489
pretty much ran the city of Zion, Illinois.

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.280
Voliva believed that the Earth was actually

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.020
flat and he enforced flat Earth's teachings
in schools in Zion.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.150
He also enforced that belief on really anyone
who entered the city.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.930
Voliva believed not only that the Earth was
flat, but that the sun was only few thousand

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.370
miles away from Earth.
Not 93 million.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:48.370
He also believed that the sun was only 32
miles across, not 860 000.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.669
He sounds crazy, or does he?
You see, the same phenomenon Eratosthenes

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.509
measured could be explained by a flat Earth,
if the sun were only few thousand miles away

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:04.470
and 32 miles across - the math would work
out the same.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.680
Today, with the power of the Internet, modern
day flat Earthers have picked up where Voliva

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.840
left off.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.580
They have quite good explanations for any

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.110
evidence you throw at them that the Earth is round.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.889
Circumnavigation is really just a flat circle path.

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.740
The round shadow Earth casts on the Moon during
a lunar eclipse could also be made by a flat

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.020
disc.
Time zones are caused by spotlight sun, and

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.470
remember how gravity would be totally different
on a disc-shaped planet?

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.080
Well, they argue that gravity, as we know
it, simply doesn't exist.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.939
The flat disc of Earth is merely accelerating
up at 9.8 metres per second.

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:50.620
As for all of the photos and video evidence
we now have that the Earth is round, thanks

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.110
to space exploration, well all of that material
is completely fabricated.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:02.110
A hoax, perpetrated by Big Globe.
Space agencies, airlines, globe manufacturers.

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:07.530
They are reaping the rewards of our ignorant
belief that the Earth is actually round.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.469
They know, of course, that it's flat.
And they're hiding that truth from us.

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:17.469
Is it merely a coincidence that the logo used
by the Flat Earth Society is a projection

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:22.569
of Earth, centred on the North Pole, and also
happens to be the projection used by the United

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:23.809
Nations?

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.540
Are these people for real?

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:32.020
Probably not most of them.
But this is the crocks of Poe's Law.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:39.140
An adage that states that at their extremes,
parody of extremism and sincere extremism

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.170
are difficult to distinguish.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.260
Although clever, flat Earth theories are predominantly

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.960
ad hoc explanations - excuses made up on the
spot that only address one issue and don't

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.880
fit all the evidence.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.749
Science, of course, rejects a theory if a

00:06:55.749 --> 00:07:01.879
better one fits more of our observations,
but why the egoistical obsession with OUR

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.580
observations?

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.139
A cosmic ray particle could use the very same

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:12.580
scientific method we use and conclude that
the Earth was, in fact, flat.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:18.409
You see, at speeds near the speeds of light,
time slows down and lengths contract.

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:22.639
One way we know this is that unstable muons,
created in the upper atmosphere by the collision

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:28.349
of cosmic rays with the atmosphere, should
mostly decay before reaching Earth's surface.

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:35.319
But yet, we detect a lot of them down here,
because they're crazy fast speed literally

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:41.430
means that, from our perspective, their physics
runs according to a slower clock; and to them,

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:47.229
the distance they have to cover to the surface
during their short lives is, from their perspective,

00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:53.180
much much shorter than it appears to us.
If you're a cosmic ray proton travelling at

00:07:53.180 --> 00:08:03.779
99.9999999999991% the speed of light, Earth
would appear to be only 17 metres thick in

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:05.639
the direction you travel.

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:10.599
So Earth is flat to them, but round to us.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.360
It is ball shaped to some observers and flat to others.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:22.669
There doesn't appear to be a single most correct-est,
in all circumstances, answer.

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:26.569
Susan Haack compares knowledge to a crossword puzzle.

00:08:26.569 --> 00:08:30.620
New answers interweave with old ones, they
all reinforce one another.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:35.640
The clues are the questions we ask, and the
way the answers fall into a predetermined

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.700
grid, well, that's our confidence that we're
on the right track.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:45.190
But that doesn't mean one day there will be
a finished puzzle - a complete answer.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:51.600
Recall The New York Times famous 1996 crossword
puzzle that came out the day before the US

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:58.600
election between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole.
The clue for 39 across was pretty crazy.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.220
You seemed to need to be able to tell the
future to answer it correctly.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.200
It simply said,

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.620
"Lead story in tomorrow's newspaper

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.620
(blank) elected".

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:15.750
Well that blank could be Clinton or Bob Dole
and who's to say which one until tomorrow?

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:21.340
There's no way to know.
But, as it turned out, the answer was Clinton,

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.380
or Bob Dole.
No matter which you wrote in, all the other

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:28.090
clues fit.
For instance, a "black Halloween animal" could

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.310
either be a cat or a bat.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.100
Our knowledge about the outside world might

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.420
be the same.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.400
A puzzle with no answer key, just the reassurance

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:43.830
that the answers we think we know fit together,
so they're probably correct.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:48.450
Though there's always the possibility that
the answer to one clue, or all of them, will

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:53.250
fundamentally not have a single definite satisfying answer.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.810
The puzzle may be playable forever.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.050
I like what Richard Feynman says about this.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:06.060
"Some people say 'How can you live without
knowing?' I do not know what they mean. I

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:13.070
always live without knowing - that is easy.
How you get to know is what I want to know."

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.720
You know?

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.760
And as always,

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.760
thanks for watching.
