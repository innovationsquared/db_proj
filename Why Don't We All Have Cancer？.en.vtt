00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.600
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.330
Since this video began

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.770
more than a million of your cells have

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.790
died. It's natural, don't worry.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.090
But you are literally covered with death

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.660
Dead stuff. Fingernails, your hair,

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.100
the outermost layer of your skin - all
made out of dead things.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.170
And you are losing this dead stuff
constantly. Every week

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.070
about 5.5 grams of dead skin sheds off of your body.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.149
Ohio State University found that 80%

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.520
of that material you see indoors,
beautifully dancing across sunbeams,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.610
is dead human skin.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.760
But for the most part, you are made out of

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.059
living stuff. You are a biological

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.719
furnace, burning food energy to move and breathe and

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.079
think and stay warm. As you can see on
Grand-Illusions[.com], the heat from your own

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.010
hand while you sit still

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.590
is enough to run a Stirling engine.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.140
Your cells are busy and active and dividing

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.049
millions and millions of times every day.
In fact, because of that, you shouldn't even

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.610
really be called a person.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.090
You should be called a persON

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.380
and on and on and on and on and on and
on and on... But here's the really

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.299
mind-blowing

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.520
thing about the mind sustaining process of cell division,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.729
the replication of instructions.
DNA for each daughter cell

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.100
requires copying an exact sequence

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.909
of three billion nucleotides. That's a lot.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.150
Luckily, our bodies are perfect-ly happy
to do it but they're not perfect.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.250
Every time a single cell in your body
divides, the enzymes that synthesize

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.170
your DNA

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.540
make 120,000 mistakes.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.780
Some of these mistakes

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.350
wind up being beneficial. Some of these
mistakes wind up being harmful and

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.720
some are just neutral,

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.939
they don't make a difference.
But if a mistake,

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.790
a mutation in a cell's DNA, causes the
cell to behave abnormally

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.239
and stimulate its own growth, ignore signals to stop,

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.730
stimulate the body to give it its own
blood supply, potentially

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.250
multiply forever and unstick from
where it began to spread throughout the body,

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.530
it becomes a special type of cell.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.180
We have found 200 diseases with various
origins and natures that

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.810
fit this description. Despite being
different, they often go by the same name:

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.880
cancer.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.220
DNA mutations occur randomly in your body

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.890
but they can also be inherited or caused
by the environment.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.890
For example, exposure to ultraviolet
radiation from the Sun

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.170
can cause all kinds of damage,
including genetic damage.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.480
If little or no skin protection is
used, the accumulation of all these types of damage

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.170
can be quite dramatic. This man drove a truck

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.870
for years, exposing one side of his face to more sunlight

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.030
than the other.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.200
And for 15 years this woman worked in a room

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.540
that had the same window. A window to her left.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.080
Environmental damage to the body,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.360
whether cancer-causing or not, is serious business.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.980
In fact, giraffes have black tongues
because the dark pigmentation protects

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:22.830
their tongues

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.890
from solar radiation while they're hanging out all day.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.830
Go back far enough, beyond where sunshine
hits, and their tongues are pink.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.799
Given the sheer number of environmental
dangers to our DNA

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.200
and the sheer number of mistakes our own
bodies make with our DNA every day,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.819
it is incredible that we all aren't
developing cancers constantly

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.260
and immediately after being born.
One of the things we have to thank

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.360
is our body's own version of autocorrect.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.030
Biological mechanisms, like proofreading
and mismatch repair,

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.030
catch and correct or stop more than 99% of errors.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.680
We grow old and pass away for many,

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:05.250
many reasons.
But when it comes to cancers, our bodies'

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.989
own internal autocorrect is like the autocorrect

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.299
on your phone. It's pretty good, but it's
not perfect. Cancers

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:18.799
still develop, especially after the
accumulation of mistakes and mutations

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.939
over time. I'm incredibly grateful to
Cancer Research UK.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.000
They helped me a lot with this
episode, and thanks to work by groups like them,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.449
we are at an accelerating rate finding
ways to prevent and control cancer

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.250
beyond what our bodies can do alone.
I mean, after all, natural selection can

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.990
only see so much

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.690
because of the selection shadow.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.080
We aren't all the same and if your genetic
variations make you and your children

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.610
more successful at reproducing,

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.810
well, what do you know, your
characteristics become more common.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.810
But this phenomenon has a weak influence

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.780
here. Later in life, after your role in
reproduction and raising offspring to

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.050
independence

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.430
has passed.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.620
We have found evidence of the selection shadow

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.650
at work with mice and bats.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.699
Raised under perfect conditions, with
veterinary medicine and safe lives,

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.030
mice only live about two to three years.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.039
Whereas bats, with similar sizes and
metabolisms, can live for

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.860
thirty years or more. The significant
difference here is that

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.480
unlike mice, bats have had in the wild
for millions of years

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.780
fewer predators - a smaller chance of dying early

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.600
due to extrinsic mortality. They've, on
average, had more days for natural selection

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.729
to influence. This could be a very good
explanation for why diseases that affect

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.930
our complex multicellular selves

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.630
late in life are still with us.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.900
But wait, why are humans living so long today?

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.400
I mean, in the past, but genetically recently, weren't

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.330
teenagers considered middle aged?

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.919
Not really. Well, it's true that in the
past life expectancies were quite

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.180
a bit lower, a life expectancy is merely an

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.880
average number of years a person was
expected to live as soon as they were born.

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.979
And in the past, infant mortality was so high

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.889
the average was brought down
significantly. It's true that in the

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:23.490
early 1600s, here

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.520
in England, life expectancy was only 35 years.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.590
But if you made the age of 21... Well,

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.190
you could easily expect to live well into your 60s.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.590
Lifespans that go beyond the age of reproduction have

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.380
always made sense for humans,
because we are intelligent

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.850
and social, useful to one another and our children

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.759
take a lot of time and guidance to gain independence.

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:52.979
But that just moves the selection shadow ahead. 
It's still there,

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:56.509
suggesting that, in the end, our bodies might just be

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:00.069
tools our sex cells use to reproduce

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:04.870
and grow up to do it again. Nature and
time haven't helped our bodies battle

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.970
late acting diseases because a chicken

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:12.050
is just an egg's way of making another egg.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.639
But maybe not for long. Our minds and
modern science technology engineering

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:19.199
and mathematics are making progress

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:22.699
against late acting diseases.
And when it comes to cancers,

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:26.360
Cancer Research UK points out that 40 years ago

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.990
only one in four people lived ten years or longer

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.090
after being diagnosed.
Today that number is 2 in 4.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.950
And they believe that in only twenty years
that statistic could be as high as 3 in 4.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.620
Refrigeration and sanitation are
tackling stomach cancers caused by infection,

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:48.129
vaccines are preventing cervical cancer,
anti-smoking campaigns and reductions

00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:50.410
of obesity and diabetes and the elimination

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.780
of cancer-causing chemicals from our
everyday lives are giving us an edge.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.270
We learn more every single day. The process

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.310
is slow, but steady. Because cancer is not just

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:06.330
one thing. It's unlikely there will ever
be a single cure for cancer because

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.569
there are two hundred different types

00:08:08.569 --> 00:08:13.240
of cancers. But there will be cures and
better methods of prevention

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.610
and detection.
Advances are coming from all over.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.639
For example, what we have learned about
controlling proton beams because of the

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:22.289
Large Hadron Collider

00:08:22.289 --> 00:08:26.539
has reduced the need for special shields
during the removal of eye tumours.

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:30.879
The statistical surprise that cancers
aren't more common in our bodies

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:33.899
is a sign that we're involved in a relay race.

00:08:33.899 --> 00:08:37.950
Natural selection already did some of the
work, now it's our turn.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.550
When we talk about cancer
we often use the language of war:

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:44.720
it's a battle, it's a fight.
But the challenge

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.540
isn't so much a war with winners and
losers and surrender

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:53.940
as it is a mutiny.
We can't help the fact that we are all at sea.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.500
Natural selection at least gave us boats

00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:00.089
but now we are making where those boats go

00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:01.849
our decision.

00:09:01.849 --> 00:09:03.069
And as always,

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:04.880
thanks for watching.
