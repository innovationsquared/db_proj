00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.660
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.639
A few years ago

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.200
in Minneapolis an angry dad stormed
into the retail store

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.580
Target.
His daughter, a high schooler,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.839
had been receiving coupons in the mail
from the store for things like cribs

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.779
and diapers.
Was Target encouraging his daughter,

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.459
a minor, to go out and get pregnant?
well

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.700
Well, the store apologized but a few days
later they heard back from the father. He

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.449
told them

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.860
"a few things have been going on in my household

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.500
I was unaware of. My daughter is due

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.700
in August. I owe you an apology."
You see,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.520
Target's internal algorithms have been tracking

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.039
and processing his daughter's purchases and recently

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:51.260
she'd started buying different items than usual.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.180
Things like certain vitamin supplements
and scent-free soaps and lotions.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.770
Behaviors the system flagged as evidence

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.559
she could be pregnant, thus they her sent the coupons.

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.350
And they were right.
Without being told,

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.150
Target knew that a girl was pregnant

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.930
before her own father.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.700
We are tracked and followed digitally now more than

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.310
ever before.
We live in a world of 24/7 CCTV,

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.880
browser cookies, trackable debit cards
and cell phones and GPS,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.640
fingerprinting and DNA analysis.
But despite

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.070
all of that, every single year

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.479
in the United States alone more than 2,000 people

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.439
disappear and are never found again

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.219
dead or alive.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.740
Where do missing people go?
How did they disappear?

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.860
What if you disappeared and

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.969
how do you know you haven't already

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.530
disappeared?
In many cases, missing persons are the victims

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.579
of unsolved or unknown crimes.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.050
They may have suffered accidents
or taken their own lives

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.450
and their bodies were never found.
Or they may be perfectly fine and have simply

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.280
escaped their old life, old friends and
family, old debt and obligations to start

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.030
a new life

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.220
somewhere else, possibly as someone else.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.930
How long would it take for people to notice

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.390
if you disappeared?
Well, think about it. I mean,

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.980
it sort of depends on who you are, how you live

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.970
and how you disappeared.
In most jurisdictions after about five to seven

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:43.819
years,

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.150
if no one has heard anything from you at all,

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.230
you can be declared dead in absentia.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.830
This is what happened to French astronomer

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.160
Guillaume Le Gentil.
In the 18th century hundreds
of people traveled far and wide

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.340
to observe the transit of Venus from different locations

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.400
on earth. They knew that by comparing their
measurements they could calculate

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.680
more accurately than ever before just how far away

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.300
the Sun was.
So, Le Gentil

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.840
left Paris in 1760 for Pondicherry

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.680
in India.
But after a storm blew him off course

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.840
and the British occupied Pondicherry,
he was forced to spend the day

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.409
of the transit on a boat at sea, which rocked

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.049
too much for accurate measurements to be taken.
Now, the next

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.360
transit would happen in 8 years.
But after that, the next

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.480
next transit wouldn't happen for another 100 years.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.180
So, he stuck around. He didn't return to Paris.
Instead, he built an observatory

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.860
and waited.
When he finally returned

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.610
to Paris, 11 years after leaving,
he found that he had been declared

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.140
dead.
His wife had remarried,

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.879
his family had plundered 
his belongings and his position

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.629
at the Royal Academy of Sciences
had been given to someone else.

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:08.689
He never did see the transit of Venus,

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:12.280
by the way.
On the day that it happened, the sky above him

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.640
was overcast.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.470
We know the human population

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.330
of Earth.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.940
Kind of.

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.340
Population figures and counters are only estimations.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.169
Individuals are best accounted for by real people

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.550
in their real lives.
But that doesn't always

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.970
happen.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.760
Earlier this year Janet Veal
passed away in her apartment

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.140
in Ringwood, Hampshire.
Large portions of her body

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.660
were eaten by her pet cats before she was discovered

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.810
weeks later.
And seven years ago

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.150
Joyce Carol Vincent was found dead on her sofa,

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.030
in Wood Green; or at least her skeleton

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.440
was found.
She'd been dead for at least three

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.480
years and no one ever checked on her.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.510
Her television was still on.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.560
And four days after Timothy McVeigh bombed

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.400
a federal building in Oklahoma City, taking

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.420
168 lives, a severed

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.390
left leg was found in the rubble.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.250
No one knew who it belonged to.
The legs of all the other victims had been

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.210
accounted for

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.390
and no one else had been reported missing.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.020
DNA analysis showed that the leg
belonged to a Lakesha Levy,

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.420
but she had already been buried with both her legs.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.070
So, they dug up her corpse.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.400
She'd been buried with someone else's left

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.440
leg. The legs were swapped, 
but because her body had been embalmed,

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.740
DNA in the unknown leg could not be analyzed.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.360
To this day no one knows who that leg

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.510
belongs to. The 169th

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.620
victim remains a mystery.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.460
Some conspiracy theorists argue that
the leg may have belonged

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.860
to be actual bomber,
someone besides Timothy McVeigh,

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.780
who was close enough to the explosion
to be obliterated completely,

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.660
except for one leg.
Regardless,

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.010
what it does show is that it is possible
for a person to disappear

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.120
without anyone ever asking where they went.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.980
Sometimes people are reported dead or missing

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.590
even when they aren't.
Premature obituaries

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.469
are common.
Many living people already have one on file.

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:46.340
If a famous person dies, 
the media, television, newspapers, magazines, well

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.550
they need a full story as soon as possible.
So, they

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.919
prepare them ahead of time, locked away,
leaving only the dates and circumstances

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:56.560
of the death to be filled in.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.930
Makes sense, but it's awkward

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.340
when they leak before the person's dead.
In 2003

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:10.189
CNN's website accidentally carried draft
obituaries for living people that could

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.639
be

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:14.000
accessed.
It's embarrassing, but

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.469
for the person reading their own
obituary, it's a chance to do something

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:20.479
that most of us never get a chance to do.

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:25.089
See how you will be remembered after you're gone.

00:07:25.089 --> 00:07:29.029
Alfred Nobel invented dynamite.

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:32.180
He made a fortune manufacturing and selling

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.379
deadly weapons - cannons and armaments.
In 1888

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:41.060
his brother Ludvig died but many
newspapers mistakenly thought that he

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.819
had died

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:44.830
and published obituaries for Alfred

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.529
Nobel.
They weren't very flattering.

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:52.009
One French paper declared 
"The merchant of death

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:55.289
is dead."
Nobel read these

00:07:55.289 --> 00:07:59.860
obituaries and was so ashamed by
what his legacy apparently

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.360
was going to be.
When he did die, he left almost

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.219
all of his money to the cause of celebrating humanity.

00:08:07.219 --> 00:08:11.789
He created The Nobel Prize.
Marcus Garvey

00:08:11.789 --> 00:08:15.569
wasn't so lucky.
The story goes that after suffering

00:08:15.569 --> 00:08:19.979
a stroke newspapers ran premature obituaries that

00:08:19.979 --> 00:08:23.149
were critical of him, saying, he died broke,

00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:28.430
alone and unpopular.
Shocked by how negatively he was being remembered

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:33.690
Garvey suffered another stroke while
reading his own obituary

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:38.300
and died.
In April of 2006

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:43.110
five Taylor University students died
in a tragic car accident.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.589
Another student survived, but was in a coma.

00:08:46.589 --> 00:08:50.019
She was identified as Laura van Ryn.

00:08:50.019 --> 00:08:54.120
Her friend Whitney Cerak wasn't as lucky.
She was pronounced

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.660
dead.
A thousand people attended her funeral

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.990
but over the next few days as Laura

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.569
recovered, she began speaking
and when asked her name,

00:09:04.569 --> 00:09:09.140
Laura said my name is Whitney.
The girls

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.250
looked similar.
It turned out Laura

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.630
was the one they had buried.
Later, Whitney

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.709
was married in the very same church that years before

00:09:18.709 --> 00:09:23.370
had held her funeral.
What if you are already missing

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:28.410
and just don't know it?
It's not known how often hospitals

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:31.750
accidentally switch babies at birth.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:36.440
Modern hospital policies make it
unlikely to happen, but because we don't

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.399
all go out and get maternity

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:42.519
and paternity tests for fun,
there isn't a lot of data

00:09:42.519 --> 00:09:47.660
on the phenomenon. But it does happen.
It's often discovered because of DNA tests

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.100
administered to resolve child support disputes.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.120
Or, in the case of the 35-year-old woman,
in the Canary Islands,

00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:00.810
it's because in 2001 an employee at a
store you're shopping at mistakes you

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:04.760
for her best friend - because you look exactly

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.060
like her, because she is

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.670
your long-lost twin, separated from you

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.730
since birth.
And the sister you grew up with,

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:19.620
thinking was your twin, turns out to be a biological

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.290
stranger.
What if you are missing

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.380
but the authorities don't know?

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.519
Such is the life of the unreported

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:33.209
missing.
People in a country illegally,

00:10:33.209 --> 00:10:36.579
people estranged from their family and friends with no

00:10:36.579 --> 00:10:39.829
missing person report ever being filed,

00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:44.250
children of homeless mothers.
These people aren't just

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.290
missing, they are what is known as

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.570
missing missing.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:52.860
The FBI's National Crime
Information Database contains

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:57.149
approximately 50,000 reported missing children,

00:10:57.149 --> 00:11:01.449
but Outpost For Hope reports that
there are more than a million

00:11:01.449 --> 00:11:05.189
children in America who are missing, without anyone

00:11:05.189 --> 00:11:09.500
knowing they're missing.
It is not against the law

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.790
to go missing under your own volition.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:15.860
You might have debts to pay or contracts to honor,

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.790
but if you are an adult, the act of disappearing

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:23.899
is not illegal in and of itself.
You have the right

00:11:23.899 --> 00:11:27.199
to go missing.
But believing that no one would

00:11:27.199 --> 00:11:32.649
miss you? That is ridiculous and unscientific.
Statistics

00:11:32.649 --> 00:11:35.970
would suggest otherwise.
David Wong

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.990
wrote one of the most powerful articles I've ever read.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.520
There is a lot of information

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.560
out there.
There's even a word for it - infobesity.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.480
It takes a lifetime to even

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.860
experience some of it.
It's easy to think  that everyone

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:58.200
knows everything that you know.
But every year

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.779
more than 100 million new people are
born and not a single one of them is

00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:03.500
born

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.880
knowing that they are made out of atoms 
or that black holes

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.029
are awesome.
Someone needs to be there

00:12:11.029 --> 00:12:14.339
to tell them, to show them.

00:12:14.339 --> 00:12:17.540
How many jokes do you hear every day,

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.680
every week?
How many jokes do you hear

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.700
every year?
Here's a fun thought.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:27.000
By considering average life expectancy

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.620
and the typical number of jokes
a person hears in a year,

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.649
David Wong posited a thought, rough

00:12:33.649 --> 00:12:37.180
in its approximation, but sharp in its essence.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.459
If you are under the age of 38

00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:43.500
odds are the funniest joke

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:48.300
you will ever hear is a joke
you haven't even heard yet.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.420
And, if you are over the age of 38,

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:56.250
odds are you already know a joke that
to more people than you could ever

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:57.370
possibly meet

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:01.180
might be the funniest joke
they will ever hear.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.810
So, wherever you are, we're glad you there.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.380
And as always,

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.580
thanks for watching.
