00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.120
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
But what could be

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.920
out there?
The likelihood of extraterrestrial intelligence

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.500
has been the subject of an equation and the current lack

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.580
of any communication with aliens the subject

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.660
of a paradox.
But here's a different question. If we were to hear

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.340
from intelligent life beyond earth, what would really

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.779
happen next?
Well, no government

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.380
has ever officially adopted a post-detection policy.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.460
And when asked how they would deal with
a confirmed message from

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.360
extraterrestrial intelligence,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.620
the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.760
simply said that their job does not
include any issues regarding

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.039
the question you pose.

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.210
So are we unprepared? Would chaos ensue?

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.539
These things are unlikely but the way

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:00.789
we prepare for, and anticipate our
species encountering one from beyond

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.510
earth, is important and illuminating even though

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.869
improbable.
Historically, we have

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.750
acted as though alien life exists.
Back

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.630
contamination is a concern that a
man-made object returning from space

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.509
could carry with it undiscovered alien
life forms, especially

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.990
viruses and bacteria that could wipeout

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.119
life on earth.
This was a serious concern

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.290
dealt by serious people when we first sent

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.520
humans to the Moon.
When Neil Armstrong,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.799
Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin
returned from the lunar surface,

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.460
they didn't immediately hugged their
families and join a public parade.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.860
Instead, they were sealed up in
biological isolation garments and flown

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.680
to a quarantine facility to be locked
away for three weeks,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.790
in Houston, Texas.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.729
By Apollo 15 the practice was
discontinued but forward contamination

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:58.450
has also

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.680
been a real concern. When NASA sent the
Galileo spacecraft to serve a Jupiter

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.750
and its moons, it got amazing data

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.850
but there was a problem.
It had never been

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.810
sterilized.
Because life, even liquid water, could exist

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.840
on these moons, NASA made the decision to
avoid contaminating an

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.310
alien biosphere and the mission was over,
steered Galileo

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.280
into Jupiter, where it burned up and was destroyed,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.310
along with any Earth life possibly.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.690
on board.
So protocols and decisions have been officially made in

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.519
the past

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.269
under the assumption that aliens might exist.

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.540
When it comes to actually hearing from aliens,

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.110
receiving a message from
technologically advanced life forms,

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.350
capable of sending us

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.750
say, a radio signal, groups like SETI,

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.660
the search for extraterrestrial
intelligence, are other ones actively

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.470
listening.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.989
They have an ear to the sky.
And they

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.000
are prepared. The SETI committee of the
International Academy of Astronautics

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.489
created a declaration of principles
concerning activities following

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.110
the detection of extraterrestrial intelligence.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.420
No government has officially adopted
any of its recommendations,

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.220
but if something were to happen,
it would likely be the first place

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.390
authorities went.
It's one of the only handbooks

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.079
they'd have. Seth Shostack explained the
philosophy in atmosphere at SETI,

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.680
predicting that because verifying a signal is slow,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.700
and the media are fast, you will be media
blasted about a possible detection

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.230
days before the people who find it are
certain it's for real.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.280
In the midst of rampant media speculation,

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.410
elation and panic on the part of the public,

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.660
the most likely string of official events,

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.480
after the discovery of a message from
extraterrestrial life,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.640
would follow SETI recommendations.
First of all,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.709
the individual or team who discovered the message

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.489
would continue to assess the credibility of the message

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.650
and alert all parties to SETI's declaration.
Next,

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.139
once they were certain the message was
real, the Central

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.489
Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams would be alerted,

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.530
so as to inform observers all over the world.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.860
They would also inform the secretary-general

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.110
of the United Nations, because article 11

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.190
of the treaty on principles governing
the activities of states in the exploration

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.840
and use of outer space,
including the Moon and other bodies

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.680
says they should.
The first official news

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.440
we got, the public, would likely be in terms

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.840
of the Rio Scale.
First presented to the International

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.570
Astronautical Congress, the Rio Scale measures

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.340
the significance of consequences of
evidence of extraterrestrial life,

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.960
making it a likely tool to be used,
because it neatly manages public

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.669
reaction. There's a great online
calculator you can play with to see how

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:01.870
the Rio scale

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.949
works.
It takes into account the credibility of the message

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:09.280
on a scale from believed extraterrestrial origin to

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.389
hoax, how repeatable the observation is,

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.389
what type of message it is, for instance,
is it uninterpretable

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.990
or clearly for us and how far away it is.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.460
Is it extra galactic or near enough that
we could respond and hear back

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.900
within the length of a human lifetime.
Seth Shostak and Ivan Almar

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.419
applied the Rio scale to fictional and historical

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.160
events. It's a great way to get a feel for
how the Rio scale will affect

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.280
vocabulary

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.800
authorities use when reporting on an extraterrestrial

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.000
message.
They considered the Moon monolith,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.310
discovered in 2001: A Space Odyssey, a

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.560
6 on the Rio scale - noteworthy.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.720
In the movie Independence Day,
the initial unidentified signal would be

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.150
about

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.290
4 to 8, moderate too far-reaching.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.740
Once the message is confirmed to be no
further than the Moon and moving,

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.080
it would be an automatic 10, extraordinary.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.789
In real life, the Martian Face, discovered in 1976,

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:15.840
was a 2 - low. Until high resolution
images from 2001 revealed it was

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.370
nothing, just a thing that looked funny
under the right conditions

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.349
and was immediately downgraded to zero, no

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:27.530
significance.
So if we were to receive a message from

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.949
extraterrestrial intelligence,
those things in those words

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:36.319
would likely be used.
But who would be in charge?

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:40.449
Although she denies ever being selected
or prepared for such a role,

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:43.900
Mazlan Othman, the director at the
United Nations Office for Outer Space

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.370
Affairs

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.469
is a pretty good candidate.
As is Paul

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:52.560
Davies, the chairman of SETI's post
detection task force.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.229
Were it to be necessary, both of those
people are in positions to become

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:00.319
ambassadors for earth-alien

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:03.629
relations.
So what do we say back?

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:07.180
Well, if we want to show that we are
intelligent, perhaps we should send back

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.259
a string of information representing Pi

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:14.580
or the Fibonacci sequence.
Or

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.870
maybe we shouldn't say anything at all.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.030
Stephen Hawking warned, quote,

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.610
"If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:28.590
as when Columbus landed in America,
which didn't turn out well

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.840
for the Native Americans."
And professor Simon Conway Morris,

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.180
a Cambridge University palaeontologist has said that

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.300
if the cosmic phone rings,

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.780
we shouldn't pick it up.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.860
Observations like that

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:50.000
are at the core of the importance of
this video's question. We can learn a lot

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.930
by looking, not just at how we prepare for
a space message,

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.660
but how we imagine actual contact with aliens

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.110
going.
Anthropologist Katherine Denny

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:05.690
frequently points out that the ways we
imagine a contact with aliens

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.280
happening often says more about ourselves

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.300
than it does any hypothetical aliens.
We do this

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.840
all the time.
When we project our own
modern-day ambitions and fears onto

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.440
prehistoric people,

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.580
Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá call that

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:26.620
"flintstoning."
So let's piggyback off of that phrase

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:31.450
and label any projection of modern human
behaviors, desires, anxieties

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:35.810
onto futuristic, technologically advanced
beings capable of visiting us

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:40.120
"jetsonsing."
Some examples of jetsonsing involve

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.120
thinking that any aliens out there
trying to contact us

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:49.150
might want to hurt us. Maybe that's
simply because whenever we have met new

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:49.800
people,

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.900
we often enslave them or

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.870
pity them or take advantage of them.
It's also possible to think that aliens

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:58.950
will be friendly.

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:03.040
They'll want to help us.
The ways we imagine them helping us

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.170
say a lot about the kind of help we
think we need.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.170
There's a poetic idea that from space Earth

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:12.770
looks peaceful.
All of the boundaries we have put

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:16.930
up don't exist, you can't see them.
But that's not

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:21.900
entirely true.
The old boundary between East and West Germany

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.750
is still visible from space,
each side using different

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:30.120
lightbulbs.
And this is the boundary between Pakistan

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.400
and India.
You can see from space India

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.620
flooding the border with lights to
deter smugglers from bringing across

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.640
weapons

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.000
and ammunition.
We don't all get along together here

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.810
on earth, we are afraid of each other,
we don't trust each other

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.900
and the wrinkles and scars that causes

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.920
are visible from space.
Imagining how

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.670
aliens would interpret that,
communicate with us and how we would

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.730
or should respond teaches us

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:03.150
a lot about ourselves.
It makes our struggles

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.810
strange again.
Less ignorable. And that is the entire point

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:13.250
of fantasy. G. K. Chesterton said that the
function of the imagination is not

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.170
to make strange things settle,
so much as to make

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:20.880
settled things strange.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.940
And as always,

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.280
thanks for watching.
