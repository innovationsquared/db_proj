Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And today we're going to talk about

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.310
yawning.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.150
Why do we yawn and why is yawning contagious?

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.790
How come when I see someone yawn or even
think about it it makes me

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.940
kinda of want to yawn?
First things first, definitions.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.110
When you yawn, you inhale air and

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.800
stretch your ear drums.
That's why your ears pop when you yawn.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.520
Now, if you yawn and at the same time
stretch your whole body,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.190
that is called pandiculation.
A common misconception about

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.450
yawning is that people yawn
when they need more air,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.660
more oxygen.
But studies have shown that no matter how much

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.820
oxygen is in the air around a person,
they won't yawn more or less frequently.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.220
And when people exercise
and their bodies do, in fact,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.300
need more oxygen, they don't yawn more often.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.980
Instead, research has shown that our
first answer most likely lies

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.530
in being cool.
When you are

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.130
exhausted, tired, deep brain

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.159
temperatures increase, but your brain is
like a computer - it operates best

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.670
at a very specific temperature.
And so yawning,

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.100
bringing all this outside air in through
your ears and your mouth,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.710
cools your facial blood and actually
helps cool down

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.869
your brain.
This phenomenon is particularly easy to observe

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.679
when parakeets yawn. Researchers have
found that parakeets only yawn within a

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:35.850
very specific range of temperatures.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.039
Too cold outside and yawning will cool
the brain too much.

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:44.009
Too hot and yawning will actually warm
it up. Parakeets are perfect test

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.299
subjects for this effect,

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.579
because they yawn just like you and me,
except they don't exhibit

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.189
contagious yawn.
If you show a person a video of other people

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.429
yawning, it's likely that the person
watching will yawn

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.749
his or herself, unless you put an

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:04.530
ice pack on their forehead, keeping their brain cooler.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.970
Seriously. The University of Albany has
found that people contagiously yawn

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.810
less frequently when they have
ice packs on their head,

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.910
which means that yawning to cool your brain

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.580
isn't just for the birds.
Studies have shown that

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.290
yawning also increases blood pressure, stretches

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.780
facial muscles and increases focus.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.959
When you panticulate, you stretch

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.379
all of your muscles, making them better
ready to be used

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:37.489
at any moment.
So when it comes to a herd of prey animals,

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.099
contagious yawning make sense,
because a herd that

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.329
yawns together stays alert together.

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.200
Under this theory, yawning is advantageously

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.439
contagious, because that first
animal to yawn

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:55.269
acts as a sort of reminder to the rest
of the herd to keep themselves

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.319
ready and alert. But, of course, when we say that yawning is contagious, we don't mean

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.709
like

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.349
a disease.
Instead, it's a bit more closely related

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.869
to empathy.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.560
Sympathy is when you are
concerned for others, where you wish

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.469
someone was better off.
Empathy is the ability to

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:18.860
recognize and share the emotions that other people

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.489
feel. 
Emotional contagion is when

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.900
the emotions of people around you
influence the way you feel

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.239
without you even having to separate
yourselves from them, like when

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.319
being around happy people lifts your spirits or how

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.269
anger and fear can lead to mob mentality.
Now,

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.260
children with autism, who exhibit
impaired social interaction and

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.439
communication,

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:44.500
yawn less frequently than other children

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.900
when viewing videos of people yawning.
So,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.379
is yawning an emotional contagion or is it about

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:54.469
empathy?
Well last year, the University of Pisa

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:57.709
found that yawn contagiousness is greatest with

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.709
family and then friends and then

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.109
acquaintances and lastly strangers.

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.870
And a study at Leeds University brought
in participants to take a test that

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.650
measured how

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.859
empathetic they were.
But before the test began,

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:16.850
amongst them was one person
who worked for the researchers

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.170
and this person yawned
every minute for 10 minutes.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.800
Interestingly, the people who wound up
scoring the highest

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.360
on the empathy test were also the ones
who contagiously yawned along

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.900
the most.
Let's talk more about animal

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.830
yawning. What fascinates me so much is that
animals across many species

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.940
all yawn, but they do so for different reasons.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.100
Animals like guinea pigs and some monkeys yawn

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.650
to intimidate and show their sharp scary teeth.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.610
Some penguins yawn to attract mates 
and when snakes yawn,

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.560
it seems to be about realigning their
jaws and opening their tracheas

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.590
to breathe better after a big body
disfiguring

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.400
meal.
Fish yawn more frequently when water

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.900
oxygen levels are low or water heat levels

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.660
are high. So, when you yawn you're
participating in the behavior shared

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.340
across all kinds of animals,

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.949
but most likely you're yawning for
purposes unique to your species -

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.469
us humans.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.720
What's really cool is that

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.349
yawning is most likely an ancient signal
telling the rest of us humans

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.589
"let's do this, let's survive."

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:37.389
And as always,

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:38.449
thanks for watching.
