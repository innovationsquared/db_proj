00:00:00.030,00:00:03.440,"By the end of this video, one of these three high school seniors",2019-04-19
00:00:03.440,00:00:08.720,will be awarded two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for their original scientific research,2019-04-19
00:00:08.720,00:00:12.080,"now the way this went down was, Regeneron the sponsor of this video,",2019-04-19
00:00:12.080,00:00:17.280,invited me out to Washington DC for the awards gala of the Regeneron Science Talent Search,2019-04-19
00:00:17.280,00:00:22.400,this is the nation's oldest and most prestigious science and math competition for high school seniors,2019-04-19
00:00:22.400,00:00:25.560,founded and produced by Society for Science &amp; the Public,2019-04-19
00:00:25.560,00:00:29.680,Here the 40 finalists were honored and the top 10 winners announced,2019-04-19
00:00:29.680,00:00:34.560,now they couldn't tell me who was going to win because not even they knew beforehand,2019-04-19
00:00:34.560,00:00:40.120,and that's because the students are judged not only on the strength of their projects but also on interviews,2019-04-19
00:00:40.120,00:00:45.320,where they are asked very challenging questions about a wide range of scientific topics,2019-04-19
00:00:45.320,00:00:49.520,so I selected three students to follow and find out more about their projects,2019-04-19
00:00:49.520,00:00:55.120,just to be clear these were not the top three place winners they are students I picked in advance,2019-04-19
00:00:55.120,00:00:58.720,but it just so happened that I picked the winner,2019-04-19
00:00:58.720,00:01:00.600,so can you pick the winner?,2019-04-19
00:01:00.600,00:01:02.480,let's meet the candidates,2019-04-19
00:01:02.480,00:01:05.640,Ronak Roy redesigned the Phoroptor,2019-04-19
00:01:05.640,00:01:09.040,that's the device used to determine eyeglass prescriptions,2019-04-19
00:01:09.040,00:01:14.880,"it contains dozens of precision glass lenses making it bulky, heavy, expensive",2019-04-19
00:01:14.880,00:01:17.960,and a design that hasn't really changed in two hundred years,2019-04-19
00:01:17.960,00:01:23.280,I wanted to make something that you know could could fit the greater than half the Earth's population,2019-04-19
00:01:23.280,00:01:28.600,who you know can't just you know drive down to an optometrist office and just get a prescription,2019-04-19
00:01:28.600,00:01:30.000,so can we see it?,2019-04-19
00:01:30.000,00:01:31.440,oh yeah absolutely,2019-04-19
00:01:31.440,00:01:34.040,so this is this is my child here,2019-04-19
00:01:34.040,00:01:37.920,this is this is the portable Phoroptor,2019-04-19
00:01:37.920,00:01:40.720,as you can see it has the the liquid lens,2019-04-19
00:01:40.720,00:01:47.280,that is actually the one responsible for replacing the dozens of precisely machine lenses here,2019-04-19
00:01:47.280,00:01:49.360,so how does this liquid lens work,2019-04-19
00:01:49.360,00:01:53.720,Right. So it has a droplet of a polar substance like water,2019-04-19
00:01:53.720,00:01:57.520,And a droplet of a non-polar substance like like a mineral oil,2019-04-19
00:01:57.520,00:01:59.720,when you apply a voltage across of it,2019-04-19
00:01:59.720,00:02:03.480,the voltage will cause the polar substance to actually change its shape,2019-04-19
00:02:03.480,00:02:07.000,and go hug or repel the surfaces of the lens,2019-04-19
00:02:07.000,00:02:10.680,so by changing the shape of the bubble you change the way light refracts through it,2019-04-19
00:02:10.680,00:02:13.080,as it passes through that the two glass windows,2019-04-19
00:02:13.080,00:02:16.000,and therefore you know you're changing the focal length of the lens,2019-04-19
00:02:16.000,00:02:17.360,you you made an app?,2019-04-19
00:02:17.360,00:02:18.120,yeah I did,2019-04-19
00:02:18.120,00:02:22.320,so the screen you're looking at which is runs on an app on my smartphone,2019-04-19
00:02:22.320,00:02:26.320,displays a test chart and runs an algorithm to actually do the refraction,2019-04-19
00:02:26.320,00:02:27.960,I mean those are pretty small letters,2019-04-19
00:02:27.960,00:02:32.520,those three static glass lenses are able to make it so the light coming from the phone,2019-04-19
00:02:32.520,00:02:35.880,are projected to a virtual distance of that twenty feet,2019-04-19
00:02:35.880,00:02:41.600,so it's basically simulating that that test room but you know optically instead,2019-04-19
00:02:41.600,00:02:45.800,so the way it works is there's an algorithm running on the smartphone app,2019-04-19
00:02:45.800,00:02:49.800,that generates pairs of lens voltages for the patient to compare,2019-04-19
00:02:49.800,00:02:54.920,and in order to switch between the two lens voltages the patient can click a button on a pair of headphones,2019-04-19
00:02:54.920,00:02:57.720,so you can click once to toggle between the two,2019-04-19
00:02:57.720,00:03:01.240,and once you've found which of the two is the best,2019-04-19
00:03:01.240,00:03:02.240,okay that's better,2019-04-19
00:03:02.240,00:03:03.960,all right so you can double click it,2019-04-19
00:03:03.960,00:03:09.200,and it will you know indicate to the algorithm that it indeed is the best and generate the next pair,2019-04-19
00:03:09.200,00:03:10.640,yeah I think it got worse,2019-04-19
00:03:10.640,00:03:11.960,yeah um so...,2019-04-19
00:03:11.960,00:03:12.800,And I'm gonna click?,2019-04-19
00:03:12.800,00:03:13.640,Uh.. Yeah,2019-04-19
00:03:13.640,00:03:16.400,Okay that's better but it's not the best I've seen,2019-04-19
00:03:16.400,00:03:21.520,the algorithm will basically cycle through this lens voltage pair generation process,2019-04-19
00:03:21.520,00:03:24.800,"this is like night and day. Like, it's not like it's not even a question",2019-04-19
00:03:24.800,00:03:28.560,until it zeros in on on the one voltage that works the best for you,2019-04-19
00:03:28.560,00:03:33.240,okay okay that or... Oh yes,2019-04-19
00:03:33.240,00:03:34.080,Test complete,2019-04-19
00:03:34.080,00:03:36.160,all right awesome would you like to know,2019-04-19
00:03:36.160,00:03:38.240,I would love to know what my eyesight is like,2019-04-19
00:03:38.240,00:03:42.600,all right so I calculated negative 1.25 diopters,2019-04-19
00:03:42.600,00:03:47.480,um which is roughly in the range that most people with slight nearsightedness would have,2019-04-19
00:03:48.520,00:03:52.480,Ana Humphrey wanted to find hidden exoplanets with math,2019-04-19
00:03:52.480,00:03:57.240,the Kepler space telescope has been the most prolific planet finder to date,2019-04-19
00:03:57.240,00:04:03.400,"detecting over 2,000 exoplanets by measuring a dip in their host stars brightness when they pass in front of it",2019-04-19
00:04:03.400,00:04:08.320,but what happens if the planet passes just above or just below the star,2019-04-19
00:04:08.320,00:04:11.040,"Also, what if that planet is really small?",2019-04-19
00:04:11.040,00:04:15.120,those little tiny shadows are really hard to pull out and you've got a lot of noise,2019-04-19
00:04:15.120,00:04:19.040,a further challenge is that the Kepler mission only ran for four years,2019-04-19
00:04:19.040,00:04:24.320,that means our absolute limit is it's really hard to find anything that takes longer than four years to orbit,2019-04-19
00:04:24.320,00:04:26.520,"To identify planets Kepler might have missed,",2019-04-19
00:04:26.520,00:04:29.400,Ana looked at existing multi planetary systems,2019-04-19
00:04:29.400,00:04:33.800,and calculated whether additional planets could fit in between the ones we observed,2019-04-19
00:04:33.800,00:04:35.800,without disturbing their orbits,2019-04-19
00:04:35.800,00:04:40.760,I imagine that you already have some sort of planets here,2019-04-19
00:04:40.760,00:04:42.840,so we're going to call this planet X,2019-04-19
00:04:42.840,00:04:44.360,so what are these two lines?,2019-04-19
00:04:44.360,00:04:47.400,this line here is the same as this outer line,2019-04-19
00:04:47.400,00:04:52.040,it's how close your imaginary planet can get to your outer planet,2019-04-19
00:04:52.040,00:04:56.240,and this line here is your a-x-min,2019-04-19
00:04:56.240,00:05:01.600,so it's how close your imaginary planet can get to your inner planet so it's this line here,2019-04-19
00:05:01.600,00:05:07.120,we have this region of stability given the extremes of where we can put a planet,2019-04-19
00:05:07.120,00:05:10.560,and we have the maximum mass you can fit there,2019-04-19
00:05:10.560,00:05:14.160,and anything in this area here,2019-04-19
00:05:14.160,00:05:16.040,sort of shade around our label,2019-04-19
00:05:16.040,00:05:18.600,anything between these two graphs,2019-04-19
00:05:18.600,00:05:22.760,is a combination of a planet's mass and a location of the planet,2019-04-19
00:05:22.760,00:05:26.720,that we could fit in between the two we know about and maintain a stable system,2019-04-19
00:05:26.720,00:05:27.600,cool,2019-04-19
00:05:27.600,00:05:28.400,yeah,2019-04-19
00:05:28.400,00:05:34.200,Now the question everyone will ask you is like what's to say that this planet really exists,2019-04-19
00:05:34.200,00:05:36.040,as opposed to you just making up stuff?,2019-04-19
00:05:36.040,00:05:38.480,So the assumption that I made going into my research,2019-04-19
00:05:38.480,00:05:43.640,was that systems are going to try to have as many planets packed in as possible,2019-04-19
00:05:43.640,00:05:46.360,this is called the packed planetary system hypothesis,2019-04-19
00:05:46.360,00:05:50.280,there are 560 locations where we could fit additional planets,2019-04-19
00:05:50.280,00:05:52.400,so quite a few,2019-04-19
00:05:52.400,00:05:54.680,how might we go about actually finding them?,2019-04-19
00:05:54.680,00:05:59.720,One of the ways you could go about doing this is by doing something called folding the data,2019-04-19
00:05:59.720,00:06:04.480,so let's say we figure out that a planet should have an orbital period of about one month,2019-04-19
00:06:05.160,00:06:10.400,we have a year's worth of data and we fold that data in twelve and get it to line up just right,2019-04-19
00:06:10.400,00:06:14.440,we can get it so those transit signals actually layer on top of each other,2019-04-19
00:06:14.440,00:06:19.320,and then we get a larger signal as a that you know we can find,2019-04-19
00:06:19.320,00:06:22.920,as opposed to the really small signals that sort of get lost in the noise,2019-04-19
00:06:22.920,00:06:25.360,"Do you want to introduce yourself? What's your name, what do you do?",2019-04-19
00:06:24.040,00:06:24.560,Sure,2019-04-19
00:06:25.360,00:06:27.680,Yeah. My name is Anjali Chadha.,2019-04-19
00:06:27.680,00:06:31.600,"I am a senior at DuPont Manual High School in Louisville, Kentucky",2019-04-19
00:06:31.600,00:06:33.840,What is.. this?,2019-04-19
00:06:33.840,00:06:34.840,That,2019-04-19
00:06:35.800,00:06:39.960,Anjali was concerned with dangerous contaminants in drinking water,2019-04-19
00:06:39.960,00:06:42.440,this is a prototype of my arsenic sensor,2019-04-19
00:06:42.440,00:06:46.760,so you want to load a water sample right here in this compartment,2019-04-19
00:06:46.760,00:06:49.840,the whole process starts with an automated chemical reaction,2019-04-19
00:06:49.840,00:06:54.760,so there are a bunch of chemical reagents that sit in this compartment above the water sample,2019-04-19
00:06:54.760,00:06:57.160,so the first reagent is tartaric acid,2019-04-19
00:06:57.160,00:07:01.080,next is a combination of salts it's called mono potassium sulfate,2019-04-19
00:07:01.080,00:07:03.040,and the third is zinc,2019-04-19
00:07:03.040,00:07:07.560,Arsenic is an element that's never found freely but it's always bound to other elements,2019-04-19
00:07:07.560,00:07:12.200,so basically that chemical reaction will help to free up all of the arsenic,2019-04-19
00:07:12.200,00:07:17.280,and then the arsenic content changes into a gaseous form of arsine gas,2019-04-19
00:07:17.280,00:07:20.800,and that's the best detectable form of arsenic basically,2019-04-19
00:07:20.800,00:07:23.840,so what happens after that gas is formed,2019-04-19
00:07:23.840,00:07:27.480,is that there is a test strip and it's covered in mercury bromide,2019-04-19
00:07:27.480,00:07:31.720,which oxidizes in response to the arsenic and then changes color,2019-04-19
00:07:31.720,00:07:33.880,So it's actually on a gradient scale.,2019-04-19
00:07:33.880,00:07:37.400,If there's very little arsenic content then it just changes to a light color,2019-04-19
00:07:37.400,00:07:40.480,and if there's a lot changes a dark color and everything in between,2019-04-19
00:07:40.480,00:07:44.560,right so what I then did was write an image processing algorithm,2019-04-19
00:07:44.560,00:07:47.840,using some embedded electronic devices,2019-04-19
00:07:47.840,00:07:52.920,specifically this device called an ArduCAM it's just an embedded camera,2019-04-19
00:07:52.920,00:07:58.200,and essentially the camera takes a picture of that test strip after it's changed color,2019-04-19
00:07:58.200,00:08:02.560,it then pulls out all of the color values of the test strip,2019-04-19
00:08:02.560,00:08:05.200,and converts them into concentration data,2019-04-19
00:08:05.200,00:08:09.120,so I wrote some mathematical models that kind of made that conversion,2019-04-19
00:08:09.120,00:08:13.280,and then the last kind of piece of the puzzle is that there is this device,2019-04-19
00:08:13.280,00:08:15.680,it's a microcontroller called a particle electron,2019-04-19
00:08:15.680,00:08:17.960,and it's connected to this cellular antenna,2019-04-19
00:08:17.960,00:08:21.040,so that the data is instantaneously transmitted to the cloud,2019-04-19
00:08:21.040,00:08:23.200,the real advantages of that is that,2019-04-19
00:08:23.200,00:08:27.040,several people would be able to access the data collected from one sensor,2019-04-19
00:08:27.040,00:08:28.960,whether it's people in the same community,2019-04-19
00:08:28.960,00:08:32.880,who want to kind of have that information and knowledge about their water sources,2019-04-19
00:08:32.880,00:08:37.440,or whether it's people in research organizations who are trying to really learn more,2019-04-19
00:08:37.440,00:08:41.120,learn what to test learn what to improve and what sites to really work on,2019-04-19
00:08:41.120,00:08:44.840,so those are kind of the reasons why I chose to do that,2019-04-19
00:08:44.840,00:08:46.840,So now the moment of truth,2019-04-19
00:08:46.840,00:08:51.960,which one of these high school students will win two hundred and fifty thousand dollars?,2019-04-19
00:08:51.960,00:08:56.200,"now I should point out that all 40 finalists each receive at least $25,000,",2019-04-19
00:08:56.200,00:08:58.120,the top ten receiving more than that,2019-04-19
00:08:59.080,00:09:06.440,the first-place winner and recipient of a 250 thousand dollar award...,2019-04-19
