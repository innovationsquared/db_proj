00:02:36.740,00:02:38.710,- Now what we'll do is we'll actually give his venom glands,2022-03-22
00:02:38.710,00:02:39.543,a little bit of a massage.,2022-03-22
00:02:39.543,00:02:41.470,"So what you would consider his cheeks,",2022-03-22

00:03:11.950,00:03:13.680,So how much venom do you actually need,2022-03-22
00:03:13.680,00:03:15.180,to make antivenom?,2022-03-22
00:03:15.180,00:03:16.380,- [Zac] About 15.,2022-03-22
00:03:16.380,00:03:18.509,- [Derek] 15 snakes to make one vial of antivenom?,2022-03-22
00:03:18.509,00:03:20.090,- Yeah.,2022-03-22
00:03:20.090,00:03:22.050,- [Derek] Venom evolved from saliva,2022-03-22
00:03:22.050,00:03:25.690,and it's used primarily for catching and digesting prey.,2022-03-22
00:03:25.690,00:03:28.370,Each species of snake has a different venom,2022-03-22
00:03:28.370,00:03:31.780,tailored to the specific animals they hunt.,2022-03-22
00:03:31.780,00:03:33.750,The venom was originally squirted,2022-03-22
00:03:33.750,00:03:36.370,"into a snake's mouth by the back teeth,",2022-03-22
00:03:36.370,00:03:37.310,"and to this day,",2022-03-22
00:03:37.310,00:03:40.800,almost 2/3 of all snakes are rear fanged.,2022-03-22
00:03:40.800,00:03:42.960,"- Now why the rear tooth, you might ask?",2022-03-22
00:03:42.960,00:03:45.430,"Well, it's because the venom gland itself",2022-03-22
00:03:45.430,00:03:47.720,is actually behind the snake's eye.,2022-03-22
00:03:47.720,00:03:50.320,So the shortest distance for a duct,2022-03-22
00:03:50.320,00:03:55.120,is directly downwards to the back end of the top jaw.,2022-03-22
00:03:55.120,00:03:56.300,"- [Derek] In some species,",2022-03-22
00:03:56.300,00:03:59.230,evolutionary pressures caused the fangs to move closer,2022-03-22
00:03:59.230,00:04:01.280,"and closer to the front of the jaw,",2022-03-22
00:04:01.280,00:04:05.040,improving the snake's ability to catch and kill prey.,2022-03-22
00:04:05.040,00:04:07.600,"While the location of the fangs was evolving,",2022-03-22
00:04:07.600,00:04:09.670,so were the fangs themselves.,2022-03-22
00:04:09.670,00:04:12.320,They started off as smooth ordinary teeth,2022-03-22
00:04:12.320,00:04:15.030,"with venom flowing down the outside,",2022-03-22
00:04:15.030,00:04:16.210,"but over time,",2022-03-22
00:04:16.210,00:04:19.560,some snake lineages evolved a groove in each fang,2022-03-22
00:04:19.560,00:04:21.710,to channel the flow of venom.,2022-03-22
00:04:21.710,00:04:24.940,"In some species, the groove became deeper and deeper",2022-03-22
00:04:24.940,00:04:28.130,"eventually closing in to form a hollow tube,",2022-03-22
00:04:28.130,00:04:32.370,and now the teeth literally inject venom into prey.,2022-03-22
00:04:32.370,00:04:33.920,But this is not the norm.,2022-03-22
00:04:33.920,00:04:37.650,"Only 1/7 of the world's snakes have hollow fangs,",2022-03-22
00:04:37.650,00:04:40.660,"but, of course, almost all the venomous snakes in Australia",2022-03-22
00:04:40.660,00:04:42.340,"do have hollow fangs,",2022-03-22
00:04:42.340,00:04:45.420,so we set up this macro shot to take a closer look.,2022-03-22
00:04:45.420,00:04:46.720,- This one's rolling.,2022-03-22

00:05:00.920,00:05:03.080,It's got like jets,2022-03-22
00:05:03.080,00:05:04.980,Jets of venom coming out.,2022-03-22
00:05:04.980,00:05:06.700,Has this guy not been milked in a while or?,2022-03-22

00:05:18.470,00:05:19.790,They're bred to produce more venom,2022-03-22

00:05:20.980,00:05:23.880,"So some of our coastal taipans are producing five, six",2022-03-22
00:05:23.880,00:05:26.380,"nearly seven times what their wild counterpart would,",2022-03-22
00:05:26.380,00:05:27.650,and that's just from selective breeding.,2022-03-22

00:05:34.430,00:05:35.450,- That sounds horrendous.,2022-03-22
00:05:35.450,00:05:36.610,So you're saying that,2022-03-22
00:05:36.610,00:05:38.840,"these are the most venomous snakes in the world,",2022-03-22
00:05:38.840,00:05:41.880,and then you have bred them to be more venomous?,2022-03-22
00:05:41.880,00:05:43.987,"- Yeah, they're super snakes.",2022-03-22
00:05:44.890,00:05:47.120,A scratch from any of these animals could kill you.,2022-03-22
00:05:47.120,00:05:49.630,"And some of these snakes are giving 4.5,",2022-03-22
00:05:49.630,00:05:51.630,"4.9 grams of venom per bite,",2022-03-22
00:05:51.630,00:05:53.660,which is just stupid amounts.,2022-03-22
00:05:53.660,00:05:55.910,"- We spoke to venom expert, Timothy Jackson",2022-03-22
00:05:55.910,00:05:58.300,who argued these snakes produce more venom,2022-03-22
00:05:58.300,00:06:01.910,"because they are regularly milked, unlike wild snakes.",2022-03-22
00:06:01.910,00:06:05.370,"Either way, the snakes in this room contain more venom",2022-03-22
00:06:05.370,00:06:08.150,than virtually any others on earth.,2022-03-22
00:06:08.150,00:06:10.750,"- We house the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth,",2022-03-22
00:06:10.750,00:06:12.440,"and about the 12th or 13th most toxic,",2022-03-22
00:06:12.440,00:06:14.690,depending on who you talk to.,2022-03-22
00:06:14.690,00:06:16.410,- [Derek] One bite from a King Cobra,2022-03-22
00:06:16.410,00:06:19.940,"contains enough venom to kill 13,000 mice,",2022-03-22
00:06:19.940,00:06:23.040,and we know this because of a study from 1979,2022-03-22
00:06:23.040,00:06:26.180,that tested the venoms of 25 different species of snake,2022-03-22
00:06:26.180,00:06:27.790,on lab mice.,2022-03-22
00:06:27.790,00:06:29.170,"From this, we can estimate",2022-03-22
00:06:29.170,00:06:31.090,that the venom from one King Cobra bite,2022-03-22
00:06:31.090,00:06:33.700,"could kill around four humans,",2022-03-22
00:06:33.700,00:06:34.980,"though to be precise,",2022-03-22
00:06:34.980,00:06:37.830,we'd have to say four human-sized rodents,2022-03-22
00:06:37.830,00:06:41.650,"because thankfully, no one's tested these venoms on humans.",2022-03-22
00:06:41.650,00:06:42.930,"And by this measure,",2022-03-22
00:06:42.930,00:06:46.750,"the most venomous snake in the world is the inland taipan,",2022-03-22
00:06:46.750,00:06:50.620,which conveniently lives in the middle of Australia.,2022-03-22
00:06:50.620,00:06:52.160,A bite from the inland taipan,2022-03-22
00:06:52.160,00:06:55.520,"has enough venom to kill half a million mice,",2022-03-22
00:06:55.520,00:06:57.910,or more than 100 humans.,2022-03-22
00:06:57.910,00:07:01.330,"So yeah, why not milk that one next?",2022-03-22
00:07:01.330,00:07:03.340,"- So the next one, we're gonna step it up another notch.",2022-03-22
00:07:03.340,00:07:05.130,"So this is the inland taipan,",2022-03-22
00:07:05.130,00:07:06.510,"also known as the fierce snake,",2022-03-22
00:07:06.510,00:07:08.890,the most toxic land snake on the planet.,2022-03-22
00:07:08.890,00:07:11.320,These guys have the ability with one drop of venom,2022-03-22
00:07:11.320,00:07:13.350,to knock over 100 adult humans.,2022-03-22
00:07:13.350,00:07:15.490,So stupidly toxic.,2022-03-22
00:07:15.490,00:07:16.720,So quite a lot smaller,2022-03-22
00:07:16.720,00:07:18.240,"than the last couple of animals we've used,",2022-03-22
00:07:18.240,00:07:20.130,but makes up for it in toxicity.,2022-03-22
00:07:20.130,00:07:23.090,"Very, very quick and very naughty when he wants to be,",2022-03-22
00:07:23.090,00:07:24.840,but an absolutely gorgeous pattern.,2022-03-22
00:07:26.080,00:07:27.180,"You can grab that bit for me, mate.",2022-03-22
00:07:27.180,00:07:28.013,- Yes.,2022-03-22
00:07:28.013,00:07:29.797,- I'm gonna grab this vial from behind you.,2022-03-22
00:07:30.690,00:07:31.523,"And as you can see,",2022-03-22
00:07:31.523,00:07:32.820,he's very keen on the killing.,2022-03-22
00:07:36.090,00:07:36.923,There we go.,2022-03-22
00:07:36.923,00:07:38.770,- [Derek] That is extraordinary.,2022-03-22
00:07:38.770,00:07:41.283,The most venomous snake in the world.,2022-03-22
00:07:43.810,00:07:46.311,"- Just incredible animals, aren't they?",2022-03-22
00:07:46.311,00:07:48.922,(cage door shuts),2022-03-22
00:07:48.922,00:07:49.947,(laughs),2022-03-22
00:07:49.947,00:07:50.780,- [Derek] That was quick.,2022-03-22
00:07:50.780,00:07:52.130,"- Yeah, those ones make me proper nervous.",2022-03-22
00:07:52.130,00:07:52.963,"I don't know about you guys,",2022-03-22
00:07:52.963,00:07:53.796,but I'm sweating.,2022-03-22
00:07:53.796,00:07:55.400,- [Derek] Can you see the hands?,2022-03-22
00:07:55.400,00:07:57.390,- The moment I stop doing that after a milking,2022-03-22
00:07:57.390,00:07:59.111,is the day I quit.,2022-03-22
00:08:00.240,00:08:02.250,- [Derek] The concept of the most venomous snake,2022-03-22
00:08:02.250,00:08:03.520,is complicated,2022-03-22
00:08:03.520,00:08:06.120,because snakes evolved their venom specifically,2022-03-22
00:08:06.120,00:08:08.570,"for potency against their usual prey,",2022-03-22
00:08:08.570,00:08:11.890,"in turn, their prey evolved resistance to their venom.",2022-03-22
00:08:11.890,00:08:13.780,"The honey badger, for example,",2022-03-22
00:08:13.780,00:08:16.850,is almost completely immune to Cobra venom.,2022-03-22
00:08:16.850,00:08:20.260,"So the lethality of a bite depends on the snake,",2022-03-22
00:08:20.260,00:08:22.130,"the animal that got bitten,",2022-03-22
00:08:22.130,00:08:24.590,and the amount of venom injected.,2022-03-22
00:08:24.590,00:08:27.820,The reason scientists test different venoms on lab mice,2022-03-22
00:08:27.820,00:08:30.630,is to get an estimate of the amount of antivenom,2022-03-22
00:08:30.630,00:08:33.350,that would be required to neutralize a bite.,2022-03-22
00:08:33.350,00:08:35.370,Snake venom is lethal to us,2022-03-22
00:08:35.370,00:08:38.560,"because we are closely related to snakes' main prey,",2022-03-22
00:08:38.560,00:08:39.590,rodents.,2022-03-22
00:08:39.590,00:08:42.590,Rodents and primates split on the evolutionary tree,2022-03-22

00:08:45.000,00:08:47.430,"so we share a lot of the same biology,",2022-03-22
00:08:47.430,00:08:50.710,"from the structure of our cells to the way our blood clots,",2022-03-22
00:08:50.710,00:08:53.240,to how our nerves send signals.,2022-03-22
00:08:53.240,00:08:58.100,- Venoms typically target very conserved molecular pathways,2022-03-22
00:08:58.100,00:09:00.740,that exist across maybe all vertebrates,2022-03-22
00:09:00.740,00:09:05.113,or maybe even the entire tree of life in some cases.,2022-03-22
00:09:07.240,00:09:08.460,- [Derek] There are four ways,2022-03-22
00:09:08.460,00:09:10.130,that snake venom can kill you.,2022-03-22
00:09:10.130,00:09:11.840,"It can be neurotoxic,",2022-03-22
00:09:11.840,00:09:14.180,damaging to your nervous system and brain,2022-03-22
00:09:14.180,00:09:16.380,"by interfering with neurotransmitters,",2022-03-22
00:09:16.380,00:09:19.250,the signaling chemicals that go between neurons.,2022-03-22
00:09:19.250,00:09:21.098,"It can be hemotoxic,",2022-03-22
00:09:21.098,00:09:21.931,"thinning out your blood,",2022-03-22

00:09:23.770,00:09:25.830,and causing internal bleeding.,2022-03-22
00:09:25.830,00:09:28.280,It does this by disturbing the delicate machinery,2022-03-22
00:09:28.280,00:09:30.480,of the blood coagulation system.,2022-03-22
00:09:30.480,00:09:32.710,"Venom can also be cytotoxic,",2022-03-22

00:09:39.760,00:09:43.080,destroying muscles and causing paralysis.,2022-03-22
00:09:43.080,00:09:45.050,The worst part is that snake venoms,2022-03-22
00:09:45.050,00:09:47.680,can contain up to 200 compounds.,2022-03-22
00:09:47.680,00:09:50.450,"Most venoms contain a combination of neurotoxic,",2022-03-22

00:10:07.191,00:10:08.024,Good boy.,2022-03-22

00:10:11.470,00:10:14.220,I've been at the park for 10 years this year.,2022-03-22

00:10:18.160,00:10:19.560,- Have you ever been bitten?,2022-03-22
00:10:21.940,00:10:25.523,"- Yeah, so about 3 1/2 years ago, I got a scratch.",2022-03-22
00:10:27.620,00:10:29.000,One finger got nicked.,2022-03-22
00:10:29.000,00:10:31.040,That was 36 hours in ICU,2022-03-22
00:10:31.040,00:10:33.280,and eight of those were on a resus bay.,2022-03-22
00:10:33.280,00:10:34.785,"So very, very serious.",2022-03-22
00:10:34.785,00:10:36.323,- [Derek] And what was that experience like?,2022-03-22
00:10:36.323,00:10:37.200,- That was crappy.,2022-03-22
00:10:37.200,00:10:38.033,"As it turns out,",2022-03-22
00:10:38.033,00:10:40.060,"I'm highly allergic to antivenom, which is not ideal.",2022-03-22
00:10:40.060,00:10:42.380,I started swelling up looking like the Elephant Man.,2022-03-22
00:10:42.380,00:10:44.060,So then they whack you with adrenaline,2022-03-22
00:10:44.060,00:10:45.420,to cancel out the anaphylaxis,2022-03-22
00:10:45.420,00:10:47.210,"and then they have to give you more anti-venom,",2022-03-22

00:10:52.095,00:10:53.370,"but it was like the best case scenario,",2022-03-22
00:10:53.370,00:10:54.610,"he didn't chew, he didn't bite,",2022-03-22
00:10:54.610,00:10:56.540,but literally just a scratch.,2022-03-22
00:10:56.540,00:10:58.610,- [Derek] So what is antivenom exactly?,2022-03-22
00:10:58.610,00:11:00.483,and how was it invented?,2022-03-22
00:11:01.390,00:11:04.840,"In 1870, a British military doctor, Edward Nicholson",2022-03-22

00:11:06.780,00:11:09.360,"and as he watched the local snake handlers,",2022-03-22
00:11:09.360,00:11:11.520,he noticed something strange.,2022-03-22
00:11:11.520,00:11:13.660,They would from time to time,2022-03-22
00:11:13.660,00:11:16.360,deliberately get Cobras to bite them,2022-03-22
00:11:16.360,00:11:19.200,in what he considered a form of tattooing.,2022-03-22
00:11:19.200,00:11:21.480,Nicholson reasoned that they were intentionally,2022-03-22
00:11:21.480,00:11:23.400,exposing their bodies to the venom,2022-03-22
00:11:23.400,00:11:25.990,to develop an immune response.,2022-03-22
00:11:25.990,00:11:28.520,He observed that the older snake handlers,2022-03-22
00:11:28.520,00:11:30.420,were less affected by accidental bites,2022-03-22
00:11:30.420,00:11:31.670,than the younger ones.,2022-03-22
00:11:31.670,00:11:35.533,So this dangerous practice seemed to be paying off.,2022-03-22
00:11:37.320,00:11:39.060,"20 years later in Saigon,",2022-03-22

00:11:49.930,00:11:52.670,to make a vaccine for snake bites.,2022-03-22
00:11:52.670,00:11:55.160,"Back in Paris, he tried injecting rabbits",2022-03-22

00:12:19.010,00:12:21.760,The rabbits' immune systems had developed antibodies,2022-03-22
00:12:21.760,00:12:23.680,to neutralize the venom.,2022-03-22
00:12:23.680,00:12:26.300,So you can be vaccinated against snake bites,2022-03-22
00:12:26.300,00:12:28.570,"just as you can against disease,",2022-03-22
00:12:28.570,00:12:29.960,but who wants to be vaccinated,2022-03-22
00:12:29.960,00:12:32.280,against all different types of snakes,2022-03-22
00:12:32.280,00:12:34.070,just in case one bites you?,2022-03-22
00:12:34.070,00:12:35.810,"It would be better, Calmette reasoned,",2022-03-22
00:12:35.810,00:12:39.650,if you could administer antibodies after a bite.,2022-03-22
00:12:39.650,00:12:42.510,So he drew blood from a venom resistant rabbit,2022-03-22
00:12:42.510,00:12:45.920,"and isolated the serum which contains the antibodies,",2022-03-22
00:12:45.920,00:12:48.430,and then he injected it into another rabbit,2022-03-22
00:12:48.430,00:12:51.110,that had never been exposed to venom.,2022-03-22
00:12:51.110,00:12:53.010,When he subsequently injected it,2022-03-22
00:12:53.010,00:12:55.530,"with twice the lethal dose of Cobra venom,",2022-03-22
00:12:55.530,00:12:57.860,the rabbit was just fine.,2022-03-22
00:12:57.860,00:13:01.680,Immunity had been transferred from one rabbit to another.,2022-03-22
00:13:01.680,00:13:04.050,"This was the first antivenom,",2022-03-22
00:13:04.050,00:13:07.710,"or as the Frenchman, Calmette called it, antivenin,",2022-03-22
00:13:07.710,00:13:11.260,which is why my phone always makes that auto-correction.,2022-03-22
00:13:11.260,00:13:14.960,"To this day, antivenoms are made in much the same way.",2022-03-22
00:13:14.960,00:13:16.150,"At the Reptile Park,",2022-03-22
00:13:16.150,00:13:18.230,they collect and freeze the venom.,2022-03-22
00:13:18.230,00:13:19.710,It's sent off to be diluted,2022-03-22
00:13:19.710,00:13:24.000,"and injected into a donor animal, usually a horse.",2022-03-22
00:13:24.000,00:13:26.610,Horses are used because of their size.,2022-03-22
00:13:26.610,00:13:29.390,"After increasing the dose over a period of months,",2022-03-22
00:13:29.390,00:13:31.860,"the horse builds up immunity to the venom,",2022-03-22
00:13:31.860,00:13:33.580,and then it's blood is drawn,2022-03-22
00:13:33.580,00:13:35.620,and the antibodies are isolated.,2022-03-22
00:13:35.620,00:13:36.990,"Only the plasma is taken,",2022-03-22
00:13:36.990,00:13:39.860,the red blood cells are returned to the horse.,2022-03-22
00:13:39.860,00:13:44.670,Those horse antibodies are the life saving antivenom.,2022-03-22
00:13:44.670,00:13:47.700,"Antivenom works for the same reason venom works,",2022-03-22
00:13:47.700,00:13:49.830,because of our shared evolutionary history,2022-03-22
00:13:49.830,00:13:51.350,with other mammals.,2022-03-22
00:13:51.350,00:13:53.300,The antibodies produced by horses,2022-03-22
00:13:53.300,00:13:56.080,"are very similar to the ones produced by humans,",2022-03-22
00:13:56.080,00:13:58.910,so they bind to toxic compounds and neutralize them,2022-03-22
00:13:58.910,00:14:00.960,even in our bodies.,2022-03-22
00:14:00.960,00:14:04.200,But this way of making antivenom has downsides.,2022-03-22
00:14:04.200,00:14:06.310,"Collecting the venom is dangerous,",2022-03-22
00:14:06.310,00:14:08.430,"many donor animals are involved,",2022-03-22
00:14:08.430,00:14:12.070,and some people are allergic to antivenom.,2022-03-22
00:14:12.070,00:14:14.190,Scientists are now exploring the possibility,2022-03-22
00:14:14.190,00:14:17.960,of producing antivenom using genetically modified bacteria.,2022-03-22
00:14:17.960,00:14:20.410,They would produce the specific antibodies,2022-03-22
00:14:20.410,00:14:23.670,"needed to neutralize each toxin in a venom,",2022-03-22
00:14:23.670,00:14:27.670,"but for now, this is the way antivenom is made.",2022-03-22
00:14:27.670,00:14:28.503,How's your arm?,2022-03-22
00:14:28.503,00:14:29.336,"- Yeah, it's a bit sore.",2022-03-22
