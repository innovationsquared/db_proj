00:04:56.049,00:04:58.450,- But you have to look carefully.,2020-11-30
00:04:58.450,00:05:00.810,Asteroids are not very big.,2020-11-30
00:05:00.810,00:05:04.498,They range from meters up to kilometers in size.,2020-11-30

00:05:12.240,00:05:14.400,The Chelyabinsk meteor was only around,2020-11-30

00:05:22.311,00:05:26.661,They only reflect around 15% of the light that hits them.,2020-11-30
00:05:26.661,00:05:29.160,So our best chance to see them,2020-11-30
00:05:29.160,00:05:32.230,is when they're fully illuminated by the sun.,2020-11-30
00:05:32.230,00:05:34.190,And that's why over 85%,2020-11-30
00:05:34.190,00:05:36.760,of the near earth asteroids we've detected,2020-11-30
00:05:36.760,00:05:39.207,were found in the 45 degrees of sky,2020-11-30
00:05:39.207,00:05:41.896,directly opposite the sun.,2020-11-30
00:05:41.896,00:05:44.300,"This is called the opposition effect,",2020-11-30
00:05:44.300,00:05:47.430,and it means there are likely more near earth,2020-11-30
00:05:47.430,00:05:49.438,and potentially hazardous asteroids,2020-11-30
00:05:49.438,00:05:51.771,that haven't been detected yet.,2020-11-30
00:05:51.771,00:05:55.320,Any asteroid approaching from the direction of the sun,2020-11-30
00:05:55.320,00:05:58.140,just can't be seen.,2020-11-30
00:05:58.140,00:06:01.023,This is exactly what happened with Chelyabinsk.,2020-11-30
00:06:03.000,00:06:08.000,"So far, we have detected and cataloged a million asteroids,",2020-11-30

00:06:22.720,00:06:25.490,it's hard to tell if it will hit the earth.,2020-11-30
00:06:25.490,00:06:27.370,"- So if you just discover an object,",2020-11-30
00:06:27.370,00:06:29.470,"and you only have data from a few days,",2020-11-30
00:06:29.470,00:06:31.480,"then you can't really tell where it's gonna go,",2020-11-30
00:06:31.480,00:06:34.340,because you're tryna take this little arc of motion,2020-11-30

00:06:36.480,00:06:39.300,what you need is observations over years and years.,2020-11-30
00:06:39.300,00:06:42.606,"But even if you have perfect observations of an asteroid,",2020-11-30
00:06:42.606,00:06:45.040,there's kind of a fundamental limit,2020-11-30
00:06:45.040,00:06:47.262,to how far in the future you can predict.,2020-11-30
00:06:47.262,00:06:49.780,"And that's because of a couple of effects,",2020-11-30
00:06:49.780,00:06:51.010,"but one is that, you know,",2020-11-30
00:06:51.010,00:06:54.650,they're not just orbiting the sun with no other influence.,2020-11-30
00:06:54.650,00:06:56.490,"All of the planets have gravity,",2020-11-30
00:06:56.490,00:06:58.544,and all of the planets are pulling on,2020-11-30
00:06:58.544,00:07:02.940,near earth asteroids and can change the orbit significantly.,2020-11-30
00:07:02.940,00:07:05.850,"So there is something called dynamical chaos,",2020-11-30
00:07:05.850,00:07:08.590,"which basically means, after a certain amount of time,",2020-11-30
00:07:08.590,00:07:10.836,you don't know where the asteroid is gonna be.,2020-11-30
00:07:10.836,00:07:12.810,"And in practice, what that means is,",2020-11-30
00:07:12.810,00:07:17.350,we can't do any work more than 100 years in the future.,2020-11-30
00:07:17.350,00:07:20.817,So the maximum time you can predict with any accuracy at all,2020-11-30
00:07:20.817,00:07:23.673,where a body will be is about 100 years.,2020-11-30
00:07:23.673,00:07:26.250,"- And this is pretty important,",2020-11-30
00:07:26.250,00:07:28.043,"because we know with certainty,",2020-11-30

00:07:40.210,00:07:41.610,who was the first to suggest,2020-11-30
00:07:41.610,00:07:44.640,it was formed by a meteorite impact.,2020-11-30
00:07:44.640,00:07:47.149,"The prevailing view, even up until the 1950s,",2020-11-30
00:07:47.149,00:07:50.271,was that it was created by volcanic activity.,2020-11-30
00:07:50.271,00:07:53.830,But Barringer was convinced it was the site,2020-11-30
00:07:53.830,00:07:56.065,of an iron meteorite impact.,2020-11-30
00:07:56.065,00:07:59.860,"So in 1903, he staked a mining claim,",2020-11-30
00:07:59.860,00:08:02.919,"and began drilling for the metallic meteorite,",2020-11-30
00:08:02.919,00:08:05.750,which he believed to be worth more than,2020-11-30

00:08:09.453,00:08:10.670,"So people are motivated by money, right?",2020-11-30
00:08:10.670,00:08:11.503,"So they thought,",2020-11-30

00:08:13.330,00:08:16.360,So they started to drill in the bottom of the crater,2020-11-30

00:16:49.795,00:16:52.070,"We came down to the most basic idea, well,",2020-11-30
00:16:52.070,00:16:53.210,maybe if we could figure out,2020-11-30
00:16:53.210,00:16:54.650,"where the asteroid is gonna hit,",2020-11-30
00:16:54.650,00:16:57.170,"like which city is it gonna explode over,",2020-11-30
00:16:57.170,00:16:58.937,we can evacuate that city.,2020-11-30
00:16:58.937,00:17:01.785,"And then we looked at the history of city evacuations,",2020-11-30
00:17:01.785,00:17:04.055,"and we looked at cases, you know where,",2020-11-30
00:17:04.055,00:17:06.550,"for example, you have like a week's warning,",2020-11-30
00:17:06.550,00:17:09.135,where some hurricane system is gonna come in,2020-11-30
00:17:09.135,00:17:10.623,and flood a city.,2020-11-30
00:17:10.623,00:17:14.493,And evacuation just doesn't work either.,2020-11-30
00:17:14.493,00:17:16.430,"And the reason is very, very simple.",2020-11-30
00:17:16.430,00:17:19.810,"Going into a city, there are not that many freeways.",2020-11-30

00:17:25.960,00:17:28.120,"So instantly, you have millions of people",2020-11-30
00:17:28.120,00:17:30.370,"trying to get out of the target zone,",2020-11-30
00:17:30.370,00:17:32.649,and they won't be able to because all of the roads,2020-11-30

00:17:38.430,00:17:42.680,is probably the most hopeful thing that we could try to do.,2020-11-30

00:17:53.990,00:17:54.883,So let's look for them.,2020-11-30
00:17:54.883,00:17:56.440,Let's do the surveys.,2020-11-30
