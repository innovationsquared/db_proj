00:06:43.110,00:06:45.000,So you can get a sense of how loud it is,2022-12-24
00:06:45.000,00:06:47.790,by how dark that shock appears.,2022-12-24

00:06:53.070,00:06:53.903,"- two and a half, - It's like",2022-12-24

00:06:54.870,00:06:56.070,- You could actually measure that,2022-12-24
00:06:56.070,00:06:57.840,and calculate the Mach number.,2022-12-24
00:06:57.840,00:06:58.800,- Any object moving,2022-12-24
00:06:58.800,00:07:01.380,through air creates pressure waves that travel out,2022-12-24

00:07:05.970,00:07:09.510,the pressure waves it creates all get compressed together,2022-12-24
00:07:09.510,00:07:12.390,into a single conical shock wave.,2022-12-24
00:07:12.390,00:07:15.630,It's like a tiny sonic boom.,2022-12-24
00:07:15.630,00:07:18.600,And you can use this to determine the speed of the bullet.,2022-12-24
00:07:18.600,00:07:22.500,The sine of the angle is the ratio of the speed of sound,2022-12-24

00:07:27.780,00:07:30.000,which is with a laser sheet.,2022-12-24
00:07:30.000,00:07:32.010,It illuminates fine particles.,2022-12-24
00:07:32.010,00:07:35.640,So we can see the plumes of gun powder residue created,2022-12-24
00:07:35.640,00:07:37.530,when a gun is fired.,2022-12-24
00:07:37.530,00:07:39.570,- We call this laser light sheet.,2022-12-24
00:07:39.570,00:07:41.550,"And the reason is, okay, so now our light's there,",2022-12-24
00:07:41.550,00:07:43.890,I can barely see it because I have laser safety glasses on.,2022-12-24
00:07:43.890,00:07:45.630,- Yep. I can only see it in the camera.,2022-12-24
00:07:45.630,00:07:50.100,"- Yeah, so what's happening here is we have a laser beam,",2022-12-24
00:07:50.100,00:07:54.390,"and we send it, we steer it through a cylindrical glass rod.",2022-12-24
00:07:54.390,00:07:56.790,"All it is, is a piece of glass that's a cylinder.",2022-12-24
00:07:56.790,00:08:00.150,And what that does is it spreads that beam,2022-12-24
00:08:00.150,00:08:03.810,into a two-dimensional wall of laser light. Okay?,2022-12-24
00:08:03.810,00:08:05.760,And so the way this works is,2022-12-24
00:08:05.760,00:08:10.760,whenever particles or theatrical fog cross,2022-12-24
00:08:10.950,00:08:14.550,"through this sheet, they light up because of the laser.",2022-12-24
00:08:14.550,00:08:15.930,There's a lot of effort now going,2022-12-24
00:08:15.930,00:08:18.030,into understanding gunshot residue.,2022-12-24
00:08:18.030,00:08:21.090,So gunshot residue is the kind of burned,2022-12-24
00:08:21.090,00:08:24.570,and unburned propellant that occurs,2022-12-24
00:08:24.570,00:08:26.550,"whenever a firearm is discharged, right?",2022-12-24
00:08:26.550,00:08:29.580,So what we're looking at here is using laser lights,2022-12-24
00:08:29.580,00:08:30.720,"and high speed cameras,",2022-12-24
00:08:30.720,00:08:33.720,is we're looking at the plume of gunshot residue,2022-12-24
00:08:33.720,00:08:37.403,that's generated after a firing event.,2022-12-24
00:08:37.403,00:08:38.910,This is looking at ventilation,2022-12-24
00:08:38.910,00:08:40.230,inside an actual gun range.,2022-12-24
00:08:40.230,00:08:41.550,But look at all this.,2022-12-24
00:08:41.550,00:08:43.560,This is all gunshot residue that you can't see,2022-12-24
00:08:43.560,00:08:45.840,"with the naked eye, but is there,",2022-12-24
00:08:45.840,00:08:47.460,"so you can imagine if you're inside a home,",2022-12-24
00:08:47.460,00:08:49.740,this is five shots in a few seconds.,2022-12-24
00:08:49.740,00:08:51.660,Enormous amounts of material.,2022-12-24
00:08:51.660,00:08:54.570,"A lot of this is landing on the hands of the shooter,",2022-12-24
00:08:54.570,00:08:57.450,but unfortunately a lot of it is also being dispersed,2022-12-24
00:08:57.450,00:08:59.790,into the local environment.,2022-12-24
00:08:59.790,00:09:02.253,- It goes way farther than I expected.,2022-12-24
00:09:03.360,00:09:06.210,"- So the question is, can we differentiate",2022-12-24
00:09:06.210,00:09:10.410,between something that's actually been done by the shooter,2022-12-24
00:09:10.410,00:09:12.750,"and something, say, by a bystander that walked in",2022-12-24
00:09:12.750,00:09:13.890,two minutes later?,2022-12-24
00:09:13.890,00:09:15.810,So that this is what we're actively trying,2022-12-24
00:09:15.810,00:09:17.520,to pursue right now.,2022-12-24
00:09:17.520,00:09:21.540,So these are tools and techniques that we use here at NIST,2022-12-24
00:09:21.540,00:09:24.540,"that are qualitative or sometimes semi-quantitative,",2022-12-24
00:09:24.540,00:09:27.483,but they really help illustrate what's happening.,2022-12-24
00:09:28.980,00:09:31.380,"And then the public security part of this,",2022-12-24
00:09:31.380,00:09:33.810,deals with trace contraband detection.,2022-12-24
00:09:33.810,00:09:36.120,"We're all generating heat, right?",2022-12-24
00:09:36.120,00:09:38.250,So we all have this warm plume of air. You wanna see it?,2022-12-24
00:09:38.250,00:09:41.370,I'll show you. It's kind of crazy.,2022-12-24
00:09:41.370,00:09:42.520,So you seeing it there?,2022-12-24
00:09:43.410,00:09:45.870,So that is called the human thermal plume.,2022-12-24
00:09:45.870,00:09:48.377,And guess what's in that plume?,2022-12-24
00:09:48.377,00:09:49.830,- Water?,2022-12-24
00:09:49.830,00:09:52.113,- Parts of me. Skin cells.,2022-12-24
00:09:53.010,00:09:54.360,- No way. - Yeah.,2022-12-24
00:09:54.360,00:09:57.210,So we're shedding skin cells at a pretty creepy rate.,2022-12-24
00:09:57.210,00:09:58.860,"I forget what the number is, but it's a lot.",2022-12-24

00:10:00.750,00:10:03.510,"So we are shedding these skin cells constantly,",2022-12-24
00:10:03.510,00:10:07.050,and it's actually not necessarily a bad thing,2022-12-24
00:10:07.050,00:10:09.540,from a trace detection standpoint.,2022-12-24
00:10:09.540,00:10:10.620,- What do you mean?,2022-12-24
00:10:10.620,00:10:13.590,"- Well, whenever we are talking about trace detection,",2022-12-24
00:10:13.590,00:10:15.450,"whether it's drugs or explosives,",2022-12-24
00:10:15.450,00:10:18.000,"it's all based on this fundamental principle,",2022-12-24

00:11:31.680,00:11:33.120,So we have some acetone in here.,2022-12-24

00:13:39.000,00:13:41.130,- [Matt] So this is a way we can see how the air flow,2022-12-24
00:13:41.130,00:13:43.030,in the room is actually being tracked.,2022-12-24
00:13:44.040,00:13:44.873,"- Oh, that's nice.",2022-12-24
00:13:44.873,00:13:45.706,- [Matt] Yep.,2022-12-24
00:13:53.490,00:13:55.200,"If you look at the graph and the top right,",2022-12-24
00:13:55.200,00:13:59.310,that is actually real-time counts of the particles,2022-12-24
00:13:59.310,00:14:01.320,that are being generated around this person.,2022-12-24
00:14:01.320,00:14:06.270,So that plot represents basically inhalation exposure,2022-12-24
00:14:06.270,00:14:08.190,of the materials that he's working with.,2022-12-24
00:14:08.190,00:14:09.390,"That's crazy, if you think about,",2022-12-24
00:14:09.390,00:14:11.370,"'cause if that's fentanyl,",2022-12-24
00:14:11.370,00:14:14.310,"and that person doesn't have a mask on, they're gone.",2022-12-24
00:14:14.310,00:14:16.560,"We add fluorescent powder to this kind of stuff,",2022-12-24
00:14:16.560,00:14:20.670,so we can actually visualize where the contamination goes.,2022-12-24
00:14:20.670,00:14:22.140,The other cool part of this is,2022-12-24
00:14:22.140,00:14:24.870,that we can use a quantitative method,2022-12-24
00:14:24.870,00:14:26.760,of sampling surfaces in the house.,2022-12-24
00:14:26.760,00:14:28.440,We basically use swabbing.,2022-12-24
00:14:28.440,00:14:30.210,And it's the same idea when you go to the airport.,2022-12-24
00:14:30.210,00:14:31.800,Have you ever gone there and they ask for your hands?,2022-12-24
00:14:31.800,00:14:32.850,- Yeah. - Right? And they take,2022-12-24
00:14:32.850,00:14:34.560,a little swab and they wipe your hands.,2022-12-24
00:14:34.560,00:14:35.760,What they're doing is they're looking,2022-12-24
00:14:35.760,00:14:38.910,for these trace amounts of explosive particles,2022-12-24
00:14:38.910,00:14:41.520,that could be on you if you were involved,2022-12-24
00:14:41.520,00:14:43.830,in the manufacture of an explosive device.,2022-12-24
00:14:43.830,00:14:45.390,But that's a drone.,2022-12-24
00:14:45.390,00:14:46.223,That's looking at a drone.,2022-12-24
00:14:46.223,00:14:48.030,"And the question is, 'cause you know,",2022-12-24
00:14:48.030,00:14:49.770,"you get this cool prop wash,",2022-12-24
00:14:49.770,00:14:50.730,and these four propellers,2022-12-24
00:14:50.730,00:14:52.380,that are are all interacting with each other.,2022-12-24
00:14:52.380,00:14:55.440,"So the question is, can we use the fluid dynamics",2022-12-24
00:14:55.440,00:14:58.680,of a drone to do the sampling for us?,2022-12-24
00:14:58.680,00:14:59.700,And here's what I mean by that.,2022-12-24
00:14:59.700,00:15:01.980,"If there is a suspected, you know,",2022-12-24
00:15:01.980,00:15:04.530,"manufacturing facility of something,",2022-12-24
00:15:04.530,00:15:06.690,"say it's a methamphetamine or fentanyl,",2022-12-24
00:15:06.690,00:15:09.180,"you know, it's very, very expensive",2022-12-24
00:15:09.180,00:15:11.460,to get Hazmat crews involved.,2022-12-24
00:15:11.460,00:15:13.920,"Have them come, they have to gown up, they have to go in,",2022-12-24
00:15:13.920,00:15:16.320,to a potential really dangerous situation.,2022-12-24
00:15:16.320,00:15:19.080,What if we had a drone?,2022-12-24
00:15:19.080,00:15:21.630,"We just flew the drone in, right?",2022-12-24
00:15:21.630,00:15:24.600,It buzzes around and it's got some special kind of collector,2022-12-24
00:15:24.600,00:15:28.320,on the belly of the drone and we're using the prop wash,2022-12-24
00:15:28.320,00:15:31.320,"of the drone to stir up particles off of a surface,",2022-12-24
00:15:31.320,00:15:33.540,"and then somehow inhale them, collect them.",2022-12-24
00:15:33.540,00:15:35.070,"The drone comes back to base,",2022-12-24
00:15:35.070,00:15:36.660,"you run your chemical analysis, you say,",2022-12-24
00:15:36.660,00:15:37.890,"okay, the house is clean,",2022-12-24
00:15:37.890,00:15:39.360,"or no, we found stuff.",2022-12-24
00:15:39.360,00:15:42.210,"Okay, now it's time to pull out the Hazmat crew. You know?",2022-12-24
00:15:42.210,00:15:44.250,So the big-picture idea that I want you to keep,2022-12-24
00:15:44.250,00:15:46.440,in the back of your head the whole time is,2022-12-24
00:15:46.440,00:15:49.320,this idea of public safety and security.,2022-12-24
00:15:49.320,00:15:51.810,So that's really what happens in this lab.,2022-12-24
00:15:51.810,00:15:55.110,"But underneath that kind of umbrella term,",2022-12-24
00:15:55.110,00:15:57.180,think mask research.,2022-12-24
00:15:57.180,00:15:58.920,"So when the Covid pandemic hit,",2022-12-24
00:15:58.920,00:16:02.040,we kind of switched gears in here to try to address some,2022-12-24
00:16:02.040,00:16:03.873,of the issues related to masks.,2022-12-24
00:16:04.950,00:16:07.920,"This thing will actually breathe as a human does,",2022-12-24
00:16:07.920,00:16:09.330,that human happens to be me.,2022-12-24
00:16:09.330,00:16:11.160,"So I measured my own kind of breathing rate,",2022-12-24
00:16:11.160,00:16:12.720,"and then built a system,",2022-12-24
00:16:12.720,00:16:16.050,"kinda engineered a pneumatic system that replicates that,",2022-12-24
00:16:16.050,00:16:19.470,"but it also has a fog machine, a fog generator.",2022-12-24
00:16:19.470,00:16:22.080,So this thing basically just looks like it took a drag off,2022-12-24
00:16:22.080,00:16:23.730,of a cigarette and exhaled.,2022-12-24
00:16:23.730,00:16:25.380,What's kind of cool with this is,2022-12-24
00:16:25.380,00:16:27.810,"it looks like there's nothing coming through, right?",2022-12-24
00:16:27.810,00:16:28.980,But there is millions and millions,2022-12-24
00:16:28.980,00:16:31.350,of particles trying to make it through.,2022-12-24
00:16:31.350,00:16:33.510,"Some do, 'cause it's not 100%.",2022-12-24
00:16:33.510,00:16:36.060,So I wrote an image-processing code.,2022-12-24
00:16:36.060,00:16:38.730,"So you take this information, you plug it into a code,",2022-12-24
00:16:38.730,00:16:40.350,"and it analyzes,",2022-12-24
00:16:40.350,00:16:43.350,"based on pixels and it's counting white pixels,",2022-12-24
00:16:43.350,00:16:46.170,"and sure enough, if you use an N95,",2022-12-24
00:16:46.170,00:16:47.400,"you put an N95 on here,",2022-12-24
00:16:47.400,00:16:50.040,"you run it through an image processing code,",2022-12-24
00:16:50.040,00:16:53.850,guess what percentage of pixels light up white?,2022-12-24
00:16:53.850,00:16:54.710,- 5%?,2022-12-24
00:16:54.710,00:16:55.543,- 5%.,2022-12-24
00:16:56.430,00:16:57.330,- Okay. - Now I just want you,2022-12-24
00:16:57.330,00:16:58.563,to breathe naturally.,2022-12-24
00:17:01.560,00:17:04.260,"So when you're inhaling, it gets dark.",2022-12-24
00:17:04.260,00:17:06.030,"And when you're exhaling, it gets lighter,",2022-12-24
00:17:06.030,00:17:08.760,because the air is being warmed by your lungs,2022-12-24
00:17:08.760,00:17:10.410,and then coming back out.,2022-12-24
00:17:10.410,00:17:12.690,- Like it's interesting how fast you can see,2022-12-24
00:17:12.690,00:17:14.703,"the effect of the breathing in,",2022-12-24
00:17:15.602,00:17:17.847,like just makes it go dark so quickly.,2022-12-24
00:17:17.847,00:17:19.097,"- But that shows me that,",2022-12-24
00:17:20.108,00:17:21.480,like this now doesn't change color at all.,2022-12-24
00:17:21.480,00:17:23.883,So this is being used to seal versus filter.,2022-12-24
00:17:26.268,00:17:29.400,I notice the color change is a lot more dramatic.,2022-12-24
00:17:29.400,00:17:30.233,- Yeah.,2022-12-24
00:17:30.233,00:17:31.487,"- With this, you know, it was in and out.",2022-12-24
00:17:31.487,00:17:34.830,"- I feel like that's a thinner mask, right?",2022-12-24
00:17:34.830,00:17:36.120,"- [Matt] Yeah. So the heat transfer-through,",2022-12-24
00:17:36.120,00:17:37.270,it is gonna be greater.,2022-12-24
00:17:40.200,00:17:41.610,- I feel like there's a lot coming out,2022-12-24
00:17:41.610,00:17:42.443,"over the top. - There is, yeah,",2022-12-24
00:17:42.443,00:17:43.320,there's a lot.,2022-12-24
00:17:43.320,00:17:45.840,"If you just breathe naturally,",2022-12-24
00:17:45.840,00:17:47.643,you'll see a lot coming out there.,2022-12-24
00:17:53.490,00:17:55.170,"- The thing with masks, right, is like,",2022-12-24
00:17:55.170,00:17:57.690,"initially they were like, masks don't work,",2022-12-24
00:17:57.690,00:17:59.250,don't wear a mask.,2022-12-24
00:17:59.250,00:18:01.530,"And then they were like, masks do work,",2022-12-24
00:18:01.530,00:18:03.000,"like, and wear a cloth mask,",2022-12-24
00:18:03.000,00:18:04.973,"and then they were like, no, no cloth masks don't work,",2022-12-24
00:18:04.973,00:18:07.170,"like, I don't know, there was a lot of confusion",2022-12-24
00:18:07.170,00:18:08.340,around masks.,2022-12-24
00:18:08.340,00:18:12.870,"- What we learned early on was that the communication of,",2022-12-24
00:18:12.870,00:18:16.500,"you know, mask effectiveness could have been improved,",2022-12-24
00:18:16.500,00:18:18.570,right? And so that's kind of why I did what we did,2022-12-24
00:18:18.570,00:18:19.710,with the Schlieren.,2022-12-24
00:18:19.710,00:18:22.740,"The truth is, the average American is not gonna sit down",2022-12-24
00:18:22.740,00:18:24.720,and read a scientific journal article.,2022-12-24
00:18:24.720,00:18:29.190,But they will sit down and watch a 90-second video,2022-12-24
00:18:29.190,00:18:31.590,of me coughing with a mask on and off.,2022-12-24
00:18:31.590,00:18:32.740,And that's what we did.,2022-12-24
00:18:35.970,00:18:37.890,It's kind of a unique relationship we have,2022-12-24
00:18:37.890,00:18:39.630,with other federal agencies here.,2022-12-24
00:18:39.630,00:18:42.300,So you have a three-letter agency that has a specific need,2022-12-24
00:18:42.300,00:18:43.320,"for something, right?",2022-12-24
00:18:43.320,00:18:46.140,In the security arena.,2022-12-24
00:18:46.140,00:18:48.570,"What they'll often do is they'll come here to NIST,",2022-12-24
00:18:48.570,00:18:49.403,"and they'll say,",2022-12-24
00:18:49.403,00:18:51.660,"hey, we're really interested in sampling people's shoes",2022-12-24
00:18:51.660,00:18:53.790,"for explosives for whatever reason, right?",2022-12-24
00:18:53.790,00:18:56.400,"So what we do here, and in this lab in particular,",2022-12-24
00:18:56.400,00:18:59.820,is we figure out what are some good ways to sample shoes,2022-12-24
00:18:59.820,00:19:01.470,for explosives?,2022-12-24
00:19:01.470,00:19:03.903,"What are some not so good ways, right?",2022-12-24
00:19:03.903,00:19:07.230,What do the measurements need to look like,2022-12-24
00:19:07.230,00:19:09.900,to evaluate a shoe-sampling system,2022-12-24
00:19:09.900,00:19:11.100,that doesn't even exist yet?,2022-12-24
00:19:11.100,00:19:13.950,And then what do the standards need to look like,2022-12-24
00:19:13.950,00:19:16.167,"that support those measurements, right?",2022-12-24
00:19:16.167,00:19:18.930,"And so we figure all this stuff out in the lab,",2022-12-24
00:19:18.930,00:19:20.580,"package it up nice and neat,",2022-12-24
00:19:20.580,00:19:22.230,"give it back to the sponsoring agency,",2022-12-24
00:19:22.230,00:19:24.810,and then they take it to industry.,2022-12-24
00:19:24.810,00:19:28.440,And industry already has a leg up on the development,2022-12-24
00:19:28.440,00:19:29.460,"of these kinds of systems,",2022-12-24
00:19:29.460,00:19:32.610,because we did a lot of the heavy lifting here in the lab.,2022-12-24
00:19:32.610,00:19:35.520,"Because with the success of, you know,",2022-12-24
00:19:35.520,00:19:38.490,"doing the Covid-related visualization,",2022-12-24
00:19:38.490,00:19:40.590,we're realizing now that the application space,2022-12-24
00:19:40.590,00:19:43.620,for this kind of technology is huge.,2022-12-24
00:19:43.620,00:19:45.240,Indoor air quality.,2022-12-24
00:19:45.240,00:19:47.340,You can imagine a bigger mirror where we could look,2022-12-24

00:19:52.980,00:19:56.040,The take-home message is flow visualization,2022-12-24
00:19:56.040,00:19:58.740,is a critical tool that we use here at NIST,2022-12-24
