00:00:00.260,00:00:01.260,All right.,2013-11-29
00:00:01.260,00:00:02.260,Let’s watch it.,2013-11-29
00:00:02.260,00:00:03.699,Hopefully I am not horribly wrong.,2013-11-29
00:00:03.699,00:00:06.370,Derek is giggling to himself right now.,2013-11-29
00:00:06.370,00:00:08.460,"&gt;&gt; Ok, you have made your prediction.",2013-11-29

00:00:12.870,00:00:15.610,the one that is shot right into the center of mass.,2013-11-29
00:00:15.610,00:00:18.720,"Ok, we are just getting set for shooting straight into the block.",2013-11-29
00:00:18.720,00:00:20.580,"How are you feeling about this one, Dave?",2013-11-29
00:00:20.580,00:00:21.590,&gt;&gt; I think this is the one.,2013-11-29
00:00:21.590,00:00:22.869,I really do.,2013-11-29
00:00:22.869,00:00:23.869,&gt;&gt; Ok.,2013-11-29
00:00:23.869,00:00:27.410,Range is going hot.,2013-11-29
00:00:27.410,00:00:31.050,"In three, two, one.",2013-11-29
00:00:31.050,00:00:36.870,&gt;&gt; We have moved this block so now the gun is actually firing into the right side of,2013-11-29
00:00:36.870,00:00:37.870,the block.,2013-11-29
00:00:37.870,00:00:45.329,So presumably one imagines that the block will spin anticlockwise.,2013-11-29

00:01:00.519,00:01:04.960,&gt;&gt; Now check out the high speed footage.,2013-11-29
00:01:04.960,00:01:10.030,"You can clearly see that both blocks go to the exact same height, even though one is",2013-11-29

00:01:11.030,00:01:15.530,"And that is a bit strange, because they were both hit by the same type of bullet from the",2013-11-29
00:01:15.530,00:01:18.330,"same rifle, so presumably it had the same kinetic energy.",2013-11-29
00:01:18.330,00:01:23.390,"And they both go the same height so they both have the same gravitational potential energy,",2013-11-29
00:01:23.390,00:01:25.800,but one is rotating.,2013-11-29
00:01:25.800,00:01:28.570,And so it has that additional rotational energy.,2013-11-29
00:01:28.570,00:01:31.720,So one block has more energy than the other block.,2013-11-29

00:01:34.520,00:01:35.520,&gt;&gt; Talk to me.,2013-11-29
00:01:35.520,00:01:39.229,"&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean so you are telling me you just created energy.",2013-11-29
00:01:39.229,00:01:40.810,&gt;&gt; Not necessarily created energy.,2013-11-29
00:01:40.810,00:01:43.140,So what are you thinking there?,2013-11-29
00:01:43.140,00:01:45.050,&gt;&gt; I am potentially surprised.,2013-11-29

00:01:46.460,00:01:50.020,&gt;&gt; Obviously I am wrong.,2013-11-29
00:01:50.020,00:01:57.600,"&gt;&gt; I think went up to the same height, which is incredibly confusing to me.",2013-11-29
00:01:57.600,00:01:58.600,&gt;&gt; Why is that confusing?,2013-11-29
00:01:58.600,00:01:59.890,&gt;&gt; Because that doesn’t... where is that extra energy coming from?,2013-11-29
00:01:59.890,00:02:02.780,"&gt;&gt; Well, the fact is that one block clearly does have more energy.",2013-11-29

00:02:10.530,00:02:12.760,&gt;&gt; How is that possible and why is it happening?,2013-11-29
00:02:12.760,00:02:13.760,&gt;&gt; No.,2013-11-29
00:02:13.760,00:02:16.699,Explain it to me.,2013-11-29
00:02:16.699,00:02:17.979,&gt;&gt; I don’t want to give you the answer right away.,2013-11-29
