00:00:05.700,00:00:10.700,This piece has a mass of just 1.22 grams.,2019-05-31
00:00:11.580,00:00:18.440,"That is only a few times the mass of the same volume of air, which kind of makes sense because it is",2019-05-31
00:00:18.800,00:00:25.160,"99.8% air. In fact, some aerogels are so light that if you removed all the air from them,",2019-05-31
00:00:25.330,00:00:30.840,they would be less dense than air. I have long been fascinated by aerogel,2019-05-31
00:00:30.840,00:00:37.559,so I actually flew out to Aerogel Technologies in Boston to find out why was aerogel invented. How is it made?,2019-05-31
00:00:37.960,00:00:41.610,Why is it such a good thermal insulator and what is it used for?,2019-05-31
00:00:42.190,00:00:49.980,"- Okay, we are going to try an experiment to demonstrate the insulating power of aerogel so over here we have",2019-05-31
00:00:50.680,00:00:56.849,"two setups: one with a glass petri dish, and the other one with aerogel on top.",2019-05-31
00:00:56.860,00:01:00.989,"- Both are made of silica, but with very different physical structures.",2019-05-31
00:01:01.329,00:01:05.279,We're gonna see how long it takes to melt these chocolate bunnies with a Bunsen burner.,2019-05-31
00:01:05.890,00:01:08.220,"- Now to have a look at this experiment,",2019-05-31
00:01:08.240,00:01:14.220,"we have a FLIR T1020 which can see temperatures up to 2,000 degrees Celsius.",2019-05-31
00:01:14.300,00:01:14.940,- Looks like it's getting pretty hot.,2019-05-31
00:01:15.000,00:01:20.120,"- Yeah, you can see that the glass is getting really hot already. And after just a minute:",2019-05-31
00:01:20.140,00:01:23.680,- It's starting to smoke. - Okay.,2019-05-31
00:01:23.940,00:01:25.340,- It's definitely melting and smoking.,2019-05-31
00:01:25.600,00:01:29.120,"Oh, yeah, here we go. I would say that's phase change.",2019-05-31
00:01:29.280,00:01:30.660,- We've got,2019-05-31
00:01:30.670,00:01:34.860,"a liquid chocolate situation. We have some smoking bunny. Over here,",2019-05-31
00:01:34.860,00:01:39.560,"the bunny is actually sort of melting over, and look, there, it's sort of tilting to the side.",2019-05-31
00:01:39.820,00:01:43.120,"- Alright, I think we're going to call that a melt.",2019-05-31
00:01:43.440,00:01:44.520,- What is that? - Oh!,2019-05-31
00:01:44.640,00:01:45.840,"On cue, on cue.",2019-05-31
00:01:46.320,00:01:47.960,[Laughs.],2019-05-31
00:01:48.720,00:01:50.500,- I would say that is material fail.,2019-05-31
00:01:50.520,00:01:55.120,"- Not only did the bunny melt quickly, the petri dish cracked under the thermal expansion.",2019-05-31
00:01:55.240,00:01:55.740,- Wanna pop it in?,2019-05-31
00:01:55.840,00:01:57.640,- So now let's try the aerogel.,2019-05-31
00:01:58.660,00:02:01.340,[Music] - So how is aerogel invented back in?,2019-05-31
00:02:01.340,00:02:07.340,"- Back in 1931, a guy named Professor Samuel Kistler had a bet with his colleague Charles Learned.",2019-05-31
00:02:07.600,00:02:12.700,"- Now the bet revolved around jellies, like peanut-butter-and-jelly jellies.",2019-05-31
00:02:12.700,00:02:17.780,Now the thing about jellies is they are actually a combination of liquids and solids.,2019-05-31
00:02:17.860,00:02:18.360,[Music],2019-05-31
00:02:18.360,00:02:24.000,"I mean, they're mostly liquid, but it's embedded within this 3D solid structure.",2019-05-31
00:02:24.000,00:02:29.980,"- So if you think of a gel, like jello, has a skeleton with nano-sized pores that gives it its rigidity,",2019-05-31
00:02:29.980,00:02:32.580,and then that's about 1% of the gel.,2019-05-31
00:02:32.580,00:02:33.940,- So the bet was this:,2019-05-31
00:02:33.940,00:02:37.000,Could you remove the liquid from the jelly?,2019-05-31
00:02:37.580,00:02:43.690,"Without affecting the solid structure? I mean, if you just evaporate the liquid out, well,",2019-05-31
00:02:43.690,00:02:50.640,"then the solid structure shrinks, because as you remove liquid molecules, they pull on each other,",2019-05-31
00:02:50.640,00:02:55.980,"and they pull on the solid structure around them, basically crumpling it from the inside.",2019-05-31
00:02:56.180,00:03:00.360,Now Samuel Kistler solved this problem in two ways.,2019-05-31
00:03:00.360,00:03:04.200,"First, he realized you could replace one liquid with another",2019-05-31
00:03:04.400,00:03:08.739,"inside the jelly just by washing it thoroughly. So you could swap out, say,",2019-05-31
00:03:09.020,00:03:16.220,"water, for alcohol. And then, if you take the jelly and put it in a high-pressure vessel called a autoclave,",2019-05-31
00:03:16.340,00:03:21.680,"- By heating it to the high-temperature, high-pressure point called the critical point of the liquid,",2019-05-31
00:03:21.680,00:03:26.540,"that liquid transformed into a semi-liquid, semi-gas called a supercritical fluid.",2019-05-31
00:03:26.680,00:03:30.380,"- At this point, there is no longer a distinction between liquid and gas.",2019-05-31
00:03:30.560,00:03:33.740,Those molecules are no longer pulling on each other.,2019-05-31
00:03:33.740,00:03:40.820,"- So once you've depressurized the vessel, that solid skeleton, that 1% of the mass of the gel, is left behind",2019-05-31
00:03:40.960,00:03:45.240,"intact, except for where there was liquid in the pores before is now gas,",2019-05-31
00:03:45.340,00:03:49.900,"and that solid skeleton, that nanoporous solid is what we call aerogel.",2019-05-31
00:03:50.100,00:03:53.260,- Kistler published his findings in Nature in 1931.,2019-05-31
00:03:54.820,00:03:58.380,It is getting pretty hot as you can see through the thermal camera.,2019-05-31
00:03:58.380,00:04:01.920,"But coming up on three minutes, there's still no sign of melted chocolate.",2019-05-31
00:04:02.340,00:04:06.440,So we're gonna pull out a thermocouple and just check the temperature underneath the bunny.,2019-05-31
00:04:06.440,00:04:09.620,"Like, underneath the aerogel, and see what, what the flame temperature is.",2019-05-31
00:04:09.640,00:04:14.529,"You can kind of see that, that parts of the bunny are getting hot, but it's not the bottom of the bunny,",2019-05-31
00:04:14.750,00:04:16.885,"It's all the, around the bunny.",2019-05-31
00:04:16.885,00:04:21.060,"- Exactly. That convective heat is moving up and around the aerogel,",2019-05-31
00:04:21.060,00:04:25.180,"- So you can see the thing is getting red hot. - And by four minutes, the bunny is looking a little soft.",2019-05-31
00:04:25.180,00:04:28.458,"- Still pretty good though, considering how easy it is to melt chocolate.",2019-05-31
00:04:28.780,00:04:29.900,- Can I put my finger here?,2019-05-31
00:04:30.920,00:04:31.660,- Be careful.,2019-05-31
00:04:32.980,00:04:36.440,"It's not that it's hot, it's that it's brittle. - Right.",2019-05-31
00:04:37.460,00:04:41.900,"- But yeah, totally cool to touch, right? - It is, it is just warm to the touch.",2019-05-31
00:04:42.120,00:04:44.620,- He made aerogels out of all sorts of things.,2019-05-31
00:04:44.840,00:04:49.080,"He made them out of eggs. He made them out of rubber, out of nitrocellulose.",2019-05-31
00:04:49.280,00:04:56.160,"And, included in there was silica. Actually right here on the table, I have some examples of some silica gels.",2019-05-31
00:04:56.340,00:04:58.840,"This is a, a wet silica gel",2019-05-31
00:04:58.840,00:05:02.600,"It's kind of rubbery so I can just, you know, carve out a piece.",2019-05-31
00:05:02.600,00:05:08.060,It is 97% alcohol inside of its pores.,2019-05-31
00:05:08.300,00:05:12.380,And then the remaining 3% solid is amorphous silica. Just--,2019-05-31
00:05:12.380,00:05:16.500,"- Can I touch it? - Yeah, absolutely. It's kind of rubbery. Not that strong.",2019-05-31
00:05:17.180,00:05:19.440,- So was I cracking it there or was it already kinda cracked?,2019-05-31
00:05:19.440,00:05:22.560,"- Yeah, you just, no-- - Oh whoa, it's very easy to break. Very crumbly.",2019-05-31
00:05:22.820,00:05:27.280,- The next step is to replace the alcohol in the gel with liquid carbon dioxide.,2019-05-31
00:05:27.280,00:05:29.400,- We're about to see liquid CO₂.,2019-05-31
00:05:29.540,00:05:34.360,"- Liquid CO₂ has the advantage of being non-flammable, plus it's got a low critical temperature.",2019-05-31
00:05:34.360,00:05:36.220,"- Open it up, and-- - Yeah, I see it flooding in there.",2019-05-31
00:05:36.360,00:05:39.100,"- Yeah, it's flooding in. There it goes. Just another solvent.",2019-05-31

00:05:40.580,00:05:44.480,- You can clearly see that it's so much cooler on top.,2019-05-31
00:05:45.740,00:05:49.120,- What temperature is it on the bottom? - We're at 600 right now?,2019-05-31

00:05:53.920,00:05:56.180,- Notice where the bunny is melting.,2019-05-31
00:05:56.180,00:06:02.560,"It's melting right on that edge where the heat's, like, the flame is kind of crawling up and over. - So, yeah, that's",2019-05-31
00:06:02.700,00:06:03.440,- Oh!,2019-05-31
00:06:03.660,00:06:05.660,Bunny down! [Laughs.],2019-05-31
00:06:06.260,00:06:09.840,"- Well, not a bad result. - Not a bad result at all.",2019-05-31
00:06:10.180,00:06:12.880,- I'm interested in in tasting some of this chocolate here.,2019-05-31
00:06:13.580,00:06:14.080,( - Gross.),2019-05-31
00:06:16.720,00:06:17.860,- Is it hot?,2019-05-31
00:06:17.860,00:06:19.140,- It's warm.  - Warm.,2019-05-31
00:06:19.140,00:06:20.780,- And delicious. - Like fondue.,2019-05-31
00:06:20.820,00:06:22.800,- Mm-hmm. That was great.,2019-05-31
00:06:23.020,00:06:28.020,"Once the liquid CO₂ has filled all the pores of the gel, it's time to take it supercritical.",2019-05-31

00:06:33.540,00:06:34.480,- We'll get to that here.,2019-05-31
00:06:34.480,00:06:37.740,- [Laughs.] I love how much you're into these autoclaves. - I love aerogels.,2019-05-31

00:06:39.640,00:06:43.100,we can heat this with a hairdryer actually.,2019-05-31

00:06:51.860,00:06:54.480,"- That is like weird waves in there, yeah.",2019-05-31
00:06:54.480,00:06:57.820,I'll speed it up so you can watch the surface disappear altogether.,2019-05-31
00:06:58.580,00:07:02.140,You're now looking at the supercritical fluid of CO₂.,2019-05-31

00:07:09.020,00:07:09.840,♫,2019-05-31
00:07:10.440,00:07:13.340,"- If you look at aerogel on a light background,",2019-05-31
00:07:13.740,00:07:18.160,"it's almost impossible to see, because it is pretty transparent.",2019-05-31
00:07:18.740,00:07:22.600,"But if you look at it on a darker background,",2019-05-31
00:07:23.180,00:07:27.480,then you can see that it has a slight bluish color.,2019-05-31
00:07:28.160,00:07:31.440,"And, it's bluish for the same reason that the sky is blue,",2019-05-31
00:07:31.640,00:07:35.280,"because all those tiny little nanoscale structures,",2019-05-31
00:07:35.360,00:07:38.280,they scatter the light according to Rayleigh scattering.,2019-05-31
00:07:38.360,00:07:43.560,"And, the intensity of light scattered is proportional to 1 over wavelength to the power of 4,",2019-05-31
00:07:43.560,00:07:49.300,"which means it scatters shorter wavelengths, like blue, much more than it scatters yellow or red.",2019-05-31
00:07:49.940,00:07:55.640,"And, for that reason, aerogel looks opaque in the ultraviolet and transparent in the infrared.",2019-05-31
00:07:56.760,00:08:00.560,"- Now, what do you think this would look like if I held it up to the blue sky?",2019-05-31
00:08:00.880,00:08:03.840,What do you think we would see? Would it look ultra blue?,2019-05-31
00:08:05.720,00:08:13.040,"No, it looks yellow. And that's because the aerogel is actually scattering out that blue light,",2019-05-31
00:08:13.040,00:08:18.400,and so what passes through and makes it to our eyes is the longer wavelengths like the yellows and oranges.,2019-05-31
00:08:18.920,00:08:22.160,It's basically the same effect as looking at a sunset,2019-05-31
00:08:22.660,00:08:25.020,"When you see the yellows and oranges of a sunset,",2019-05-31
00:08:25.120,00:08:27.440,it's because the blue light has already been scattered out,2019-05-31
00:08:27.440,00:08:31.880,by the atmosphere the light had to pass through before it reached your eyes.,2019-05-31
00:08:32.800,00:08:38.100,So effectively looking at aerogel against blue sky is like looking at a portable sunset.,2019-05-31
00:08:38.380,00:08:43.200,The nanoscale pores of the aerogel are also what makes it such a good thermal insulator.,2019-05-31
00:08:43.600,00:08:44.100,( - Three.),2019-05-31
00:08:47.620,00:08:48.120,- That's awesome.,2019-05-31
00:08:48.300,00:08:50.120,- Does that look hot? - It's definitely hot.,2019-05-31
00:08:50.160,00:08:54.260,- You might think that because aerogel is,2019-05-31
00:08:54.380,00:08:57.080,"largely comprised of air, like 99% air,",2019-05-31
00:08:57.780,00:09:02.160,"that it has the same thermal properties as air, but that is not correct.",2019-05-31
00:09:02.170,00:09:04.810,It's actually a better insulator than air is.,2019-05-31
00:09:05.200,00:09:10.620,- That's because the width of the pores is smaller than the distance air molecules travel on average,2019-05-31
00:09:10.680,00:09:12.020,before colliding with something.,2019-05-31
00:09:12.420,00:09:14.340,Their so-called mean free path.,2019-05-31
00:09:14.680,00:09:19.880,"Hence, it's really difficult for the hot, fast-moving air molecules below the aerogel",2019-05-31
00:09:19.880,00:09:23.640,to diffuse through it and transfer heat to the top of the aerogel.,2019-05-31
00:09:23.720,00:09:27.740,This is called the Knudsen effect. - It is so weird because,2019-05-31
00:09:28.120,00:09:36.060,"you know, you don't expect something that's transparent to block the heat that well, but this really does.",2019-05-31
00:09:36.589,00:09:40.389,"- And that's why NASA used aerogel insulation on the Sojourner Rover,",2019-05-31
00:09:41.080,00:09:46.920,"Spirit and Opportunity, the Curiosity Rover, and they plan to use it on future missions to Mars.",2019-05-31
00:09:47.180,00:09:50.280,"- Why does it need insulation? - The electronics, because",2019-05-31
00:09:50.680,00:09:55.380,they don't want the electronics to get cold during the cold nights on Mars,2019-05-31
00:09:55.800,00:09:59.240,"- NASA has also put aerogel to more exotic uses,",2019-05-31
00:09:59.240,00:10:02.980,notably to catch dust from a comet as part of the Stardust mission.,2019-05-31
00:10:03.220,00:10:08.440,- So the particles were traveling about six kilometers per second relative to the aerogel,2019-05-31
00:10:08.700,00:10:15.080,"So when they hit the aerogel, because the aerogel's a very low density material, very, very porous material,",2019-05-31
00:10:15.080,00:10:20.460,"the particles actually enter the aerogel, and as they travel through the aerogel,",2019-05-31
00:10:20.580,00:10:26.360,they basically break apart the network that makes up the aerogel and they lose energy in the process,2019-05-31
00:10:26.360,00:10:27.960,and eventually come to a stop.,2019-05-31
00:10:28.120,00:10:29.720,"This is good for capturing particles,",2019-05-31
00:10:29.720,00:10:34.440,"because if a particle like that were to hit a solid surface then it just stops, you know, immediately.",2019-05-31
00:10:34.440,00:10:36.520,- It just vaporizes. - And vaporizes.,2019-05-31
00:10:36.620,00:10:40.989,- So should we expect to see aerogel in our everyday lives anytime soon?,2019-05-31
00:10:40.989,00:10:47.840,"- One of my running jokes is when they build skyscrapers in Antarctica, they'll use aerogel as thermal insulation.",2019-05-31

00:10:49.640,00:10:50.840,- Why do you say that?,2019-05-31
00:10:50.840,00:10:53.660,"- Well, because then they'll really care about how,",2019-05-31
00:10:53.660,00:10:56.680,just how thermal efficient it is because it would be so cold there.,2019-05-31
00:10:56.680,00:10:57.180,- Right.,2019-05-31
00:10:57.240,00:11:04.900,"- So instead of having, you know, ten feet of fiberglass insulation, you could have six inches or something of aerogel.",2019-05-31
00:11:05.420,00:11:09.560,- Scientists are currently working on reducing costs and increasing durability.,2019-05-31
00:11:10.060,00:11:12.310,- And that's true. They do have some elasticity. - Okay.,2019-05-31
00:11:12.310,00:11:15.910,"- Yeah, so there we go. So it is not hard to break.",2019-05-31
00:11:16.160,00:11:21.549,"- They've already made a lot of progress. For example, original silica aerogel is hydrophilic.",2019-05-31
00:11:22.160,00:11:25.980,- There we go. Now this is a hydrophilic aerogel.,2019-05-31
00:11:26.020,00:11:30.500,"- So once we've done this, is that piece of aerogel ruined now?",2019-05-31
00:11:30.500,00:11:31.220,- Pretty much.,2019-05-31
00:11:31.340,00:11:33.920,- But there are ways to make it waterproof.,2019-05-31
00:11:34.240,00:11:38.020,"So if you want to see that and all the other next generation aerogels,",2019-05-31
00:11:38.020,00:11:42.880,then subscribe to the channel and this may be the start of an aerogel trilogy.,2019-05-31
