00:03:01.777,00:03:05.600,So why is LA Reservoir covered in shade balls?,2019-05-10
00:03:05.600,00:03:08.220,"Well, the the problem all started with Bromide.",2019-05-10
00:03:08.220,00:03:10.840,- Bromide is a naturally occurring substance.,2019-05-10
00:03:10.840,00:03:12.820,It's associated with salt water,2019-05-10
00:03:12.820,00:03:16.870,"and so normally places like California Aqueduct,",2019-05-10
00:03:16.870,00:03:18.540,that comes down from the Delta.,2019-05-10
00:03:18.540,00:03:19.970,"You get some some salt water intrusions,",2019-05-10
00:03:19.970,00:03:21.510,so you have some Bromide in the water.,2019-05-10
00:03:21.510,00:03:24.623,Bromide's harmless and it's almost impossible to remove.,2019-05-10
00:03:24.623,00:03:27.920,"But, when you disinfect the water with Ozone,",2019-05-10
00:03:27.920,00:03:30.440,that Bromide becomes Bromate.,2019-05-10
00:03:30.440,00:03:31.750,And Bromate is carcinogenic.,2019-05-10
00:03:31.750,00:03:35.010,And so around the year 2000 they wrote regulations,2019-05-10
00:03:35.010,00:03:35.960,regulating Bromate.,2019-05-10
00:03:35.960,00:03:37.760,"And the regulation basically said,",2019-05-10
00:03:37.760,00:03:40.110,"if you have a treatment plant that uses Ozone,",2019-05-10
00:03:40.110,00:03:42.870,then you have to watch your Bromate formation.,2019-05-10
00:03:42.870,00:03:44.080,Be careful not to form too much.,2019-05-10
00:03:44.080,00:03:46.220,"So, the only places we ever measured Bromate",2019-05-10
00:03:46.220,00:03:47.550,was at our filter plant.,2019-05-10
00:03:47.550,00:03:49.200,- [Narrator] And the results were always within the,2019-05-10
00:03:49.200,00:03:52.480,10 micrograms per liter limit set by regulators.,2019-05-10
00:03:52.480,00:03:54.350,So they were confused when they got a call,2019-05-10
00:03:54.350,00:03:57.400,"from one of their customers, a beverage company in LA.",2019-05-10
00:03:57.400,00:03:59.230,"- They said, ""We have some really high levels",2019-05-10

00:04:01.240,00:04:03.670,"And we said, ""Well, we don't show anything.""",2019-05-10

00:04:07.580,00:04:09.730,So they did some tests.,2019-05-10
00:04:09.730,00:04:11.130,- Almost immediately upon coming,2019-05-10
00:04:11.130,00:04:12.630,"into to this open reservoir,",2019-05-10
00:04:12.630,00:04:14.600,the Bromate levels jumped.,2019-05-10
00:04:14.600,00:04:17.540,"It turned out that Bromide with Chlorine,",2019-05-10
00:04:17.540,00:04:18.960,"which was supposed to be safe,",2019-05-10
00:04:18.960,00:04:21.280,in bright sunlight formed Bromate,2019-05-10
00:04:21.280,00:04:23.050,even more than Ozone did.,2019-05-10
00:04:23.050,00:04:25.743,And so we made the unfortunate scientific discovery,2019-05-10
00:04:25.743,00:04:29.010,that actually was not part of any regulatory scheme.,2019-05-10
00:04:29.010,00:04:31.400,"And so, here we are at the reservoir,",2019-05-10
00:04:31.400,00:04:34.520,"we have a water source that's got Bromide in it, harmless,",2019-05-10
00:04:34.520,00:04:37.120,"we have chlorine, we have to have to disinfect the water",2019-05-10
00:04:37.120,00:04:39.110,and we have sunlight because it's open.,2019-05-10
00:04:39.110,00:04:40.730,The only choice we have is to remove sunlight.,2019-05-10
00:04:40.730,00:04:42.660,"So, we looked at all sorts of things.",2019-05-10
00:04:42.660,00:04:45.760,"We looked at floating tarps across the water,",2019-05-10

00:05:06.110,00:05:08.140,can we get float a pile of pipe across the surface.,2019-05-10

00:05:12.983,00:05:14.270,and we can run it through a chipper,2019-05-10

00:06:46.070,00:06:48.240,is to block all light from reaching the water,2019-05-10
00:06:48.240,00:06:50.540,and triggering the Bromate reaction.,2019-05-10

00:09:15.070,00:09:17.820,"In an open reservoir, there is more exposed surface area",2019-05-10
00:09:17.820,00:09:20.470,where water molecules can escape into the air.,2019-05-10
00:09:20.470,00:09:23.130,"Plus, there is greater air flow over the water's surface",2019-05-10

00:09:38.740,00:09:40.720,and so not much of the heat is transferred,2019-05-10
