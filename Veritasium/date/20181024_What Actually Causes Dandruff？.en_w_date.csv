00:00:00.000,00:00:03.720,Hey! This episode was sponsored by Head &amp; Shoulders.,2018-10-24
00:00:05.760,00:00:13.040,"A hundred and twenty-five million years ago in what is now China, dinosaurs walked the earth.",2018-10-24
00:00:14.620,00:00:18.360,and a few species of small feathered dinosaurs climbed trees,2018-10-24
00:00:19.120,00:00:21.300,This is Sinornithosaurus,2018-10-24
00:00:21.800,00:00:27.960,"Although they couldn't truly fly, they could glide, which helped them evade predators and catch prey",2018-10-24
00:00:28.820,00:00:33.580,What makes these dinosaurs unique is how well-preserved their fossils were.,2018-10-24
00:00:34.600,00:00:38.740,Normally when you find a dinosaur it's just a pile of bones and that's all there is.,2018-10-24
00:00:38.740,00:00:43.620,In between the feathers and the parts of the feather we saw little bits of skin,2018-10-24
00:00:43.620,00:00:49.200,And you can tell that they are skin - they're not just random bits of rock or broken up bone or something,2018-10-24
00:00:49.200,00:00:52.620,because they have a particular kind of cells within the structure,2018-10-24
00:00:52.620,00:00:56.880,which are just like the skin cells that we find in humans today,2018-10-24
00:00:57.540,00:01:00.860,"Well, my first thought when I saw these was this is dinosaur dandruff",2018-10-24
00:01:00.860,00:01:07.400,"and I was already planning to write the paper with the headline of we have discovered dinosaur dandruff,",2018-10-24
00:01:07.400,00:01:08.800,I thought great.,2018-10-24
00:01:08.800,00:01:13.920,So these dinosaurs may have had the first known case of dandruff.,2018-10-24
00:01:13.920,00:01:15.700,But it certainly wasn't the last,2018-10-24
00:01:15.700,00:01:19.360,Our skin cells are constantly replenishing themselves,2018-10-24
00:01:19.360,00:01:23.880,in fact every second 500 new skin cells are created,2018-10-24
00:01:23.880,00:01:27.700,"and as they move up through the outer layer of your skin, the epidermis",2018-10-24
00:01:27.700,00:01:32.800,They flatten out and harden until they fall off one by one,2018-10-24
00:01:32.800,00:01:38.440,In fact over your lifetime you will shed about a hundred pounds of dead skin,2018-10-24
00:01:38.440,00:01:43.740,But we don't really notice this because skin falls off in such tiny microscopic pieces,2018-10-24
00:01:43.740,00:01:50.180,except for some people from some parts of the body skin comes off in larger flakes,2018-10-24
00:01:50.180,00:01:55.300,typically from the skin under the hair the scalp and this is what's known as dandruff,2018-10-24
00:01:55.300,00:01:59.540,Now around half of everyone on earth suffers from it.,2018-10-24
00:01:59.540,00:02:03.040,So there are actually a lot of scientists who study this condition.,2018-10-24
00:02:03.040,00:02:07.060,and I'm flying to Cincinnati to Head &amp; Shoulders headquarters to visit their lab,2018-10-24
00:02:08.960,00:02:09.800,Okay.,2018-10-24
00:02:10.560,00:02:12.060,Do you need a break or something?,2018-10-24
00:02:12.060,00:02:15.200,"No, it's funny like 'cause I'm not really sure what I'm getting myself into right",2018-10-24
00:02:15.200,00:02:16.320,No. No.,2018-10-24
00:02:16.320,00:02:19.400,I am going to have my head swabbed,2018-10-24
00:02:19.400,00:02:20.880,Mm-hmm. You are,2018-10-24
00:02:20.880,00:02:24.160,"What what is that all about? I mean, this is something you do to people all the time?",2018-10-24
00:02:24.160,00:02:25.540,"Oh, yeah. Every day.",2018-10-24
00:02:25.540,00:02:29.120,--You're gonna cotton swab my scalp. --Yes,2018-10-24
00:02:29.120,00:02:32.140,And we're looking for whatï¼Ÿ,2018-10-24
00:02:32.140,00:02:39.000,So we are gonna be looking for the malassezia that is on your scalp.,2018-10-24
00:02:39.000,00:02:41.220,"Okay, so what do I need to do?",2018-10-24
00:02:41.220,00:02:44.420,So I need you to have a seat here.,2018-10-24
00:02:44.420,00:02:47.380,Let's see and I just put my head in here?,2018-10-24
00:02:47.380,00:02:52.320,"Yeah, put your head face forward. Okay. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna part your hair.",2018-10-24
00:02:52.320,00:02:58.340,So now I'm gonna take my swab I'm basically gonna grab off your scalp. Mm-hmm,2018-10-24
00:02:58.340,00:03:00.640,So then what I do is I take this,2018-10-24
00:03:00.640,00:03:05.360,These are sticky plates here that I can plate the malassezia on,2018-10-24
00:03:05.360,00:03:07.400,and what I can do is I can add a stain,2018-10-24
00:03:07.400,00:03:14.300,throw this under the microscope and this is the individual cells of malassezia here.,2018-10-24
00:03:14.300,00:03:18.380,Malassezia globosa is a fungus that lives on your scalp,2018-10-24
00:03:18.380,00:03:22.840,it thrives in the warm moist environment under your hair,2018-10-24
00:03:22.840,00:03:28.640,"and it is thought to be one of the causes of dandruff. So, how did my swab come back?",2018-10-24
00:03:28.640,00:03:32.120,"Well, I have malassezia living on my head.",2018-10-24
00:03:32.120,00:03:36.420,This is actually what the fungus looks like. This is a lawn of the Malassezia globosa fungi.,2018-10-24
00:03:36.420,00:03:38.100,You say a lawn. It's a lawn.,2018-10-24
00:03:38.100,00:03:41.780,So basically you can see those little dots they're all individual colonies,2018-10-24
00:03:41.780,00:03:46.640,"and when they grow really close together like that, that's a lawn, Kind of like a bunch of grass",2018-10-24
00:03:49.180,00:03:52.900,Now that I'm close to and actually smell it it smells like bread,2018-10-24
00:03:52.900,00:03:54.780,"Yeah, well, you know, it's a yeast",2018-10-24
00:03:54.780,00:04:00.400," You know it's a free, living fungus just like the Saccharomyces that are used to make bread and make beer with",2018-10-24
00:04:00.400,00:04:01.780,"So, could you make bread with this?",2018-10-24
00:04:01.780,00:04:07.540,Uh.. No. I wouldn't want to make bread with the yeast off of your scalp. Not right now.,2018-10-24
00:04:07.940,00:04:11.420,-- Have you been tested? -- I've been tested. Yes. -- And what did it come out to?,2018-10-24
00:04:11.420,00:04:15.420,I have a decent amount. So... But we all do. So...,2018-10-24
00:04:15.420,00:04:16.360,It's on everyone's head.,2018-10-24
00:04:16.360,00:04:19.400,It's on everyone's head as long as you have hair. --Right,2018-10-24
00:04:19.900,00:04:24.560,"But if everyone has Malassezia, why do only half of us get dandruff?",2018-10-24
00:04:24.560,00:04:29.520,Well Malassezia lives on the oils called sebum secreted by your skin,2018-10-24
00:04:29.520,00:04:34.540,The fungi release enzymes called lipases that break down fat molecules,2018-10-24
00:04:34.540,00:04:38.320,"Oh, so this is one of the lipases that Malassezia produces",2018-10-24
00:04:38.320,00:04:42.120,So this is something that Malassezia uses to get food,2018-10-24
00:04:42.120,00:04:45.840,But unfortunately as a byproduct of that it also attacks your scalp,2018-10-24
00:04:45.840,00:04:49.840,because it produces free fatty acids that irritate the scalp,2018-10-24
00:04:49.840,00:04:54.400,for some of us those molecules are perceived as invaders if you will,2018-10-24
00:04:54.400,00:05:01.360,and all the defensive forces that we have will get turned on to repel essentially these invading molecules,2018-10-24
00:05:01.360,00:05:05.740,and those defensive forces end up causing this collateral damage,2018-10-24
00:05:05.740,00:05:08.660,that we interpret as an unhealthy scalp and dandruff,2018-10-24
00:05:09.020,00:05:13.020,One of the scalps defenses is to speed up the turnover of skin cells,2018-10-24
00:05:13.020,00:05:19.180,So instead of taking a month for skin cells to mature and reach the surface they take as little as seven days,2018-10-24
00:05:19.180,00:05:23.800,When you know they get to the surface the adhesive function from one cell to the other hasn't been lost,2018-10-24
00:05:23.800,00:05:29.580,"And so they shed as these clumps of skin cells three or four hundred together, which we see as a dandruff flake",2018-10-24
00:05:30.960,00:05:36.820,the dandruff flakes are just an indicator of a fundamentally unhealthy scalp underlying it,2018-10-24
00:05:36.820,00:05:39.980,by any measure you can dream of making,2018-10-24
00:05:39.980,00:05:44.760,Dandruff skin samples show elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines,2018-10-24
00:05:44.760,00:05:49.840,"Histamines which cause itching, and blood proteins on the surface of the scalp",2018-10-24
00:05:49.840,00:05:55.980,Indicating that the skin is not acting as a good barrier between your insides and the outside world,2018-10-24
00:05:55.980,00:06:00.380,But it goes even further than that down to the level of gene expression,2018-10-24
00:06:00.380,00:06:06.520,Scientists took swabs from healthy scalps and dandruff scalps and then they extracted the RNA,2018-10-24
00:06:06.520,00:06:11.360,Effectively markers of which genes are being expressed and how strongly,2018-10-24
00:06:11.360,00:06:13.280,and then they compared the two groups,2018-10-24
00:06:13.280,00:06:18.140,and they found that there were nearly 4000 genes which were systematically,2018-10-24
00:06:18.140,00:06:23.500,either up-regulated or down-regulated in the dandruff scalps  compared to the healthy scalps,2018-10-24
00:06:23.500,00:06:27.340,"for example immune and inflammatory response genes were up-regulated,",2018-10-24
00:06:27.340,00:06:31.420,things like lipid metabolism were down regulated and it all kind of makes sense,2018-10-24
00:06:31.420,00:06:35.280,"But now that you know that there's a difference at the level of gene expression,",2018-10-24
00:06:35.280,00:06:37.960,How do you actually treat dandruff?,2018-10-24
00:06:37.960,00:06:41.220,So this is the the lawn of Malassezia.,2018-10-24
00:06:41.220,00:06:46.360,This is the Malassezia with a spot of the Head &amp; Shoulders active put on it,2018-10-24
00:06:46.360,00:06:51.280,The Malassezia just doesn't grow where that Head &amp; Shoulders active actually is,2018-10-24
00:06:51.280,00:06:56.900,"These active ingredients can be zinc pyrithione, selenium sulfide, or piroctone olamine.",2018-10-24
00:06:56.900,00:07:03.780,They are controlling the metabolism of those Malassezia cells that are leading to irritating substances,2018-10-24
00:07:03.780,00:07:07.200,so the idea is to suppress their bio activity to some extent,2018-10-24
00:07:07.200,00:07:10.920,so that we're reducing the level of irritating substances on our scalp,2018-10-24
00:07:10.920,00:07:15.980,that trigger the irritation and hyperproliferation and buried destruction that we talked about,2018-10-24
00:07:15.980,00:07:20.840,now that we understand like these clusters in these genes signatures of dandruff is,2018-10-24
00:07:20.840,00:07:24.040,Can we reverse these gene signatures if we treat with Head &amp; Shoulders?,2018-10-24
00:07:24.040,00:07:28.480,So this is the group of dandruff at baseline and these genes are all down-regulated,2018-10-24
00:07:28.480,00:07:30.280,and then these genes are up-regulated,2018-10-24
00:07:30.280,00:07:35.980,You can see if you treat with just a cosmetic shampoo that you really don't make a difference in those genes,2018-10-24
00:07:35.980,00:07:38.900,But if you treat with Head &amp; Shoulders after three weeks,2018-10-24
00:07:38.900,00:07:43.060,This signature looks just like somebody who doesn't have dandruff.,2018-10-24
00:07:43.060,00:07:47.740,"And so you're looking at 3,700 genes have all clustered all on here,",2018-10-24
00:07:47.740,00:07:52.820,And you're seeing them flip around. They're going from an unhealthy signature to a healthy signature,2018-10-24
00:07:52.820,00:07:56.640,"So Head &amp; Shoulders reduces the Malassezia irritants on the scalp,",2018-10-24
00:07:56.640,00:08:00.880,"changing your scalpâ€˜s response, and ultimately reducing skin flakes",2018-10-24
00:08:00.880,00:08:04.200,"So unlike dinosaurs, we don't have to live with dandruff",2018-10-24
00:08:04.980,00:08:10.740,But in their case the presence of skin flakes reveals something important about their biology,2018-10-24
00:08:10.740,00:08:16.260,They had evolved warm-bloodedness and hence feathers as a way to keep warm,2018-10-24
00:08:16.260,00:08:23.140,But once they had feathers skin could no longer be shed in one piece like a snake but instead in tiny pieces,2018-10-24
00:08:23.140,00:08:30.100,"So in fact, although it's an amusing discovery it actually had quite an important or profound point",2018-10-24
00:08:30.100,00:08:34.580,because it tells us that dinosaurs while commonly called reptiles,2018-10-24
00:08:34.580,00:08:40.000,are on the side of the birds and the mammals in terms of physiology. They were definitely warm-blooded,2018-10-24
00:08:42.700,00:08:47.160,"Hey, I hope you learned something from watching this video I certainly learned a lot making it.",2018-10-24
00:08:47.160,00:08:51.100,and if you want to find out more about Head &amp; Shoulders research or about how to get rid of dandruff,2018-10-24
00:08:51.100,00:08:53.790,I will put a link to their website down in the description,2018-10-24
00:08:53.790,00:08:57.940,so I want to say a big thanks to Head &amp; Shoulders for supporting this episode of Veritasium,2018-10-24
00:08:57.940,00:09:01.220,"and I want to thank you for washing. Or, watching",2018-10-24
