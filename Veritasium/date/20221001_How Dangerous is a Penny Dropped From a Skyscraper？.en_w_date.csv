00:07:57.480,00:08:01.200,the increasing air density reduced his terminal velocity,2022-10-01

00:08:18.540,00:08:21.450,was to see water floating.,2022-10-01

00:08:32.430,00:08:34.140,you can experience what it would be like,2022-10-01

00:08:36.543,00:08:38.960,(soft music),2022-10-01
00:08:42.390,00:08:44.340,They have a low terminal velocity,2022-10-01
00:08:44.340,00:08:46.767,of just 25 kilometers per hour,2022-10-01
00:08:46.767,00:08:48.690,and that's what the wind speed was set to,2022-10-01

00:08:50.430,00:08:51.960,And what you can see,2022-10-01
00:08:51.960,00:08:56.070,is that raindrops aren't shaped like cartoon raindrops.,2022-10-01
00:08:56.070,00:08:58.320,"They are closer to spherical,",2022-10-01
00:08:58.320,00:09:00.300,but a bit flatter on the bottom,2022-10-01

00:09:17.564,00:09:19.620,(hail hitting the ground),2022-10-01
00:09:19.620,00:09:22.320,- [Man] I just completely lost my windshield right here.,2022-10-01
00:09:22.320,00:09:23.700,"- [Derek] Every year in the US,",2022-10-01
00:09:23.700,00:09:25.890,hail injures around 20 people,2022-10-01
00:09:25.890,00:09:29.310,and since 2000 it's caused four fatalities.,2022-10-01
00:09:29.310,00:09:31.590,That's because hail can reach terminal velocities,2022-10-01
00:09:31.590,00:09:34.440,of over 200 kilometers per hour.,2022-10-01
00:09:34.440,00:09:37.980,That's around 10 times the terminal velocity of rain.,2022-10-01
00:09:37.980,00:09:41.520,But why is its terminal velocity so much higher,2022-10-01
00:09:41.520,00:09:44.280,even though ice itself is slightly less dense,2022-10-01
00:09:44.280,00:09:46.050,than liquid water?,2022-10-01
00:09:46.050,00:09:48.660,The main thing is that hail can get much bigger,2022-10-01
00:09:48.660,00:09:49.800,than a raindrop.,2022-10-01
00:09:49.800,00:09:52.560,Hailstones have been measured up to 20 centimeters,2022-10-01

00:10:03.540,00:10:05.460,"So the bigger the hailstone,",2022-10-01
00:10:05.460,00:10:08.040,the faster its terminal velocity.,2022-10-01
00:10:08.040,00:10:09.660,"It also has more mass,",2022-10-01
00:10:09.660,00:10:12.090,so it carries even more kinetic energy,2022-10-01
00:10:12.090,00:10:14.490,and packs a bigger punch when it hits something.,2022-10-01
00:10:15.930,00:10:17.442,Pennies reach terminal velocity after falling,2022-10-01
00:10:17.442,00:10:20.250,only around 15 meters.,2022-10-01
00:10:20.250,00:10:22.800,You can see in this shot the average speed of the pennies,2022-10-01
00:10:22.800,00:10:23.970,in the top of the frame,2022-10-01
00:10:23.970,00:10:26.850,is the same as at the bottom of the frame.,2022-10-01
00:10:26.850,00:10:28.260,They aren't speeding up.,2022-10-01
00:10:28.260,00:10:30.690,They've reached terminal velocity.,2022-10-01
00:10:30.690,00:10:32.970,So it wouldn't matter if pennies were dropped on you,2022-10-01
00:10:32.970,00:10:37.110,"from 15 meters or 300 meters or 3000 meters,",2022-10-01
00:10:37.110,00:10:38.760,it would feel the same,2022-10-01
00:10:38.760,00:10:41.790,because they would be going the same speed.,2022-10-01
00:10:41.790,00:10:43.890,"In fact, we didn't take the helicopter",2022-10-01
00:10:43.890,00:10:46.110,all the way up to Empire State Building height,2022-10-01
00:10:46.110,00:10:48.150,because that wouldn't have increased,2022-10-01
00:10:48.150,00:10:49.890,the speed of the pennies at all,2022-10-01
00:10:49.890,00:10:52.770,and it would've just made aiming much harder.,2022-10-01
00:10:52.770,00:10:54.990,"- By the end, I'm throwing to account",2022-10-01

00:10:56.970,00:10:59.340,that's moving between you and the helicopter.,2022-10-01
00:10:59.340,00:11:02.220,And so the pennies are making this like 12 foot arc,2022-10-01
00:11:02.220,00:11:04.353,all the way over and then coming back.,2022-10-01
00:11:07.680,00:11:10.320,- [Derek] One of the reasons pennies are so hard to aim,2022-10-01
00:11:10.320,00:11:13.680,is because they flutter and tumble as they fall.,2022-10-01
00:11:13.680,00:11:17.520,This tumbling behavior means pennies don't actually have,2022-10-01
00:11:17.520,00:11:19.513,a single terminal velocity.,2022-10-01
00:11:19.513,00:11:22.350,- A penny actually has two terminal velocities,2022-10-01
00:11:22.350,00:11:23.490,and it oscillates between them.,2022-10-01
00:11:23.490,00:11:26.400,So it's got one on its face and one on its edge.,2022-10-01
00:11:26.400,00:11:27.870,I've got a wind tunnel that can show you,2022-10-01
00:11:27.870,00:11:28.950,exactly how that works.,2022-10-01
00:11:28.950,00:11:29.970,It's really beautiful.,2022-10-01
00:11:29.970,00:11:30.803,- [Derek] I gotta see that.,2022-10-01
00:11:30.803,00:11:31.680,"- Yeah, it's really neat.",2022-10-01

00:11:34.500,00:11:36.300,- [Derek] Adam built a custom wind tunnel,2022-10-01
00:11:36.300,00:11:38.190,to witness this for himself.,2022-10-01
00:11:38.190,00:11:41.910,So I went to San Francisco to his cave to check it out.,2022-10-01

00:11:57.030,00:11:57.930,you know? - Yeah.,2022-10-01
00:11:57.930,00:12:00.113,- Who weren't alive when you were making this.,2022-10-01
00:12:01.110,00:12:04.080,"- [Derek] Because of the holes which allow air to escape,",2022-10-01
00:12:04.080,00:12:06.870,this wind tunnel has a gradient of wind speeds,2022-10-01

00:12:15.960,00:12:19.590,and that back pressure is relieved by these holes enough,2022-10-01
00:12:19.590,00:12:21.000,so that the penny spins.,2022-10-01
00:12:21.000,00:12:22.410,- [Derek] If a penny really has,2022-10-01
00:12:22.410,00:12:24.120,"two different terminal velocities,",2022-10-01
00:12:24.120,00:12:26.850,it should oscillate up and down in this wind tunnel,2022-10-01
00:12:26.850,00:12:27.683,as a result.,2022-10-01
00:12:27.683,00:12:29.050,- There you go.,2022-10-01
00:12:29.050,00:12:32.364,(sound of air rushing by),2022-10-01
00:12:32.364,00:12:34.394,"- That's amazing to see it oscillate, right?",2022-10-01
00:12:34.394,00:12:35.280,- I know.,2022-10-01
00:12:35.280,00:12:36.510,The fact that it goes up and down,2022-10-01
00:12:36.510,00:12:38.091,and then comes back up again.,2022-10-01
00:12:38.091,00:12:39.476,- Yeah. - Oh yeah.,2022-10-01
00:12:39.476,00:12:43.803,- It was just hanging out like that.,2022-10-01
00:12:44.640,00:12:47.400,- When in 2003 I dropped the penny on the top,2022-10-01
00:12:47.400,00:12:50.550,"and it went up and down, like I'm still,",2022-10-01

00:13:01.050,00:13:02.913,So check it out after this.,2022-10-01
00:13:03.810,00:13:05.700,So the reason pennies aren't dangerous,2022-10-01
00:13:05.700,00:13:08.010,is because their terminal velocity is at most,2022-10-01
00:13:08.010,00:13:10.740,about 80 kilometers per hour.,2022-10-01
00:13:10.740,00:13:11.730,"Yeah, it's not gonna hurt you.",2022-10-01
00:13:11.730,00:13:13.429,- That's busted. - Right.,2022-10-01
00:13:13.429,00:13:15.366,(both laughing),2022-10-01
00:13:15.366,00:13:16.560,- Think I'm allowed to say like.,2022-10-01
00:13:16.560,00:13:17.509,- Like old habit.,2022-10-01
00:13:17.509,00:13:18.870,(both laughing),2022-10-01
00:13:18.870,00:13:20.970,But something more aerodynamic,2022-10-01
00:13:20.970,00:13:23.370,would have a higher terminal velocity.,2022-10-01
00:13:23.370,00:13:26.580,And this has led some to suggest ballpoint pens,2022-10-01
00:13:26.580,00:13:29.640,falling from a skyscraper like the Empire State Building,2022-10-01
00:13:29.640,00:13:30.930,could be lethal.,2022-10-01
00:13:30.930,00:13:31.920,- But supposedly.,2022-10-01
00:13:31.920,00:13:33.720,"- Yeah, a pen, a ballpoint pen.",2022-10-01
00:13:33.720,00:13:36.760,- Is as dangerous as a penny is mythically dangerous?,2022-10-01

00:13:37.860,00:13:39.780,Is meant to actually be lethal.,2022-10-01
00:13:39.780,00:13:41.493,- It's worth really trying.,2022-10-01
00:13:44.100,00:13:47.160,- [Derek] These pens weigh about twice as much as a penny,2022-10-01
00:13:47.160,00:13:49.953,and they have a smaller cross-sectional area.,2022-10-01
00:13:51.390,00:13:53.910,"- All right, I'm gonna start the first drop.",2022-10-01
00:13:53.910,00:13:57.000,"- [Derek] So this will increase the ratio of weight to drag,",2022-10-01
