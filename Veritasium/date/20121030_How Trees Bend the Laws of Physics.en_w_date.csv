00:00:05.970,00:00:10.950,Like how can trees be so tall? It's a question that doesn't even seem,2012-10-30
00:00:10.950,00:00:11.730,like it needs an answer.,2012-10-30
00:00:11.730,00:00:15.330,Trees just are tall. Some of them are over 100 meters.,2012-10-30
00:00:15.330,00:00:17.050,Why should there be a height limit?,2012-10-30
00:00:17.050,00:00:21.800,I'll tell you why. Tress need to transport water from their roots up into their topmost,2012-10-30

00:01:15.110,00:01:20.860,The tree effectively has valves in it. So you don't have a column of water,2012-10-30

00:01:34.030,00:01:38.620,water column. So how else could the tree transport water from the roots to the leaves?,2012-10-30
00:01:38.620,00:01:40.700,"They don't suck, they don't use a vacuum.",2012-10-30

00:01:53.490,00:01:57.570,What about osmotic pressure? If there is more solute in the roots than in the surrounding,2012-10-30
00:01:57.570,00:02:02.350,"soil, water would be pushed up the tree. But some trees live in mangroves, where the water",2012-10-30
00:02:02.350,00:02:06.840,is so salty that osmotic pressure actually acts in the other direction so the tree needs,2012-10-30

00:02:22.310,00:02:24.630,So how do trees do it?,2012-10-30
00:02:24.630,00:02:29.410,Well one of the assumptions we made is wrong: The lowest the pressure can go is a pure vacuum,2012-10-30
