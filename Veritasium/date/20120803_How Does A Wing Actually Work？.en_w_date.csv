00:00:01.450,00:00:07.059,I've snuck into minutephysics' studio to explain how a wing actually works,2012-08-03
00:00:07.059,00:00:10.200,"Hang on, something doesn't feel right.",2012-08-03
00:00:10.200,00:00:13.120,"Ah, that's better.",2012-08-03
00:00:13.120,00:00:17.590,Now everyone knows that a wing generates lift due to its characteristic shape,2012-08-03
00:00:17.590,00:00:22.040,"Since air travels farther over top of the wing, it must go faster than the air underneath",2012-08-03
00:00:22.040,00:00:26.000,so that both streams meet up simultaneously at the trailing edge,2012-08-03
00:00:26.000,00:00:30.230,"And according to Bernoulli's principle, faster flowing air exerts less pressure than the",2012-08-03
00:00:30.230,00:00:33.890,slower air beneath the wing This pressure difference creates an upward,2012-08-03
00:00:33.890,00:00:35.620,force -- lift.,2012-08-03
00:00:35.620,00:00:36.710,Job done.,2012-08-03
00:00:36.710,00:00:37.710,Right?,2012-08-03
00:00:37.710,00:00:40.620,Nope This simple explanation taught in many textbooks,2012-08-03
00:00:40.620,00:00:45.430,and classrooms has obvious problems Like how could a plane fly upside down?,2012-08-03
00:00:45.430,00:00:48.810,Some planes like the Wright brothers' had nearly flat wings.,2012-08-03
00:00:48.810,00:00:53.130,So presumably air would travel the same speed over both sides and there would be no lift,2012-08-03
00:00:53.130,00:00:57.290,Plus experiments show that air streams don't meet up at the back of the wing.,2012-08-03
00:00:57.290,00:01:01.250,"Air over the top goes significantly faster, reaching the trailing edge first.",2012-08-03
00:01:01.250,00:01:04.559,So how does a wing actually generate lift?,2012-08-03
00:01:04.559,00:01:07.710,Well the key is the wing must deflect air downwards,2012-08-03
00:01:07.710,00:01:11.210,This can be achieved using asymmetric or cambered air foils,2012-08-03
00:01:11.210,00:01:15.819,Or by increasing the angle of attack Air under the wing is deflected down,2012-08-03
00:01:15.819,00:01:19.399,And by the coanda effect air above the wing is guided along its surface,2012-08-03
00:01:19.399,00:01:23.090,and down as well Since the air is slowed and deflected down,2012-08-03
00:01:23.090,00:01:26.459,"by the wing, it pushes the wing up and back.",2012-08-03
00:01:26.459,00:01:28.469,"Lift, and drag.",2012-08-03
00:01:28.469,00:01:30.939,This is in accordance with Newton's Third Law of Motion,2012-08-03
00:01:30.939,00:01:36.310,"But hang on, if you can explain lift only using the deflection of air and Newton's laws,",2012-08-03
00:01:36.310,00:01:38.509,then the Bernoulli explanation must be completely wrong,2012-08-03
00:01:38.509,00:01:42.859,"Well, no, air over the top of the wing does go faster",2012-08-03
00:01:42.859,00:01:45.590,"than air beneath, creating a pressure difference that generates lift",2012-08-03
00:01:45.590,00:01:51.229,Then this Newtonian explanation is unnecessary rubbish and the original explanation was right!,2012-08-03
00:01:51.229,00:01:52.329,That's not true either.,2012-08-03
00:01:52.329,00:01:57.380,The original explanation incorrectly assumed that air over and under the wing must reconnect,2012-08-03
00:01:57.380,00:02:01.040,"at the trailing edge, and there was no mention of deflecting air down.",2012-08-03
00:02:01.040,00:02:05.999,"Each explanation, done correctly, completely accounts for the lift generated by a wing.",2012-08-03
00:02:05.999,00:02:08.840,They're just two different ways of looking at the same thing.,2012-08-03
00:02:08.840,00:02:13.349,"So next time someone brings up the standard misconception, you can tell them that explanation",2012-08-03
00:02:13.349,00:02:16.760,just doesn't fly.,2012-08-03
00:02:16.760,00:02:19.250,"And if you liked that, you've gotta check out MinutePhysics.",2012-08-03
00:02:19.250,00:02:22.739,I've got total respect for a guy who does this every week.,2012-08-03
