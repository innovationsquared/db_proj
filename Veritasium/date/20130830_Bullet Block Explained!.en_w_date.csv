00:00:00.120,00:00:06.060,In my last video we performed an experiment in which two identical wood blocks were shot,2013-08-30
00:00:06.060,00:00:09.990,"with the same rifle, one through the center of mass and the other one slightly off to",2013-08-30
00:00:09.990,00:00:10.990,one side.,2013-08-30
00:00:10.990,00:00:14.420,"Now if you haven’t seen that video yet, then click here now and go and watch it.",2013-08-30
00:00:14.420,00:00:20.720,"Or, if you are on a mobile device, click the link in the description.",2013-08-30
00:00:20.720,00:00:24.780,"So the question was: Compared to the block shot straight through its center, how high",2013-08-30
00:00:24.780,00:00:27.190,would the block shot to one side go?,2013-08-30
00:00:27.190,00:00:31.480,Now 60 percent of you predicted that it wouldn’t go as high.,2013-08-30
00:00:31.480,00:00:34.969,&gt;&gt; It didn’t seem as high.,2013-08-30
00:00:34.969,00:00:37.309,&gt;&gt; Now check out the high speed footage.,2013-08-30
00:00:37.309,00:00:39.290,"&gt;&gt; Oh, no.",2013-08-30
00:00:39.290,00:00:40.929,&gt;&gt; You can clearly see that both blocks...,2013-08-30
00:00:40.929,00:00:41.929,&gt;&gt; What?,2013-08-30
00:00:41.929,00:00:43.139,&gt;&gt; ... go to the exact same height.,2013-08-30
00:00:43.139,00:00:44.190,"&gt;&gt; Oh, come on.",2013-08-30
00:00:44.190,00:00:46.839,&gt;&gt; Nineteen percent said that it would go higher.,2013-08-30
00:00:46.839,00:00:52.569,And only 21 percent correctly predicted that both blocks would go to the exact same height.,2013-08-30
00:00:52.569,00:00:56.859,So most of us got it wrong the first time around and that includes Henry and me and,2013-08-30
00:00:56.859,00:00:59.029,Destin who has a lot of experience with this stuff.,2013-08-30
00:00:59.029,00:01:02.639,"&gt;&gt; I mean, I can’t tell you how many times I have hit wood with a rifle.",2013-08-30
00:01:02.639,00:01:06.500,&gt;&gt; So even experienced and intelligent people get it wrong sometimes.,2013-08-30
00:01:06.500,00:01:10.640,"In this case I think the result was particularly counter intuitive, because the spinning block",2013-08-30
00:01:10.640,00:01:13.890,clearly ended up with more energy than the other block.,2013-08-30
00:01:13.890,00:01:17.560,So I asked you guys to make me a video response and explain what is happening.,2013-08-30
00:01:17.560,00:01:19.400,And this is what I received.,2013-08-30
00:01:19.400,00:01:29.230,"&gt;&gt; If you imagine the bullet traveling through the center of the block, then...",2013-08-30
00:01:29.230,00:01:35.750,[multiple voices],2013-08-30
00:01:35.750,00:01:39.000,&gt;&gt; Whoa.,2013-08-30
00:01:39.000,00:01:40.740,That is a lot of video responses.,2013-08-30
00:01:40.740,00:01:42.250,And that is not even all of them.,2013-08-30
00:01:42.250,00:01:47.430,I have got to say I was blown away by all of the great video responses I received.,2013-08-30
00:01:47.430,00:01:51.850,"You guys are awesome and really, really appreciate all the effort you went to.",2013-08-30
00:01:51.850,00:01:57.590,"You know, some of you actually replicated the experiment, perhaps with different setups.",2013-08-30
00:01:57.590,00:01:59.630,"&gt;&gt; Oh, ah.",2013-08-30
00:01:59.630,00:02:04.090,"&gt;&gt; The experiment was featured on blog posts, including Scientific America and Wired.",2013-08-30
00:02:04.090,00:02:06.530,There is an interactive simulation you can try.,2013-08-30
00:02:06.530,00:02:07.750,Link is in the description.,2013-08-30
00:02:07.750,00:02:09.729,And someone even made a web comic.,2013-08-30
00:02:09.729,00:02:13.239,"It is so incredible, you know, watching all of those video responses.",2013-08-30
00:02:13.239,00:02:14.950,And I did watch all of them.,2013-08-30
00:02:14.950,00:02:20.569,"That was my proudest moment making this YouTube channel, seeing all of you guys doing science",2013-08-30
00:02:20.569,00:02:23.340,and getting so involved and putting in so much effort.,2013-08-30
00:02:23.340,00:02:24.560,It just blows my mind.,2013-08-30
00:02:24.560,00:02:25.560,It is amazing.,2013-08-30
00:02:25.560,00:02:27.250,Thank you guys so much.,2013-08-30
00:02:27.250,00:02:28.250,"Thank you, thank you.",2013-08-30
00:02:28.250,00:02:31.659,I can’t even put it into words how awesome it is.,2013-08-30
00:02:31.659,00:02:33.019,Whoo.,2013-08-30
00:02:33.019,00:02:34.629,So what is the answer?,2013-08-30
00:02:34.629,00:02:39.030,How could two identical blocks shot with the same rifle end up with different amounts of,2013-08-30
00:02:39.030,00:02:40.030,energy?,2013-08-30
00:02:40.030,00:02:44.390,"Well, some of you felt that the amount of rotational energy would be basically insignificant.",2013-08-30
00:02:44.390,00:02:51.180,&gt;&gt; What if the amount of energy necessary to get that very small block rotating really,2013-08-30
00:02:51.180,00:02:57.140,is negligible in comparison to the amount of energy necessary to lift it into the air,2013-08-30
00:02:57.140,00:02:58.140,and resist gravity?,2013-08-30
00:02:58.140,00:03:02.909,"&gt;&gt; Well, we can calculate it, because the spinning block was rotating at about 11 times",2013-08-30
00:03:02.909,00:03:03.940,per second.,2013-08-30
00:03:03.940,00:03:09.330,So you can calculate that its rotational energy would be equal to 50 percent of the gravitational,2013-08-30
00:03:09.330,00:03:12.209,potential energy when those blocks were at their peak.,2013-08-30
00:03:12.209,00:03:17.650,So the spinning block actually had 1.5 times the energy of the non-rotating block.,2013-08-30
00:03:17.650,00:03:20.090,And in my books that is not negligible.,2013-08-30
00:03:20.090,00:03:22.370,So what else could be causing this?,2013-08-30
00:03:22.370,00:03:26.750,"Well, some of you actually measured the height difference using pixel counters and found",2013-08-30
00:03:26.750,00:03:30.230,that the blocks didn't go to exactly the same height.,2013-08-30
00:03:30.230,00:03:33.799,"So this raises an important question, which is: How different would those heights have",2013-08-30
00:03:33.799,00:03:37.530,to be before you can think that there really is a difference there?,2013-08-30
00:03:37.530,00:03:41.799,"Well, given that the rotational energy is about 50 percent of the gravitational potential",2013-08-30
00:03:41.799,00:03:45.180,"energy, you might expect the spinning block to go half as high.",2013-08-30
00:03:45.180,00:03:48.950,But looking at the video footage you can clearly see it doesn’t go half as high.,2013-08-30
00:03:48.950,00:03:51.609,It goes basically to the same height.,2013-08-30
00:03:51.609,00:03:55.309,"To know for sure, you would probably want to do the experiment a number of times.",2013-08-30
00:03:55.309,00:03:58.969,"In science you have got to repeat things and make sure what you saw is not just a fluke,",2013-08-30
00:03:58.969,00:04:00.809,that it will happen every time.,2013-08-30
00:04:00.809,00:04:05.400,"So, in fact, we did repeat the experiment a number of times and here are all of the",2013-08-30
00:04:05.400,00:04:14.639,blocks lined up side by side so you can compare their heights.,2013-08-30
00:04:14.639,00:04:17.780,The blocks clearly do not all go to the same height.,2013-08-30
00:04:17.780,00:04:20.259,"So you might say: Derek, you were tricking us.",2013-08-30
00:04:20.259,00:04:22.699,You just picked the two that went the closest and used those.,2013-08-30
00:04:22.699,00:04:23.699,It is true.,2013-08-30
00:04:23.699,00:04:24.699,I did do that.,2013-08-30
00:04:24.699,00:04:28.849,But the point is do the spinning blocks go systematically to a lower height than the,2013-08-30
00:04:28.849,00:04:29.919,non-spinning blocks?,2013-08-30
00:04:29.919,00:04:33.860,And I think from the video footage the answer is clearly no.,2013-08-30
00:04:33.860,00:04:35.560,So why not?,2013-08-30
00:04:35.560,00:04:40.840,"Well, another common response I saw was that air resistance must play a role, that the",2013-08-30
00:04:40.840,00:04:46.030,spinning block exposes a small surface area as it is traveling upwards and this means,2013-08-30
00:04:46.030,00:04:48.050,there is less air resistance impeding it.,2013-08-30
00:04:48.050,00:04:52.830,So even with a lower velocity it could make it to the same height as the non-spinning,2013-08-30
00:04:52.830,00:04:53.830,block.,2013-08-30
00:04:53.830,00:04:57.259,"But you can do the calculation and find that the difference in air resistance would be,",2013-08-30
00:04:57.259,00:05:01.169,"at most, about 0.6 percent of the weight of the block.",2013-08-30
00:05:01.169,00:05:03.560,"In other words, negligible.",2013-08-30
00:05:03.560,00:05:06.139,So what is the real answer?,2013-08-30
00:05:06.139,00:05:10.530,"Well, there are a number of ways of approaching the problem and I saw you guys try almost",2013-08-30
00:05:10.530,00:05:14.500,"all of them: force, torque, momentum, energy.",2013-08-30
00:05:14.500,00:05:18.120,But the easiest one of these is the law of conservation of momentum.,2013-08-30
00:05:18.120,00:05:22.470,"You see, when the bullet is fired out of the rifle it has a certain amount of momentum",2013-08-30
00:05:22.470,00:05:24.970,entirely in the vertical direction.,2013-08-30
00:05:24.970,00:05:29.520,And when the bullet becomes lodged in the block the bullet and block together must have,2013-08-30
00:05:29.520,00:05:32.009,that same momentum that the bullet had.,2013-08-30
00:05:32.009,00:05:36.410,"Now it doesn’t matter where on the block the bullet hits, because the bullet had a",2013-08-30
00:05:36.410,00:05:38.240,certain momentum before it hit the block.,2013-08-30
00:05:38.240,00:05:42.539,The block and bullet together afterwards must have that amount of momentum upwards.,2013-08-30
00:05:42.539,00:05:46.699,"So this means regardless of whether the block is spinning or not, it must have the same",2013-08-30
00:05:46.699,00:05:52.120,"upwards velocity, so that it has the same momentum, so it will got the same height regardless",2013-08-30
00:05:52.120,00:05:54.039,of whether it is spinning or not.,2013-08-30
00:05:54.039,00:05:56.800,It is simple conservation of momentum.,2013-08-30
00:05:56.800,00:05:58.939,"Momentum is always, always conserved.",2013-08-30
00:05:58.939,00:06:01.210,It is something you can always rely on.,2013-08-30
00:06:01.210,00:06:03.289,And it is why you should think about it first.,2013-08-30
00:06:03.289,00:06:07.569,"But some of you may say: Ok, well, there is also angular momentum in the spinning block.",2013-08-30
00:06:07.569,00:06:12.240,But the point is: Angular moment and linear momentum are independent and they are conserved,2013-08-30
00:06:12.240,00:06:13.240,independently.,2013-08-30
00:06:13.240,00:06:17.300,So you can simply think about the upward momentum of the bullet and that is going to have to,2013-08-30
00:06:17.300,00:06:21.139,"be the upward momentum of those two blocks and it doesn’t matter that one is spinning,",2013-08-30
00:06:21.139,00:06:24.330,because they have the same total linear momentum upwards.,2013-08-30
00:06:24.330,00:06:26.410,So they have to go to the same height.,2013-08-30
00:06:26.410,00:06:31.669,"But if that is the case, why does the spinning block end up with this extra rotational energy?",2013-08-30
00:06:31.669,00:06:35.550,"Well, the thing about energy is it is a little bit tricky.",2013-08-30
00:06:35.550,00:06:40.580,"Although total energy is conserved, the energy of motion—which is called kinetic energy—is",2013-08-30
00:06:40.580,00:06:41.990,not conserved.,2013-08-30
00:06:41.990,00:06:47.490,"So what happens is as the bullet strikes the wood a lot of its kinetic energy is lost,",2013-08-30
00:06:47.490,00:06:51.560,"heating up the wood, creating sound and deforming that wood block.",2013-08-30
00:06:51.560,00:06:55.669,"So it would be possible for the rotating block to end up with more energy of motion, more",2013-08-30
00:06:55.669,00:07:02.370,"kinetic energy, if the bullet loses less energy deforming the wood and heating it up and creating",2013-08-30
00:07:02.370,00:07:03.870,that sound.,2013-08-30
00:07:03.870,00:07:08.180,"And this kind of makes a little bit of intuitive sense, because if you imagine the bullet entering",2013-08-30
00:07:08.180,00:07:14.039,"the block on the side, the block will be moving away from it faster, because it is rotating.",2013-08-30
00:07:14.039,00:07:17.871,So that may mean that the bullet doesn’t penetrate in as far and so it wouldn’t lose,2013-08-30
00:07:17.871,00:07:22.580,"as much energy as it is entering the wood, which explains why the block has extra energy",2013-08-30
00:07:22.580,00:07:25.909,allowing it to rotate and go the same height as the other block.,2013-08-30
00:07:25.909,00:07:29.860,Let’s have a look at how far in the bullet went into each block.,2013-08-30
00:07:29.860,00:07:30.860,This is our first test.,2013-08-30
00:07:30.860,00:07:32.159,Here we go.,2013-08-30
00:07:32.159,00:07:33.479,This is the one where it went straight in.,2013-08-30
00:07:33.479,00:07:35.409,&gt;&gt; There.,2013-08-30
00:07:35.409,00:07:37.339,&gt;&gt; Yeah.,2013-08-30
00:07:37.339,00:07:39.810,&gt;&gt; And we come over here to the opposite end.,2013-08-30
00:07:39.810,00:07:41.539,&gt;&gt; This is where the bullet went in off center.,2013-08-30
00:07:41.539,00:07:43.389,&gt;&gt; It is not going in here.,2013-08-30
00:07:43.389,00:07:44.800,See where my...?,2013-08-30
00:07:44.800,00:07:47.539,"&gt;&gt; Yeah, let’s see the other one.",2013-08-30
00:07:47.539,00:07:49.069,&gt;&gt; Ok.,2013-08-30
00:07:49.069,00:07:52.349,It is all the way in.,2013-08-30
00:07:52.349,00:07:54.210,It is part way in.,2013-08-30
00:07:54.210,00:07:58.620,&gt;&gt; So the bullet didn’t go as far into the spinning block.,2013-08-30
00:07:58.620,00:07:59.720,&gt;&gt; Right.,2013-08-30
00:07:59.720,00:08:01.199,&gt;&gt; So that was pretty convincing evidence.,2013-08-30
00:08:01.199,00:08:05.270,But just to be extra sure we x-rayed both blocks and this is what we saw.,2013-08-30
00:08:05.270,00:08:10.639,I am going to overlay the blocks so we can see the difference in penetration depth.,2013-08-30
00:08:10.639,00:08:11.639,Hang on.,2013-08-30
00:08:11.639,00:08:17.430,It looks like both blocks penetrated each block to the same depth.,2013-08-30
00:08:17.430,00:08:19.550,So does that mean our theory is wrong?,2013-08-30
00:08:19.550,00:08:23.120,"Well, let’s think about how different the bullet depths should be.",2013-08-30
00:08:23.120,00:08:27.939,"I mean, when the bullet strikes the block it actually loses 97 percent of its original",2013-08-30
00:08:27.939,00:08:28.939,kinetic energy.,2013-08-30
