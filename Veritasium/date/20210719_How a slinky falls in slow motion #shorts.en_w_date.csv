00:00:00.001,00:00:01.785,If you drop a slinky,2021-07-19
00:00:01.785,00:00:03.474,"dangling under its own weight,",2021-07-19
00:00:03.474,00:00:04.926,the bottom won't start falling,2021-07-19
00:00:04.926,00:00:07.422,until the whole slinky has collapsed.,2021-07-19
00:00:07.422,00:00:08.199,This is because,2021-07-19
00:00:08.199,00:00:09.266,each coil is stretched,2021-07-19
00:00:09.266,00:00:10.153,to support the weight,2021-07-19
00:00:10.153,00:00:12.070,of everything beneath it.,2021-07-19
00:00:12.070,00:00:13.793,"So in order for one coil to fall,",2021-07-19
00:00:13.793,00:00:15.586,it needs the coil above it to collapse,2021-07-19
00:00:15.586,00:00:17.811,and so on all the way up to the top.,2021-07-19
00:00:17.811,00:00:19.257,It's like a row of dominoes,2021-07-19
00:00:19.257,00:00:21.076,where the tension released at the top,2021-07-19
00:00:21.076,00:00:22.617,cascades down the slinky,2021-07-19
00:00:22.617,00:00:24.617,and this takes some time.,2021-07-19
00:00:26.177,00:00:28.394,This is the longest slinky I had access to,2021-07-19
00:00:28.394,00:00:29.927,and what's cool about this angle,2021-07-19
00:00:29.927,00:00:32.255,is you can see the bottom starts to rotate,2021-07-19
00:00:32.255,00:00:33.546,right there.,2021-07-19
00:00:33.546,00:00:34.920,Meaning there is a twisting wave,2021-07-19
00:00:34.920,00:00:36.099,that travels through the slinky,2021-07-19
00:00:36.099,00:00:37.857,faster than the compression wave.,2021-07-19
00:00:37.857,00:00:38.853,The bottom is turning,2021-07-19
00:00:38.853,00:00:39.988,but still not falling,2021-07-19
00:00:39.988,00:00:41.641,until the top crashes into it.,2021-07-19
