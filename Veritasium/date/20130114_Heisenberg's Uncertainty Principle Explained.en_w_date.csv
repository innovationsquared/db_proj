00:00:01.560,00:00:05.520,Today I am doing an experiment that demonstrates Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle.,2013-01-14
00:00:05.520,00:00:11.330,Sao her I have a green laser and I am firing it down towards the front of the room through,2013-01-14
00:00:11.330,00:00:12.780,a narrow slit.,2013-01-14
00:00:12.780,00:00:16.920,Now that slit can be adjusted so it can be made narrower or wider.,2013-01-14
00:00:16.920,00:00:20.230,And the laser spot is projected on to a screen behind it.,2013-01-14
00:00:20.230,00:00:24.510,So what do you think is going to happen to this spot on the screen as I narrow the slit?,2013-01-14
00:00:24.510,00:00:26.730,"Well, let’s have a look.",2013-01-14
00:00:26.730,00:00:29.619,You see exactly what you would expect.,2013-01-14
00:00:29.619,00:00:31.630,The spot gets narrower and narrower.,2013-01-14
00:00:31.630,00:00:33.490,The sides are getting cut off by the slit.,2013-01-14
00:00:33.490,00:00:35.660,It makes complete sense.,2013-01-14
00:00:35.660,00:00:40.340,And if you stop there you would never realize that Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle,2013-01-14
00:00:40.340,00:00:41.550,is at work.,2013-01-14
00:00:41.550,00:00:45.540,But if you keep going something strange happens.,2013-01-14
00:00:45.540,00:00:51.420,As you make the slit ever narrower the spot starts to spread out.,2013-01-14
00:00:51.420,00:00:54.020,Isn’t that incredible?,2013-01-14
00:00:54.020,00:01:00.370,"You are making the slit narrower, and yet the spot on the wall is getting wider.",2013-01-14
00:01:00.370,00:01:05.100,"The narrower you make it, the wider that spot on the wall becomes.",2013-01-14
00:01:05.100,00:01:09.049,To understand this we have to look at Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle.,2013-01-14
00:01:09.049,00:01:14.690,"Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle is normally written as delta x, delta p is greater than",2013-01-14
00:01:14.690,00:01:17.570,or equal to h on four pi.,2013-01-14
00:01:17.570,00:01:18.570,So what does this mean?,2013-01-14
00:01:18.570,00:01:22.600,"Well, it is about the position and the momentum of a particle.",2013-01-14
00:01:22.600,00:01:26.289,So x is the position of the particle and p is its momentum.,2013-01-14
00:01:26.289,00:01:32.579,So delta x is the uncertainty in position and delta p is the uncertainty in the momentum.,2013-01-14
00:01:32.579,00:01:36.900,Now if you multiply those two quantities together they must always be greater than or equal,2013-01-14
00:01:36.900,00:01:38.909,to h on four pi.,2013-01-14
00:01:38.909,00:01:40.679,Now h is Planck’s Constant.,2013-01-14
00:01:40.679,00:01:44.270,"And that deserves a video all to itself, like this one by 60 Symbols.",2013-01-14
00:01:44.270,00:01:47.189,But for our purposes it is just a very small number.,2013-01-14
00:01:47.189,00:01:51.659,"So in our every day lives we don’t come up against this uncertainty relation, because",2013-01-14
00:01:51.659,00:01:54.069,"everything is much, much bigger than h.",2013-01-14
00:01:54.069,00:02:00.109,But as we narrowed the slit we were decreasing delta x for those photons.,2013-01-14
00:02:00.109,00:02:04.740,So we were getting more and more precise about where the photons were passing through that,2013-01-14
00:02:04.740,00:02:05.860,slit.,2013-01-14
00:02:05.860,00:02:11.650,"And in a certain point you come to this limit so that if you narrow this any further, you",2013-01-14
00:02:11.650,00:02:14.700,are going to break this uncertainty relationship.,2013-01-14
00:02:14.700,00:02:19.390,So what needs to happen is the uncertainty of momentum needs to go up.,2013-01-14
00:02:19.390,00:02:24.459,"I should specify this is uncertainty in momentum in the x direction, in the horizontal direction.",2013-01-14
00:02:24.459,00:02:29.849,"So if before photons were going perfectly straight, now they must veer off to the left",2013-01-14
00:02:29.849,00:02:35.090,or the to the right to ensure that we don’t break Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation.,2013-01-14
00:02:35.090,00:02:39.819,"And the more you decrease your uncertainty in position, the more narrow you make that",2013-01-14
00:02:39.819,00:02:44.230,"slit, the more the uncertainty in momentum has to go up.",2013-01-14
00:02:44.230,00:02:47.760,"And so if these photons are going to the left and the right, .that is going to produce a",2013-01-14
00:02:47.760,00:02:49.010,might wider beam.,2013-01-14
00:02:49.010,00:02:54.120,"It is really, really non intuitive, but it is the way the world works.",2013-01-14
00:02:54.120,00:02:59.909,&gt;&gt; It must be the sun playing tricks with my mind.,2013-01-14
00:02:59.909,00:03:08.209,"&gt;&gt; What about.... this is really going to test you, right?",2013-01-14
00:03:08.209,00:03:10.000,[ multiple voices ],2013-01-14
00:03:10.000,00:03:14.070,I have got to say a big thank you to Professor Walter Lewin at MIT.,2013-01-14
00:03:14.070,00:03:15.549,He inspired me to make this video.,2013-01-14
00:03:15.549,00:03:19.579,And I also have to say a big thanks to the University of Sydney for letting me use their,2013-01-14
00:03:19.579,00:03:24.400,equipment and especially to Tom and Ralph for helping me set this all up.,2013-01-14
00:03:24.400,00:03:26.520,"Oh, and just one more thing.",2013-01-14
00:03:26.520,00:03:30.370,"I should point out that this explanation of the experiment is slightly controversial,",2013-01-14
00:03:30.370,00:03:34.250,at least in that Henry from Minute Physics and I have been debating whether it is really,2013-01-14
00:03:34.250,00:03:35.340,that counter intuitive.,2013-01-14
00:03:35.340,00:03:40.739,"I mean, if you see light as a wave, then all light is doing here is defracting.",2013-01-14
00:03:40.739,00:03:45.430,That is the phenomenon where if a wave passes through the slit it bends at the corners and,2013-01-14
00:03:45.430,00:03:46.860,radiates out in all directions.,2013-01-14
00:03:46.860,00:03:49.340,And that explains the spreading of the beam.,2013-01-14
00:03:49.340,00:03:50.980,But that goes to the very nature of light.,2013-01-14
00:03:50.980,00:03:53.069,Is it made of waves or particles?,2013-01-14
00:03:53.069,00:03:55.400,That is something that I would like to explore in the coming weeks.,2013-01-14
00:03:55.400,00:03:56.810,So stay tuned for that.,2013-01-14
00:03:56.810,00:04:00.569,"But Henry has an excellent video about Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, which I think makes",2013-01-14
00:04:00.569,00:04:02.400,it more intuitive and less spooky.,2013-01-14
00:04:02.400,00:04:04.370,"So if you want to check that out, click on the annotation.",2013-01-14
00:04:04.370,00:04:11.480,It is a really good video.,2013-01-14
