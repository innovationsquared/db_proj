00:00:01.590,00:00:06.190,I am here at the University of Sydney where the mechanical engineering shop has built,2014-03-17
00:00:06.190,00:00:08.570,this incredible piece of apparatus for me.,2014-03-17
00:00:08.570,00:00:14.160,"It is a forty pound, that is nineteen kilogram flywheel on the end of a meter long shaft.",2014-03-17
00:00:14.160,00:00:19.720,Can you imagine trying to hold this out horizontally with just one hand at this end?,2014-03-17
00:00:19.720,00:00:22.390,It is virtually...,2014-03-17
00:00:22.390,00:00:23.390,"it is impossible, ok?",2014-03-17
00:00:23.390,00:00:25.380,No I'm going to let go.,2014-03-17
00:00:25.380,00:00:27.310,You going to be able to hold this at all?,2014-03-17
00:00:27.310,00:00:28.740,I hope so.,2014-03-17
00:00:28.740,00:00:30.171,Can you lift it out?,2014-03-17
00:00:30.171,00:00:31.590,"Make it horizontal - hold it, hold it, hold it.",2014-03-17
00:00:31.590,00:00:32.590,Come on.,2014-03-17
00:00:32.590,00:00:33.880,Just try to - I want you to hold it out horizontal.,2014-03-17
00:00:33.880,00:00:34.880,See if you can.,2014-03-17
00:00:34.880,00:00:35.880,"Hold it, hold it!",2014-03-17
00:00:35.880,00:00:36.880,"Ahh, come on!",2014-03-17
00:00:36.880,00:00:37.880,No.,2014-03-17
00:00:37.880,00:00:43.230,What I'm going to do is I am going to spin this up to a few thousand RPM and then I'm,2014-03-17
00:00:43.230,00:00:48.190,"going to attempt just that, to hold it from one end and have it out horizontally.",2014-03-17

00:00:55.990,00:00:57.550,Boom.,2014-03-17
00:00:57.550,00:01:03.550,I'm going to let go with my left hand.,2014-03-17
00:01:03.550,00:01:09.630,"What you'll see is that the shaft remains horizontal, see it going around there.",2014-03-17
00:01:09.630,00:01:12.200,It almost looks as though the wheel is weightless.,2014-03-17
00:01:12.200,00:01:13.459,How does this work?,2014-03-17
00:01:13.459,00:01:17.140,"Well instead of pulling the wheel down to the ground as you'd expect, the weight of",2014-03-17
00:01:17.140,00:01:20.659,the wheel creates a torque which pushes it around in a circle.,2014-03-17
00:01:20.659,00:01:23.479,You may recognise this as gyroscopic precession.,2014-03-17

00:01:29.540,00:01:32.049,Here I want to try something more extreme.,2014-03-17
00:01:32.049,00:01:37.549,I'm going to try to lift it over my head with one hand while it's spinning.,2014-03-17
00:01:37.549,00:01:38.549,Wish me luck.,2014-03-17
00:01:38.549,00:01:42.549,"But before I make the attempt, Rod wisely suggests that I first check if I can lift",2014-03-17
00:01:42.549,00:01:44.389,the wheel above my head without it spinning.,2014-03-17
00:01:44.389,00:01:48.400,"OK, let's prove that I could lift it, just this end, without it spinning.",2014-03-17
00:01:48.400,00:01:49.829,Here we go.,2014-03-17
00:01:49.829,00:01:53.700,agggh I mean it's just kind of awkward with the,2014-03-17

00:01:54.770,00:01:55.850,Careful!,2014-03-17
00:01:55.850,00:01:59.090,"Ah, che Careful!",2014-03-17
00:01:59.090,00:02:01.249,Ha Oooohhh,2014-03-17
00:02:01.249,00:02:03.409,Just barely.,2014-03-17
00:02:03.409,00:02:07.859,"Oh goodness, do you even lift?",2014-03-17
00:02:07.859,00:02:08.859,Clearly I do not.,2014-03-17
00:02:08.859,00:02:13.450,"Undaunted by my lack of strength, I'm going for it, but I want to make sure the wheel",2014-03-17
00:02:13.450,00:02:17.590,is spinning as fast as possible to give me the best chance of success.,2014-03-17
00:02:17.590,00:02:20.219,Give it ten more seconds.,2014-03-17

00:02:27.489,00:02:28.489,That was perfect.,2014-03-17
00:02:28.489,00:02:34.100,Now I'm going to release my left hand and holding only with my right hand at the end,2014-03-17

00:04:02.029,00:04:04.269,you mean when you're lifting it feels light?,2014-03-17
00:04:04.269,00:04:05.269,Yeah.,2014-03-17
00:04:05.269,00:04:08.529,It shouldn't!,2014-03-17
00:04:08.529,00:04:09.529,I know.,2014-03-17
00:04:09.529,00:04:11.510,"Hahahaha Honestly, I have lifted it up with one hand",2014-03-17

00:04:23.580,00:04:27.680,It felt like I was not struggling like I was not putting in the amount of force that you'd,2014-03-17
00:04:27.680,00:04:31.449,think to lift that kind of weight.,2014-03-17

00:04:36.520,00:04:38.020,We can't do that part of the experiment.,2014-03-17
00:04:38.020,00:04:43.520,What we could maybe do is I could stand on a scale and we could see what the weight of,2014-03-17
