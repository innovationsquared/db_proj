00:00:01.819,00:00:03.460,Twenty-one grams.,2013-05-09
00:00:03.460,00:00:10.200,"That is the mass of all of the electrons in your body if, like me, you weigh about 70",2013-05-09
00:00:10.200,00:00:11.200,kilograms.,2013-05-09
00:00:11.200,00:00:16.129,"Now all of the mass comes from the Higgs mechanism, which means that as your electrons are traveling",2013-05-09
00:00:16.129,00:00:19.750,"through space time, they interact with the Higgs field and it is that that gives them",2013-05-09
00:00:19.750,00:00:20.800,their mass.,2013-05-09
00:00:20.800,00:00:23.920,It slows them down and stops them from traveling at the speed of light.,2013-05-09
00:00:23.920,00:00:27.580,But most of your mass doesn’t come from the Higgs mechanism.,2013-05-09
00:00:27.580,00:00:31.390,And neither does all of this stuff that you see around you.,2013-05-09
00:00:31.390,00:00:35.500,The mass is coming from somewhere quite different and that is because most of your mass and,2013-05-09
00:00:35.500,00:00:40.640,most of this mass comes from neutrons and protons and they are not fundamental particles.,2013-05-09
00:00:40.640,00:00:43.739,They are made of constituent particles called quarks.,2013-05-09
00:00:43.739,00:00:47.840,Now the theory that describes quarks and their interactions with each other through gluons,2013-05-09
00:00:47.840,00:00:50.320,is called quantum chromo dynamics.,2013-05-09
00:00:50.320,00:00:52.890,And chromo is the Greek word for color.,2013-05-09
00:00:52.890,00:00:56.950,So in some way these objects are meant to carry the color charge.,2013-05-09
00:00:56.950,00:01:01.140,"But they are much, much smaller than the wavelength of visible light, so there is no way that",2013-05-09
00:01:01.140,00:01:05.530,"they are actually colored, but it is a useful analogy that helps us think about how they",2013-05-09
00:01:05.530,00:01:08.220,interact and the particles that they can make up.,2013-05-09
00:01:08.220,00:01:09.680,Now the rules are pretty simple.,2013-05-09
00:01:09.680,00:01:14.810,"In order for a particle to exist, it must be colorless or white, like this house.",2013-05-09
00:01:14.810,00:01:17.479,Now you can accomplish that in two different ways.,2013-05-09
00:01:17.479,00:01:22.250,"You could make three quarks in where each one is a different color, red, green and blue,",2013-05-09
00:01:22.250,00:01:24.820,so overall they combine to produce white.,2013-05-09
00:01:24.820,00:01:30.380,Or you could use a quark and an anti quark where one is a color like green and the other,2013-05-09
00:01:30.380,00:01:34.759,"is its anti color, say, magenta.",2013-05-09
00:01:34.759,00:01:38.860,Now what I would like to do on this little patch of beach behind me is simulate how quarks,2013-05-09
00:01:38.860,00:01:42.100,actually bind together and form different particles.,2013-05-09
00:01:42.100,00:01:45.899,Now for this you need to remember that in the last video we talked about how empty space,2013-05-09
00:01:45.899,00:01:47.700,is not truly empty.,2013-05-09
00:01:47.700,00:01:52.180,So the beach here is has these undulations in it which represent the fluctuations in,2013-05-09
00:01:52.180,00:01:53.180,the gluon field.,2013-05-09
00:01:53.180,00:01:57.530,But you have to imagine this beach sort of rippling and these bumps coming and going.,2013-05-09
00:01:57.530,00:02:02.680,"Now that is really important, because to get rid of those fluctuations actually takes energy.",2013-05-09
00:02:02.680,00:02:05.710,And this is an important part of binding the quarks together.,2013-05-09
00:02:05.710,00:02:10.690,The existence of quarks actually suppresses the gluon fluctuations and creates what is,2013-05-09
00:02:10.690,00:02:15.750,"called a flux tube, an area where there is really nothing in the vacuum and that is in",2013-05-09
00:02:15.750,00:02:17.521,between this quark and the anti quark.,2013-05-09
00:02:17.521,00:02:22.010,"And that pairs them up and creates what is called a meson, the quark, anti quark pair.",2013-05-09
00:02:22.010,00:02:26.580,"What is interesting about that flux tube is that as these quarks become more separated,",2013-05-09
00:02:26.580,00:02:31.330,the flux tube remains the same diameter and the same sort of depth of suppression of the,2013-05-09
00:02:31.330,00:02:33.740,"field, which means that the force doesn't actually increase.",2013-05-09
00:02:33.740,00:02:34.750,It is not like a spring.,2013-05-09
00:02:34.750,00:02:36.410,It is not like an elastic band.,2013-05-09
00:02:36.410,00:02:40.550,The force is the same that is pulling these quarks back together.,2013-05-09
00:02:40.550,00:02:45.610,But you are putting more work in as you move these quarks and anti quarks further apart.,2013-05-09
00:02:45.610,00:02:49.060,"And so for a time people thought: Well, these quarks are always going t be confined, however",2013-05-09
00:02:49.060,00:02:50.060,far you move them.,2013-05-09
00:02:50.060,00:02:52.190,You are just going to get a really long flux tube.,2013-05-09
00:02:52.190,00:02:55.730,But what actually happens is you that you put in enough energy that you can actually,2013-05-09
00:02:55.730,00:02:59.370,"create a quark, anti quark pair.",2013-05-09
00:02:59.370,00:03:01.190,"&gt;&gt; Nevertheless, the quarks are still combined.",2013-05-09
00:03:01.190,00:03:06.810,"You can never see an individual quark, because if you try to pull it out, you put so much",2013-05-09
00:03:06.810,00:03:11.110,"energy into the situation that another quark, anti quark pair will be created.",2013-05-09
00:03:11.110,00:03:17.780,"&gt;&gt; Now to form a proton, we are going to need an up quark, another up quark and a down quark.",2013-05-09
00:03:17.780,00:03:22.020,Now the standard model of a proton that you have probably seen involves these quarks bounded,2013-05-09
00:03:22.020,00:03:25.150,together by little gluon springs that go between them.,2013-05-09
00:03:25.150,00:03:27.910,&gt;&gt; We know that that picture is totally wrong now.,2013-05-09
00:03:27.910,00:03:34.060,Even in the best sense you might have hoped that you would see flux tubes around the edge,2013-05-09
00:03:34.060,00:03:35.060,of the triangle.,2013-05-09
00:03:35.060,00:03:36.060,"But we know that, in fact, they don’t do that.",2013-05-09
00:03:36.060,00:03:39.069,That you get these y shaped flex tubes.,2013-05-09
00:03:39.069,00:03:44.420,&gt;&gt; The crazy thing about a proton is that there may be more than three quarks there.,2013-05-09
00:03:44.420,00:03:50.260,"You see, you can have additional quark, anti quark pairs pop in and out of existence.",2013-05-09
00:03:50.260,00:03:56.030,"So at any given time there could be five or seven or nine, any odd number of quarks could",2013-05-09
00:03:56.030,00:03:58.180,make up a proton.,2013-05-09
00:03:58.180,00:04:01.420,So this is what a proton actually looks like.,2013-05-09
00:04:01.420,00:04:05.230,You can see that the quarks like to sit on those lumps in the gluon field.,2013-05-09
00:04:05.230,00:04:09.490,"And you can see the two up quarks and a down quark, but there is also a strange quark and",2013-05-09
00:04:09.490,00:04:14.450,"an anti strange quark, which is strange, because you don’t normally think of these quarks",2013-05-09
00:04:14.450,00:04:18.400,"being inside a proton, but they can be at any particular point in time.",2013-05-09
00:04:18.400,00:04:21.850,And you can also see that these quarks have cleared out the vacuum.,2013-05-09
00:04:21.850,00:04:26.060,And you can see that there is kind of these flux tubes which are the areas where the gluon,2013-05-09
00:04:26.060,00:04:27.980,field has been suppressed.,2013-05-09
00:04:27.980,00:04:30.080,And that is really what is binding these quarks together.,2013-05-09
00:04:30.080,00:04:34.759,&gt;&gt; That is the strong force that binds quarks into the heart of the proton.,2013-05-09
00:04:34.759,00:04:40.800,&gt;&gt; It is intrinsically related to the fact that clearing out those fluctuations has more,2013-05-09
00:04:40.800,00:04:43.340,energy than where they are.,2013-05-09
00:04:43.340,00:04:44.750,&gt;&gt; That is right.,2013-05-09
00:04:44.750,00:04:48.290,It costs energy to clear the vacuum.,2013-05-09
00:04:48.290,00:04:50.820,&gt;&gt; So where is the mass of the proton really coming from?,2013-05-09
00:04:50.820,00:04:55.320,"Well, of course, the constituent quarks do interact with the Higgs field and that gives",2013-05-09
00:04:55.320,00:04:57.440,them a small amount of mass.,2013-05-09
00:04:57.440,00:05:01.940,But if you add up the mass of all the quarks in the proton it would only account for about,2013-05-09
00:05:01.940,00:05:05.370,one percent of its total mass.,2013-05-09
00:05:05.370,00:05:07.650,So where is the rest of the mass coming from?,2013-05-09
00:05:07.650,00:05:09.730,The answer is: energy.,2013-05-09
00:05:09.730,00:05:12.620,"You know, Einstein’s famous equation: E equals mc squared.",2013-05-09
00:05:12.620,00:05:16.690,"Well, that says we have got a lot of energy for just a little bit of a mass.",2013-05-09
00:05:16.690,00:05:21.600,But if you rearrange the equation you can see that we can get an amount of mass if there,2013-05-09
00:05:21.600,00:05:23.780,is lots of energy there.,2013-05-09
00:05:23.780,00:05:26.750,And that is really where most of the mass of the proton is coming from.,2013-05-09
00:05:26.750,00:05:31.940,It is from the fact that there are these energy fluctuations in the gluon field and the quarks,2013-05-09
00:05:31.940,00:05:33.980,are interacting with those gluons.,2013-05-09
00:05:33.980,00:05:35.230,That is where your mass is coming from.,2013-05-09
00:05:35.230,00:05:37.680,It is coming from the energy that is in there.,2013-05-09
00:05:37.680,00:05:41.800,"You know, Einstein talked about, well, if I had a hot cup of tea, it would actually",2013-05-09
00:05:41.800,00:05:46.610,have a slightly greater mass than the same cup of tea when cold.,2013-05-09
00:05:46.610,00:05:47.610,And he was right.,2013-05-09
00:05:47.610,00:05:51.830,"I mean, you can’t measure it with a cup of tea, but most of your mass you owe to E",2013-05-09
00:05:51.830,00:05:57.000,"equals mc squared, you owe to the fact that your mass is packed with energy, because of",2013-05-09
00:05:57.000,00:06:02.060,the interactions between the quarks and these gluon fluctuations in that gluon field.,2013-05-09
00:06:02.060,00:06:06.330,"I think it is extraordinary, because what we think of as ordinarily empty space, you",2013-05-09
00:06:06.330,00:06:10.850,"know, that turns out to be the thing that gives us all most of our mass.",2013-05-09
