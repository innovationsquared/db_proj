00:00:05.130,00:00:08.170,This is a picture of the supermassive black hole,2022-05-12

00:00:10.680,00:00:13.170,known as Sagittarius A*.,2022-05-12
00:00:13.170,00:00:15.350,The black hole itself doesn't emit light,2022-05-12
00:00:15.350,00:00:19.380,so what we're seeing is the hot plasma swirling around it.,2022-05-12
00:00:19.380,00:00:22.960,This is only the second picture of a black hole ever.,2022-05-12

00:01:29.173,00:01:32.400,and witness something truly amazing.,2022-05-12
00:01:32.400,00:01:34.610,A collection of stars zipping around,2022-05-12

00:01:39.480,00:01:41.040,One of the stars was clocked,2022-05-12

00:03:09.060,00:03:11.440,But the biggest challenge of all in making an image,2022-05-12
00:03:11.440,00:03:14.480,of either supermassive black hole is that these objects,2022-05-12
00:03:14.480,00:03:17.370,"are so compact and so far from Earth,",2022-05-12
00:03:17.370,00:03:21.600,"in the sky, they appear very, very tiny.",2022-05-12

00:03:23.620,00:03:27.950,take the whole sky and divide it into 180 degrees.,2022-05-12
00:03:27.950,00:03:31.486,The Andromeda galaxy spans about three degrees.,2022-05-12
00:03:31.486,00:03:35.780,Then divide one degree into 60 arcminutes,2022-05-12
00:03:36.714,00:03:40.543,and one arc minute into 60 arcseconds.,2022-05-12
00:03:41.840,00:03:44.143,"Divide an arcsecond into 100,",2022-05-12

00:03:51.370,00:03:55.023,And this is the size of the black holes on the sky.,2022-05-12
00:03:56.720,00:04:00.063,It's equivalent to taking a picture of a donut on the moon.,2022-05-12
00:04:01.290,00:04:04.170,"Now, there is no optical telescope on Earth",2022-05-12
00:04:04.170,00:04:06.310,that could produce such an image.,2022-05-12
00:04:06.310,00:04:08.881,"So in this video, I wanna answer two questions.",2022-05-12
00:04:08.881,00:04:10.840,How did they do it?,2022-05-12
00:04:10.840,00:04:13.500,And what are we actually looking at?,2022-05-12
00:04:13.500,00:04:14.590,"So starting with,",2022-05-12
00:04:14.590,00:04:17.114,how did they make these images of black holes?,2022-05-12
00:04:17.114,00:04:18.490,"Well, the first thing to know",2022-05-12
00:04:18.490,00:04:20.560,is they weren't made with visible light.,2022-05-12
00:04:20.560,00:04:22.070,They were made using radio waves,2022-05-12
00:04:22.070,00:04:24.820,with a wavelength of 1.3 millimeters.,2022-05-12
00:04:24.820,00:04:27.945,So all the observations were taken by radio telescopes,2022-05-12
00:04:27.945,00:04:30.733,which essentially look like huge satellite dishes.,2022-05-12
00:04:32.290,00:04:36.000,"When a source emits radio waves, they travel out radially",2022-05-12
00:04:36.000,00:04:39.240,"in all directions, but Earth is so far away",2022-05-12
00:04:39.240,00:04:41.250,"that by the time they reach our planet,",2022-05-12
00:04:41.250,00:04:45.060,the wavefronts are almost completely flat and parallel.,2022-05-12
00:04:45.060,00:04:47.800,This is known as a plane wave.,2022-05-12
00:04:47.800,00:04:49.540,A radio telescope works,2022-05-12
00:04:49.540,00:04:52.820,by scanning back and forth across the sky.,2022-05-12
00:04:52.820,00:04:55.500,"When it is pointed directly at a radio source,",2022-05-12
00:04:55.500,00:04:57.480,it produces a bright spot.,2022-05-12
00:04:57.480,00:05:00.296,"That's because all the radio waves travel the same distance,",2022-05-12
00:05:00.296,00:05:04.210,"bounce off the dish, and are received at the same time",2022-05-12
00:05:04.210,00:05:07.440,so they are in phase meaning peaks line up with peaks,2022-05-12
00:05:07.440,00:05:09.350,and troughs with troughs.,2022-05-12
00:05:09.350,00:05:11.940,They constructively interfere.,2022-05-12
00:05:11.940,00:05:14.164,"As the telescope moves past the source,",2022-05-12
00:05:14.164,00:05:17.800,some of the radio waves now travel farther than others,2022-05-12
00:05:17.800,00:05:20.100,"and therefore they meet up out of phase,",2022-05-12
00:05:20.100,00:05:21.560,"destructively interfere,",2022-05-12
00:05:21.560,00:05:25.071,and the intensity of the signal drops to zero.,2022-05-12
00:05:25.071,00:05:27.910,"To make a sharp image, you want this drop off",2022-05-12
00:05:27.910,00:05:30.010,to be as steep as possible,2022-05-12
00:05:30.010,00:05:32.150,so the telescope produces peak intensity,2022-05-12
00:05:32.150,00:05:34.470,only when aimed directly at the source,2022-05-12
00:05:34.470,00:05:36.210,and then the intensity drops rapidly,2022-05-12
00:05:36.210,00:05:39.796,when the dish is moved just a tiny bit in any direction.,2022-05-12
00:05:39.796,00:05:42.230,There are two ways of achieving this.,2022-05-12
00:05:42.230,00:05:45.150,One is to observe higher frequency radio waves.,2022-05-12
00:05:45.150,00:05:47.400,That way any slight movement of the telescope,2022-05-12
00:05:47.400,00:05:50.010,represents a greater fraction of a wavelength.,2022-05-12
00:05:50.010,00:05:53.280,This causes destructive interference to occur sooner.,2022-05-12
00:05:53.280,00:05:56.917,"The other way is to increase the diameter of the telescope,",2022-05-12
00:05:56.917,00:05:59.340,and this increases the difference in path length,2022-05-12
00:05:59.340,00:06:02.370,between radio waves on opposite sides of the telescope,2022-05-12
00:06:02.370,00:06:04.283,for a given angular adjustment.,2022-05-12
00:06:05.320,00:06:07.010,How narrowly a telescope,2022-05-12
00:06:07.010,00:06:09.060,can identify the source of radio waves,2022-05-12
00:06:09.060,00:06:12.040,is known as its angular resolution.,2022-05-12
00:06:12.040,00:06:14.970,You can think of it as the size of the spot on the sky,2022-05-12
00:06:14.970,00:06:17.012,that the telescope is sensitive to.,2022-05-12
00:06:17.012,00:06:19.200,"It is proportional to wavelength,",2022-05-12
00:06:19.200,00:06:22.807,and inversely proportional to the diameter of the telescope.,2022-05-12
00:06:22.807,00:06:25.758,The challenge with making a picture of a black hole,2022-05-12
00:06:25.758,00:06:27.750,is that you're trying to see the structure,2022-05-12
00:06:27.750,00:06:30.780,in a tiny area of the sky.,2022-05-12
00:06:30.780,00:06:32.770,Imagine scanning a radio telescope,2022-05-12
00:06:32.770,00:06:35.040,across the center of a black hole.,2022-05-12
00:06:35.040,00:06:36.560,You would want to see the bright spot,2022-05-12
00:06:36.560,00:06:38.650,as the telescope passes over the left edge,2022-05-12
00:06:38.650,00:06:40.870,and then a dark spot and then another bright spot,2022-05-12
00:06:40.870,00:06:43.060,as it passes the right edge.,2022-05-12
00:06:43.060,00:06:46.780,"The problem is, for any individual radio telescope on Earth,",2022-05-12
00:06:46.780,00:06:49.550,the angular resolution is too large.,2022-05-12
00:06:49.550,00:06:51.770,"So as it passes over the black hole,",2022-05-12
00:06:51.770,00:06:54.730,it would still be receiving radio waves from the left side,2022-05-12
00:06:54.730,00:06:57.770,as it begins receiving radio waves from the right side.,2022-05-12
00:06:57.770,00:06:59.320,The resolution isn't high enough,2022-05-12
00:06:59.320,00:07:01.340,to tell if there's a ring structure there,2022-05-12
00:07:01.340,00:07:05.259,"as we'd expect with a black hole, or if it's just a blob.",2022-05-12
00:07:05.259,00:07:08.960,Observing at shorter wavelengths isn't really an option,2022-05-12
00:07:08.960,00:07:12.170,because that light is blocked either by our atmosphere,2022-05-12
00:07:12.170,00:07:14.650,or by the matter around the black hole.,2022-05-12
00:07:14.650,00:07:16.630,"So if you wanna improve resolution,",2022-05-12
00:07:16.630,00:07:17.700,the only way you can do it,2022-05-12
00:07:17.700,00:07:20.639,is by increasing the diameter of the telescope.,2022-05-12
00:07:20.639,00:07:22.990,"But if you actually do the calculation,",2022-05-12
00:07:22.990,00:07:25.205,you find that the telescope you'd need,2022-05-12
00:07:25.205,00:07:27.930,would have to be the size of the Earth,2022-05-12
00:07:27.930,00:07:30.732,"in order to see the ring of a black hole,",2022-05-12
00:07:30.732,00:07:33.485,"which is obviously impossible,",2022-05-12
00:07:33.485,00:07:37.630,but there is a way to do something that's almost as good.,2022-05-12
00:07:37.630,00:07:40.630,"You don't need a complete dish the size of the Earth,",2022-05-12
00:07:40.630,00:07:41.910,just pieces of it.,2022-05-12

00:07:47.882,00:07:50.620,As long as you can properly combine the signals,2022-05-12

00:07:53.960,00:07:56.090,and destructive interference required,2022-05-12
00:07:56.090,00:07:58.700,to achieve the same angular resolution,2022-05-12
00:07:58.700,00:08:00.820,as an Earth-sized dish.,2022-05-12
00:08:00.820,00:08:04.680,This technique is called very long baseline interferometry.,2022-05-12
00:08:04.680,00:08:08.750,So the event horizon telescope is not just one telescope,2022-05-12
00:08:08.750,00:08:12.340,but a global network of radio observatories.,2022-05-12
00:08:12.340,00:08:13.320,All these telescopes,2022-05-12
00:08:13.320,00:08:16.346,observe Sagittarius A* at the same time.,2022-05-12
00:08:16.346,00:08:18.320,"Unlike a single telescope,",2022-05-12
00:08:18.320,00:08:21.430,you can't bounce all the radio waves to a central receiver,2022-05-12
00:08:21.430,00:08:23.380,and add them up in real time.,2022-05-12
00:08:23.380,00:08:27.090,So instead each telescope records the signal at its location,2022-05-12
00:08:27.090,00:08:30.027,and the exact time down to the femtosecond.,2022-05-12
00:08:30.027,00:08:32.671,Petabytes of data are generated.,2022-05-12
00:08:32.671,00:08:35.650,"But now that data needs to be brought together,",2022-05-12
00:08:35.650,00:08:36.930,and the fastest way to do it,2022-05-12
00:08:36.930,00:08:39.456,was actually to carry hard drives as hand luggage,2022-05-12
00:08:39.456,00:08:41.952,to centralized locations.,2022-05-12
00:08:41.952,00:08:44.421,"Now, think about the data we've got.",2022-05-12
00:08:44.421,00:08:46.910,Electrical signals and precise timings,2022-05-12
00:08:46.910,00:08:50.277,"from a number of radio telescopes around the world,",2022-05-12
00:08:50.277,00:08:52.590,but none of those radio telescopes,2022-05-12
00:08:52.590,00:08:54.100,has enough angular resolution,2022-05-12
00:08:54.100,00:08:56.427,to see the ring of the black hole.,2022-05-12
00:08:56.427,00:08:58.891,So how do you combine that data,2022-05-12
00:08:58.891,00:09:03.760,and get finer detail than any of the inputs?,2022-05-12
00:09:03.760,00:09:06.390,"Well, there is additional information",2022-05-12
00:09:06.390,00:09:09.534,in the relative distances between these telescopes,2022-05-12
00:09:09.534,00:09:12.270,and in the time delays between when a wavefront,2022-05-12
00:09:12.270,00:09:16.190,hits one telescope relative to the others.,2022-05-12
00:09:16.190,00:09:20.300,Imagine combining the signals from two distant telescopes.,2022-05-12
00:09:20.300,00:09:24.300,Let's say they both received the same wave at the same time,2022-05-12
00:09:24.300,00:09:26.950,so those waves were coming in phase.,2022-05-12
00:09:26.950,00:09:28.010,"Well, then the source",2022-05-12
00:09:28.010,00:09:30.760,must have been located directly between them.,2022-05-12
00:09:30.760,00:09:33.040,The radio waves would've traveled the same distance,2022-05-12
00:09:33.040,00:09:36.751,"to each telescope to arrive at the same time,",2022-05-12
00:09:36.751,00:09:39.147,"except with just two telescopes,",2022-05-12
00:09:39.147,00:09:42.800,that only narrows it down to a line in the sky,2022-05-12
00:09:42.800,00:09:45.810,that is equidistant from both telescopes.,2022-05-12
00:09:45.810,00:09:48.799,The source could have been anywhere on that line.,2022-05-12
00:09:48.799,00:09:51.008,And it's actually worse than that.,2022-05-12
00:09:51.008,00:09:53.040,It's possible that the source,2022-05-12
00:09:53.040,00:09:55.320,could be exactly one wavelength closer,2022-05-12
00:09:55.320,00:09:58.220,to one of the telescopes and that way the radio waves,2022-05-12
00:09:58.220,00:10:01.173,would still arrive perfectly in phase.,2022-05-12
00:10:01.173,00:10:03.810,Or the difference could be two or three,2022-05-12
00:10:03.810,00:10:06.610,"or four wavelengths, but you get the point.",2022-05-12
00:10:06.610,00:10:09.970,"So from one pair of telescopes, the information we get",2022-05-12
00:10:09.970,00:10:11.877,about the source is actually a series,2022-05-12
00:10:11.877,00:10:14.623,of bright and dark fringes.,2022-05-12
00:10:15.640,00:10:19.050,"Telescopes that are close together produce wide fringes,",2022-05-12
00:10:19.050,00:10:22.240,while those that are far apart produce narrow fringes.,2022-05-12
00:10:22.240,00:10:25.450,"So to make an image, you need pairs of telescopes",2022-05-12
00:10:25.450,00:10:29.685,at all different orientations and different distances apart.,2022-05-12
00:10:29.685,00:10:33.780,Each pair makes a different interference pattern.,2022-05-12
00:10:33.780,00:10:36.416,"And then by combining all these patterns,",2022-05-12
00:10:36.416,00:10:41.390,we get an image of the black hole which created them.,2022-05-12
00:10:41.390,00:10:43.250,"But now that we have this picture,",2022-05-12
00:10:43.250,00:10:45.422,what exactly is it showing us?,2022-05-12
00:10:45.422,00:10:47.540,"Well, this is how I explained it",2022-05-12
00:10:47.540,00:10:50.208,when the first image of a black hole was released.,2022-05-12
00:10:50.208,00:10:54.597,So here is my mock black hole of science.,2022-05-12
00:10:54.597,00:10:58.430,And this sphere represents the event horizon.,2022-05-12
00:10:58.430,00:10:59.770,"Once you're inside here,",2022-05-12
00:10:59.770,00:11:02.440,"there is no coming back, not even for light.",2022-05-12
00:11:02.440,00:11:04.560,The radius of the event horizon,2022-05-12
00:11:04.560,00:11:07.205,is known as the Schwarzschild radius.,2022-05-12
00:11:07.205,00:11:09.920,"Now, if we were just to look at a black hole",2022-05-12
00:11:09.920,00:11:11.610,"with nothing around it, we would not be able",2022-05-12
00:11:11.610,00:11:13.670,"to make an image like this because, well,",2022-05-12
00:11:13.670,00:11:16.110,it would just absorb all electromagnetic radiation,2022-05-12
00:11:16.110,00:11:19.270,"that falls on it, but the black hole that they're looking at",2022-05-12
00:11:19.270,00:11:22.895,has matter around it in an accretion disk.,2022-05-12
00:11:22.895,00:11:26.315,"In this accretion disk, there is dust and gas",2022-05-12
00:11:26.315,00:11:29.530,swirling around here very chaotically.,2022-05-12
00:11:29.530,00:11:33.060,It's incredibly hot. We're talking millions of degrees.,2022-05-12
00:11:33.060,00:11:35.140,"And it's going really fast,",2022-05-12
00:11:35.140,00:11:37.940,a significant fraction of the speed of light.,2022-05-12
00:11:37.940,00:11:41.040,And it's this matter that the black hole feeds off,2022-05-12
00:11:41.040,00:11:43.940,"and gets bigger and bigger over time,",2022-05-12
00:11:43.940,00:11:45.770,but you'll notice that the accretion disk,2022-05-12
00:11:45.770,00:11:49.580,does not extend all the way in to the event horizon.,2022-05-12
00:11:49.580,00:11:50.550,Why is that?,2022-05-12
00:11:50.550,00:11:51.770,Well that's because there is,2022-05-12
00:11:51.770,00:11:54.850,"an innermost stable circular orbit,",2022-05-12
00:11:54.850,00:11:58.790,"and for matter around a non-spinning black hole,",2022-05-12
00:11:58.790,00:12:02.553,that orbit is at three Schwarzschild radii.,2022-05-12
00:12:03.650,00:12:05.930,"Now, in all likelihood, the black hole",2022-05-12
00:12:05.930,00:12:08.270,at the center of our galaxy will be spinning.,2022-05-12
00:12:08.270,00:12:09.640,"But for simplicity,",2022-05-12
00:12:09.640,00:12:11.810,I'm just considering the non-spinning case.,2022-05-12
00:12:11.810,00:12:14.210,You can see my video on spinning black holes,2022-05-12
00:12:14.210,00:12:16.280,if you wanna find out more about that.,2022-05-12
00:12:16.280,00:12:18.580,So this is the innermost orbit,2022-05-12
00:12:18.580,00:12:21.380,for matter going around a black hole.,2022-05-12
00:12:21.380,00:12:22.840,"If it goes inside this orbit,",2022-05-12
00:12:22.840,00:12:25.980,it very quickly goes into the center of the black hole,2022-05-12
00:12:25.980,00:12:30.440,"and we never hear from it again, but there is something",2022-05-12
00:12:30.440,00:12:35.440,"that can orbit closer to the black hole, and that is light.",2022-05-12
00:12:35.883,00:12:40.883,"Because light has no mass, it can actually orbit",2022-05-12
00:12:42.016,00:12:46.280,at 1.5 Schwarzschild radii.,2022-05-12
00:12:46.280,00:12:48.520,"Now here, I'm representing it with a ring,",2022-05-12
00:12:48.520,00:12:50.740,but really this could be in any orientation.,2022-05-12
00:12:50.740,00:12:54.170,So it's a sphere of photon orbits.,2022-05-12
00:12:54.170,00:12:55.630,"And if you were standing there,",2022-05-12
00:12:55.630,00:12:57.420,"of course you could never go there,",2022-05-12
00:12:57.420,00:12:59.130,"but if you could, you could look forward",2022-05-12
00:12:59.130,00:13:01.390,and actually see the back of your head,2022-05-12
00:13:01.390,00:13:05.930,'cause the photons could go around and complete that orbit.,2022-05-12
00:13:05.930,00:13:08.990,"Now, the photon sphere is an unstable orbit",2022-05-12
00:13:08.990,00:13:12.540,meaning eventually either the photons have to spiral,2022-05-12
00:13:12.540,00:13:17.540,into the singularity or spiral out and head off to infinity.,2022-05-12
00:13:17.910,00:13:19.570,"Now, the question I want to answer is,",2022-05-12
00:13:19.570,00:13:23.690,"what does this black, quote unquote, shadow in the image",2022-05-12
00:13:23.690,00:13:25.850,correspond to in this picture,2022-05-12
00:13:25.850,00:13:28.887,of what's actually going on around the black hole?,2022-05-12
00:13:28.887,00:13:32.450,Is it the event horizon? Are we simply looking at this?,2022-05-12
00:13:32.450,00:13:33.820,Or is it the photon sphere,2022-05-12
00:13:33.820,00:13:36.709,"or the innermost stable, circular orbit?",2022-05-12
00:13:36.709,00:13:38.523,"Well, things are complicated.",2022-05-12
00:13:38.523,00:13:42.440,"And the reason is, this black hole warps space-time",2022-05-12
00:13:42.440,00:13:45.580,around it which changes the path of light rays,2022-05-12
00:13:45.580,00:13:47.920,so they don't just go in straight lines,2022-05-12
00:13:47.920,00:13:49.820,like we normally imagine that they do.,2022-05-12
00:13:49.820,00:13:51.870,"I mean, they are going in straight lines,",2022-05-12
00:13:51.870,00:13:55.330,"but space-time's curved so yeah, they go in curves.",2022-05-12
00:13:55.330,00:13:56.610,So the best way to think of this,2022-05-12
00:13:56.610,00:13:59.790,is maybe to imagine parallel light rays coming in,2022-05-12
00:13:59.790,00:14:03.700,from the observer and striking this geometry here.,2022-05-12
00:14:03.700,00:14:05.350,"Of course, if the parallel light rays",2022-05-12
00:14:05.350,00:14:06.440,"cross the event horizon,",2022-05-12
00:14:06.440,00:14:08.130,we'll never see them again so they're gone.,2022-05-12
00:14:08.130,00:14:09.990,"That will definitely be a dark region,",2022-05-12
00:14:09.990,00:14:13.340,"but if a light ray comes in just above the event horizon,",2022-05-12
00:14:13.340,00:14:16.920,it too will get bent and end up crossing the event horizon.,2022-05-12
00:14:16.920,00:14:19.043,It ends up in the black hole.,2022-05-12
00:14:19.043,00:14:22.210,Even a light ray coming in the same distance away,2022-05-12
00:14:22.210,00:14:25.152,as the photon sphere will end up getting warped,2022-05-12
00:14:25.152,00:14:30.152,into the black hole and curving across the event horizon.,2022-05-12
00:14:30.310,00:14:34.330,So in order for you to get a parallel ray,2022-05-12
00:14:34.330,00:14:36.830,"which does not end up in the black hole,",2022-05-12
00:14:36.830,00:14:41.830,you actually have to go out 2.6 radii away.,2022-05-12
00:14:42.160,00:14:46.830,"If a light ray comes in 2.6 Schwarzschild radii away,",2022-05-12
00:14:46.830,00:14:49.370,it will just graze the photon sphere,2022-05-12
00:14:49.370,00:14:53.020,at its closest approach and then it will go off to infinity.,2022-05-12
00:14:53.020,00:14:58.020,And so the resulting shadow that we get looks like this.,2022-05-12
00:14:59.260,00:15:04.010,It is 2.6 times bigger than the event horizon.,2022-05-12
00:15:04.010,00:15:06.010,"And you say, what are we really looking at here?",2022-05-12
00:15:06.010,00:15:07.440,What is this shadow?,2022-05-12
00:15:07.440,00:15:10.790,Well in the center of it is the event horizon.,2022-05-12
00:15:10.790,00:15:15.200,It maps pretty cleanly onto the center of the shadow.,2022-05-12
00:15:15.200,00:15:18.352,"But if you think about it, light rays going above or below",2022-05-12
00:15:18.352,00:15:21.560,"also end up crossing the event horizon,",2022-05-12
00:15:21.560,00:15:23.520,just on the backside.,2022-05-12
00:15:23.520,00:15:26.180,"So in fact, what we get is the whole backside",2022-05-12
00:15:26.180,00:15:31.180,of the event horizon mapped onto a ring on this shadow.,2022-05-12
00:15:32.190,00:15:35.490,"So looking from our one point in space at the black hole,",2022-05-12
00:15:35.490,00:15:38.240,we actually get to see the entirety,2022-05-12
00:15:38.240,00:15:40.110,of the black hole's event horizon.,2022-05-12
00:15:40.110,00:15:42.220,"I mean, maybe it's silly to talk about seeing it",2022-05-12
00:15:42.220,00:15:44.480,"because it's completely black,",2022-05-12
00:15:44.480,00:15:46.219,but that really is where the points,2022-05-12
00:15:46.219,00:15:48.670,would map to on this shadow.,2022-05-12
00:15:48.670,00:15:51.680,It gets weirder than that because the light can come in,2022-05-12
00:15:51.680,00:15:54.570,"and go around the back and, say, get absorbed in the front,",2022-05-12
00:15:54.570,00:15:58.890,you get another image of the entire horizon next to that,2022-05-12
00:15:58.890,00:16:00.500,in another annular ring,2022-05-12
00:16:00.500,00:16:02.790,And then another one after that and another one after that.,2022-05-12
00:16:02.790,00:16:05.640,And you get basically infinite images of the event horizon,2022-05-12
00:16:05.640,00:16:08.490,as you approach the edge of this shadow.,2022-05-12
00:16:08.490,00:16:10.336,So what is the first light that we can see?,2022-05-12
00:16:10.336,00:16:13.410,It is those light rays that come in at just such an angle,2022-05-12
00:16:13.410,00:16:15.130,that they graze the photon sphere,2022-05-12
00:16:15.130,00:16:19.400,"and then end up at our telescopes, and they produce a shadow",2022-05-12
00:16:19.400,00:16:24.060,which is 2.6 times the size of the event horizon.,2022-05-12
00:16:24.060,00:16:26.470,So this is roughly what we'd see,2022-05-12
00:16:26.470,00:16:28.550,if we happen to be looking perpendicular,2022-05-12
00:16:28.550,00:16:32.170,"to the accretion disk, but more likely we will be looking",2022-05-12
00:16:32.170,00:16:35.760,at some sort of random angle to the accretion disk.,2022-05-12
00:16:35.760,00:16:38.230,We may be even looking edge on.,2022-05-12
00:16:38.230,00:16:42.170,"And in that case, do we see this shadow of the black hole?",2022-05-12
00:16:42.170,00:16:44.820,"You might think that we wouldn't, but the truth is",2022-05-12
00:16:44.820,00:16:47.780,because of the way the black hole warps space time,2022-05-12
00:16:47.780,00:16:49.760,"and bends light rays,",2022-05-12
00:16:49.760,00:16:53.000,we actually see the back of the accretion disk.,2022-05-12
00:16:53.000,00:16:55.750,The way it works is light rays coming off the accretion disk,2022-05-12
00:16:55.750,00:16:59.340,bend over the top and end up coming to our telescopes.,2022-05-12
00:16:59.340,00:17:03.733,So what we end up seeing is something that looks like that.,2022-05-12
00:17:04.690,00:17:07.629,"Similarly, light from the bottom of the accretion disk",2022-05-12
00:17:07.629,00:17:11.170,"comes underneath, gets bent underneath the black hole",2022-05-12
00:17:12.090,00:17:14.080,and comes towards us like that.,2022-05-12
00:17:14.080,00:17:16.520,And this is where we get an image that looks something,2022-05-12
00:17:16.520,00:17:19.276,like the interstellar black hole.,2022-05-12
00:17:19.276,00:17:21.970,(dramatic music),2022-05-12
00:17:21.970,00:17:23.467,It gets even crazier than this,2022-05-12
00:17:23.467,00:17:26.030,'cause light that comes off the top,2022-05-12
00:17:26.030,00:17:28.020,of the accretion disk here,2022-05-12
00:17:28.020,00:17:30.660,"can go around the back of the black hole,",2022-05-12
00:17:30.660,00:17:34.050,"graze the photon sphere, and come out the bottom right here",2022-05-12
00:17:34.050,00:17:36.960,producing a very thin ring underneath the shadow.,2022-05-12
00:17:36.960,00:17:39.780,"Similarly, light from underneath the accretion disk",2022-05-12
00:17:39.780,00:17:43.240,in the front can go underneath and around the back,2022-05-12
00:17:43.240,00:17:44.520,"and come out over the top,",2022-05-12
00:17:44.520,00:17:48.830,which is why we see this ring of light here.,2022-05-12
00:17:48.830,00:17:50.070,This is what we could see,2022-05-12
00:17:50.070,00:17:53.200,"if we were very close to the black hole,",2022-05-12
00:17:53.200,00:17:55.620,something that looks truly spectacular.,2022-05-12
00:17:55.620,00:17:57.860,One other really important effect to consider,2022-05-12
00:17:57.860,00:18:00.550,is that the matter in this accretion disk,2022-05-12
00:18:00.550,00:18:03.410,"is going very fast, close to the speed of light.",2022-05-12
00:18:03.410,00:18:05.370,"And so if it's coming towards us,",2022-05-12
00:18:05.370,00:18:08.170,it's gonna look much brighter than if it's going away.,2022-05-12
00:18:08.170,00:18:11.110,That's called relativistic beaming or Doppler beaming.,2022-05-12
00:18:11.110,00:18:13.140,And so one side of this accretion disk,2022-05-12
00:18:13.140,00:18:14.810,"is going to look much brighter than the other,",2022-05-12
00:18:14.810,00:18:18.500,and that's why we're gonna see a bright spot in our image.,2022-05-12
00:18:18.500,00:18:20.440,So hopefully this gives you an idea,2022-05-12
00:18:20.440,00:18:22.230,of what we're really looking at,2022-05-12
00:18:22.230,00:18:24.913,when we look at an image of a black hole.,2022-05-12
