00:00:15.060,00:00:19.419,"- Now, you may have seen a Ruben's tube before. That's basically a pipe with a bunch of holes",2014-04-17
00:00:19.419,00:00:24.409,"in it, and you pump in a flammable gas, and light it on fire, so you basically create",2014-04-17
00:00:24.409,00:00:28.800,"a row of Bunsen burners. What's really cool is to play some sounds into the tube, and",2014-04-17
00:00:28.800,00:00:33.410,"you can actually set up standing waves. That is, there are areas, there are patterns of",2014-04-17

00:00:38.080,00:00:43.710,"vibration in other parts. Now, that affects the flow rate of the gas inside that tube",2014-04-17
00:00:43.710,00:00:48.000,"into the atmosphere, and so it affects the height of those flames. So basically, you",2014-04-17
00:00:48.000,00:00:52.700,can visualize the standing wave pattern. I'm currently in Denmark with a team of physics,2014-04-17
00:00:52.700,00:00:56.010,and chemistry demonstrators who have taken this experiment to the next level. They've,2014-04-17

00:01:14.000,00:01:20.020,"- Because, we really liked the Ruben's tube, but then we thought, ""when you put on more fire, then it always gets better.""",2014-04-17
00:01:22.560,00:01:23.840,Let's just turn [the frequency] down,2014-04-17
