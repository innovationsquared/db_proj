00:07:39.920,00:07:41.920,If you knew the relative contributions,2021-12-21
00:07:41.920,00:07:43.780,"of different frequency components,",2021-12-21
00:07:43.780,00:07:47.450,Kelvin now had a machine to automate the tedious task,2021-12-21
00:07:47.450,00:07:49.780,of predicting future tides.,2021-12-21
00:07:49.780,00:07:52.570,This was a great leap forward.,2021-12-21
00:07:52.570,00:07:54.710,Four hours of cranking the handle,2021-12-21
00:07:54.710,00:07:58.020,yielded a full year of tidal predictions.,2021-12-21
00:07:58.020,00:07:59.060,"But for many years,",2021-12-21
00:07:59.060,00:08:02.420,"the harder half of the problem was still done by hand,",2021-12-21
00:08:02.420,00:08:04.470,breaking apart an existing tide curve,2021-12-21
00:08:04.470,00:08:06.780,into its component frequencies.,2021-12-21
00:08:06.780,00:08:09.260,"To automate this step, Kelvin needed a machine",2021-12-21
00:08:09.260,00:08:12.940,"capable of multiplying the tide curve times the sine wave,",2021-12-21
00:08:12.940,00:08:15.520,and then taking its integral.,2021-12-21
00:08:15.520,00:08:18.770,What would such a device even look like?,2021-12-21
00:08:18.770,00:08:20.860,"With his older brother, James Thompson,",2021-12-21
00:08:20.860,00:08:23.650,Kelvin came up with a mechanical integrator.,2021-12-21
00:08:23.650,00:08:27.080,It consists of a ball on a rotating disk.,2021-12-21
00:08:27.080,00:08:28.970,"Due to the rotation of the disk,",2021-12-21
00:08:28.970,00:08:31.120,"the further the ball is from the center,",2021-12-21
00:08:31.120,00:08:33.200,the faster it spins.,2021-12-21
00:08:33.200,00:08:35.650,"If the ball is at the very center of the disk,",2021-12-21
00:08:35.650,00:08:37.410,it doesn't turn at all.,2021-12-21
00:08:37.410,00:08:38.780,"And if it's on the left side,",2021-12-21
00:08:38.780,00:08:41.730,it turns in the opposite direction.,2021-12-21
00:08:41.730,00:08:44.530,Now the motion of the ball is converted into an output,2021-12-21
00:08:44.530,00:08:45.820,"via a roller,",2021-12-21
00:08:45.820,00:08:49.653,which moves a pen up or down on the output graph paper.,2021-12-21
00:08:50.710,00:08:52.170,So the way it works,2021-12-21
00:08:52.170,00:08:54.270,is you trace the function you want to integrate,2021-12-21
00:08:54.270,00:08:55.430,"with a stylus,",2021-12-21
00:08:55.430,00:08:58.870,and the stylus controls the position of the ball on the disk,2021-12-21
00:08:58.870,00:09:01.520,and hence its speed of rotation.,2021-12-21
00:09:01.520,00:09:04.500,"This is transferred through the roller to the output,",2021-12-21
00:09:04.500,00:09:07.453,which plots the integral of the original function.,2021-12-21
00:09:08.570,00:09:10.640,"Now to decompose a tide curve,",2021-12-21
00:09:10.640,00:09:12.770,we don't just wanna integrate the function.,2021-12-21
00:09:12.770,00:09:14.230,We first wanna multiply it,2021-12-21
00:09:14.230,00:09:17.087,by a sine wave of a particular frequency.,2021-12-21
00:09:17.087,00:09:18.530,And the way to do this,2021-12-21
00:09:18.530,00:09:21.460,is to make the disk rotate back and forth,2021-12-21
00:09:21.460,00:09:23.223,at that specific frequency.,2021-12-21
00:09:24.080,00:09:25.500,Now the rotation of the ball,2021-12-21
00:09:25.500,00:09:28.230,"depends not only on where it is on the disk,",2021-12-21
00:09:28.230,00:09:32.010,but also on how the disc is turning at an instant.,2021-12-21
00:09:32.010,00:09:34.330,"You trace the tide curve with the stylus,",2021-12-21
00:09:34.330,00:09:37.820,"which moves the ball back and forth on the oscillating disk,",2021-12-21
00:09:37.820,00:09:41.040,and the roller sums up the integral of the tide curve,2021-12-21
00:09:41.040,00:09:43.030,times the sine wave.,2021-12-21
00:09:43.030,00:09:46.950,Simply divide by the total time to get the coefficient.,2021-12-21
00:09:46.950,00:09:48.930,Several of these ball and disk integrators,2021-12-21
00:09:48.930,00:09:50.730,can be connected in parallel,2021-12-21
00:09:50.730,00:09:54.220,with each disk oscillating at a different frequency,2021-12-21
00:09:54.220,00:09:55.610,to calculate the coefficients,2021-12-21
00:09:55.610,00:09:59.123,for multiple frequency components at the same time.,2021-12-21
00:10:00.550,00:10:02.440,Kelvin's analog computers,2021-12-21
00:10:02.440,00:10:05.520,revolutionized our ability to predict tides.,2021-12-21
00:10:05.520,00:10:07.610,Tidal curves from anywhere in the world,2021-12-21
00:10:07.610,00:10:10.630,could be turned into a set of sinusoidal coefficients,2021-12-21
00:10:10.630,00:10:13.680,using the ball and disk harmonic analyzer.,2021-12-21
00:10:13.680,00:10:16.150,And the resulting sinusoids could be added together,2021-12-21
00:10:16.150,00:10:17.710,to predict the future tides,2021-12-21
00:10:17.710,00:10:20.393,using his scotch yoke pulley machine.,2021-12-21
00:10:21.640,00:10:23.350,- [Derek] Kelvin's harmonic analyzers,2021-12-21
00:10:23.350,00:10:25.760,were the basis for a landmark analog computer,2021-12-21
00:10:25.760,00:10:27.780,"called the differential analyzer,",2021-12-21
00:10:27.780,00:10:29.650,and his tide predicting machines,2021-12-21
00:10:29.650,00:10:32.400,were used well into the 1960s.,2021-12-21
00:10:32.400,00:10:34.240,"In fact, they were later overhauled",2021-12-21
00:10:34.240,00:10:36.840,to include 26 frequency components,2021-12-21
00:10:36.840,00:10:40.383,and used to plan the allied invasion on D-Day.,2021-12-21
00:10:41.530,00:10:43.440,- The Germans expected any invasion,2021-12-21
00:10:43.440,00:10:45.700,to come at high tide to minimize the time,2021-12-21
00:10:45.700,00:10:48.560,Allied soldiers would be exposed on the beaches.,2021-12-21
00:10:48.560,00:10:51.000,So they installed millions of obstacles,2021-12-21
00:10:51.000,00:10:53.260,"that would be underwater by mid tide,",2021-12-21
00:10:53.260,00:10:56.270,many with explosive mines attached.,2021-12-21
00:10:56.270,00:10:59.760,But the allies spotted the obstacles and change tack.,2021-12-21
00:10:59.760,00:11:03.190,"Instead, they plan to begin the invasion at low tide.",2021-12-21
00:11:03.190,00:11:04.840,This would allow demolition teams,2021-12-21
00:11:04.840,00:11:07.700,"to first clear channels through the obstacles,",2021-12-21
00:11:07.700,00:11:10.130,then the main forces could come through those gaps,2021-12-21
00:11:10.130,00:11:11.730,as the water rose.,2021-12-21
00:11:11.730,00:11:13.670,This would also give landing craft enough time,2021-12-21
00:11:13.670,00:11:15.940,to depart without getting beached.,2021-12-21
00:11:15.940,00:11:17.900,The low water times were different,2021-12-21
00:11:17.900,00:11:20.710,"at the five landing beaches by over an hour,",2021-12-21
00:11:20.710,00:11:22.940,so the invasion times were staggered,2021-12-21
00:11:22.940,00:11:25.033,according to the tide predictions.,2021-12-21
00:11:26.950,00:11:29.270,- This wasn't the only use of analog computers,2021-12-21
00:11:29.270,00:11:30.560,in World War II.,2021-12-21
00:11:30.560,00:11:33.300,Dive bomber aircraft would plummet out of the sky,2021-12-21
00:11:33.300,00:11:37.000,"directly toward their targets at up to an 80 degree angle,",2021-12-21
00:11:37.000,00:11:38.480,and their rapid descents,2021-12-21
00:11:38.480,00:11:41.010,made them very difficult to shoot down.,2021-12-21
00:11:41.010,00:11:43.210,So the U.S. began searching for devices,2021-12-21
00:11:43.210,00:11:46.770,to automatically aim guns at dive bombers.,2021-12-21
00:11:46.770,00:11:48.250,Most of the proposed solutions,2021-12-21
00:11:48.250,00:11:50.540,fell into one of two categories.,2021-12-21
00:11:50.540,00:11:53.540,Some were analog machines like Lord Kelvin's.,2021-12-21
00:11:53.540,00:11:56.370,Others were essentially fast calculators.,2021-12-21
00:11:56.370,00:11:58.680,Mechanical calculating machines like the abacus,2021-12-21
00:11:58.680,00:12:00.150,"had been around for millennia,",2021-12-21
00:12:00.150,00:12:03.540,but they were far too slow to respond to dive bombers.,2021-12-21
00:12:03.540,00:12:05.930,These new calculating machines sped things up,2021-12-21
00:12:05.930,00:12:08.240,by using electrical pulses.,2021-12-21
00:12:08.240,00:12:10.340,The committee considered naming these devices,2021-12-21
00:12:10.340,00:12:12.200,after the pulses they used.,2021-12-21
00:12:12.200,00:12:13.570,But member George Stibitz,2021-12-21
00:12:13.570,00:12:16.910,"proposed a more general name: digital,",2021-12-21
00:12:16.910,00:12:20.070,because these machines operated on numbers themselves,2021-12-21
00:12:20.070,00:12:21.790,or digits.,2021-12-21
00:12:21.790,00:12:25.890,And this is the origin of the term digital computer.,2021-12-21
00:12:25.890,00:12:27.840,But digital would have to wait.,2021-12-21
00:12:27.840,00:12:30.360,Of all the proposals and innovative analog machine,2021-12-21
