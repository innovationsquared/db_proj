00:01:39.132,00:01:41.970,but I'll put his full presentation here.,2021-06-30
00:01:41.970,00:01:46.020,- So let me first explain what I see in the video.,2021-06-30
00:01:46.020,00:01:50.840,"In the video, the vehicle is operated in a gusty wind.",2021-06-30
00:01:50.840,00:01:55.430,"Initially, you have the wind speed exceeding the car speed,",2021-06-30
00:01:55.430,00:01:57.110,but then the wind speed is not constant.,2021-06-30
00:01:57.110,00:02:01.360,"The wind speed drops, and the car moves by inertia",2021-06-30
00:02:01.360,00:02:03.510,with deceleration for awhile.,2021-06-30
00:02:03.510,00:02:05.640,"- So, basically Alex thinks a gust",2021-06-30
00:02:05.640,00:02:07.240,pushes the car to a high speed.,2021-06-30
00:02:07.240,00:02:08.590,"And then when the wind dies,",2021-06-30
00:02:08.590,00:02:11.390,"the car is going faster than the wind momentarily,",2021-06-30
00:02:11.390,00:02:13.480,but it must be slowing down.,2021-06-30
00:02:13.480,00:02:14.850,"- In fact, that will be my conclusion",2021-06-30
00:02:14.850,00:02:16.330,"at the end of this presentation,",2021-06-30
00:02:16.330,00:02:18.900,"that whenever you have velocity faster than the wind,",2021-06-30
00:02:18.900,00:02:20.648,"I'll actually show you in an equation,",2021-06-30
00:02:20.648,00:02:22.030,the acceleration is negative.,2021-06-30
00:02:22.030,00:02:26.560,The second effect is that the wind in the video,2021-06-30
00:02:26.560,00:02:28.000,is measured at the height,2021-06-30
00:02:28.000,00:02:30.050,of about a meter or a meter and a half.,2021-06-30
00:02:30.050,00:02:32.400,But the propeller goes to some three meters,2021-06-30
00:02:32.400,00:02:33.233,above the ground.,2021-06-30
00:02:33.233,00:02:35.240,"- Now, due to interactions with the ground,",2021-06-30
00:02:35.240,00:02:37.090,there is a wind gradient.,2021-06-30
00:02:37.090,00:02:39.350,"Wind travels slower, close to the ground,",2021-06-30
00:02:39.350,00:02:41.310,"and then faster, higher up.",2021-06-30
00:02:41.310,00:02:43.590,"Now, Alex estimated that the wind speed of the propeller",2021-06-30
00:02:43.590,00:02:47.140,might be 10 or 15% higher than at the tell-tale.,2021-06-30
00:02:47.140,00:02:49.430,So it's possible that the car could be moving,2021-06-30
00:02:49.430,00:02:51.145,"slower than the wind at the propeller,",2021-06-30
00:02:51.145,00:02:53.681,and yet appear to be moving faster than the wind,2021-06-30
00:02:53.681,00:02:55.460,at the height of the tell-tale.,2021-06-30
00:02:55.460,00:02:57.890,"- Now, I think that this is a small effect.",2021-06-30
00:02:57.890,00:03:00.360,"However, in combination with the previous effect,",2021-06-30
00:03:00.360,00:03:03.152,"it just can make this more frequent, okay.",2021-06-30
00:03:03.152,00:03:04.950,And that completes-,2021-06-30
00:03:04.950,00:03:07.760,"- Alex, if I remember the video correctly,",2021-06-30
00:03:07.760,00:03:09.820,Derek reports that they've achieved,2021-06-30
00:03:09.820,00:03:12.920,up to 2.8 times wind speed.,2021-06-30
00:03:12.920,00:03:17.310,"That feels much higher than what is possible here,",2021-06-30
00:03:17.310,00:03:19.060,unless the wind had picked up,2021-06-30
00:03:19.060,00:03:21.639,and then spontaneously sort of dropped.,2021-06-30
00:03:21.639,00:03:22.900,"- Very, very good question.",2021-06-30
00:03:22.900,00:03:25.360,"Okay, if you're going for the record,",2021-06-30
00:03:25.360,00:03:27.970,you probably will do many attempts.,2021-06-30
00:03:27.970,00:03:29.947,You will be sampling that gusty wind,2021-06-30
00:03:29.947,00:03:32.150,"over, and over, and over,",2021-06-30
00:03:32.150,00:03:33.430,"until you set the record, right?",2021-06-30
00:03:33.430,00:03:34.613,That's how you set the record.,2021-06-30
00:03:34.613,00:03:37.400,"And on one of those occasions,",2021-06-30
00:03:37.400,00:03:39.021,"you will get a nice strong gust,",2021-06-30
00:03:39.021,00:03:43.020,"which is three times the air that comes after it, okay?",2021-06-30
00:03:43.020,00:03:45.550,And that's when you will clock the record.,2021-06-30
00:03:45.550,00:03:48.730,And that's where that 2.8 factor will come in.,2021-06-30
00:03:48.730,00:03:50.680,- So what about the treadmill tests?,2021-06-30
00:03:50.680,00:03:53.144,These are conducted in still air.,2021-06-30
00:03:53.144,00:03:55.430,"By moving the ground backwards,",2021-06-30
00:03:55.430,00:03:58.770,you're simulating a perfectly steady tailwind.,2021-06-30
00:03:58.770,00:04:01.800,"And if you hold the car stationary on the treadmill,",2021-06-30
00:04:01.800,00:04:05.550,"well, that's equivalent to the car going exactly wind speed.",2021-06-30
00:04:05.550,00:04:08.730,"Now, if the car can move forward on the treadmill,",2021-06-30
00:04:08.730,00:04:13.100,that shows it can accelerate faster than the wind.,2021-06-30
00:04:13.100,00:04:14.684,"But Alex had multiple explanations,",2021-06-30
00:04:14.684,00:04:17.440,why these experiments don't actually show,2021-06-30
00:04:17.440,00:04:19.050,what they claim to show.,2021-06-30
00:04:19.050,00:04:24.050,"- If you have this fluctuating speed of the treadmill,",2021-06-30
00:04:24.570,00:04:27.040,"and then if a human just sort of steers it,",2021-06-30
00:04:27.040,00:04:29.390,"it then can introduce unconsciously,",2021-06-30
00:04:29.390,00:04:31.880,a bias towards the desired result.,2021-06-30
00:04:31.880,00:04:35.550,"- So, would it any be that the guy with the spork",2021-06-30
00:04:35.550,00:04:38.190,is inducing the model craft,2021-06-30
00:04:38.190,00:04:40.837,to go across the lane now and then?,2021-06-30
00:04:40.837,00:04:44.926,"And as you pointed out, I would go downhill now and then.",2021-06-30
00:04:44.926,00:04:47.840,"- Yeah, I'm sure, I'm a hundred percent sure",2021-06-30
00:04:47.840,00:04:52.840,"that the guy in the video doesn't do it on purpose, okay.",2021-06-30
00:04:53.256,00:04:57.585,"However, you know, if he is expecting forward drift-",2021-06-30
00:04:57.585,00:04:58.696,"- Yeah, oh he's trying.",2021-06-30
00:04:58.696,00:05:01.750,"- Yeah, yeah absolutely, that's exactly, okay,",2021-06-30
00:05:01.750,00:05:02.870,so there you go.,2021-06-30
00:05:02.870,00:05:05.940,"- In the absence of convincing experimental evidence,",2021-06-30
00:05:05.940,00:05:08.280,"Alex turned to theoretical analyses,",2021-06-30
00:05:08.280,00:05:11.500,"like one by MIT Aero Professor, Mark Drela.",2021-06-30
00:05:11.500,00:05:14.210,"But here too, he found problems.",2021-06-30
00:05:14.210,00:05:16.610,His main concern is that the equation for net force,2021-06-30
00:05:16.610,00:05:19.350,includes the difference between the speeds of the car,2021-06-30
00:05:19.350,00:05:21.890,and the wind in the denominator.,2021-06-30
00:05:21.890,00:05:25.480,"Which seems to imply that when traveling exactly wind speed,",2021-06-30
00:05:25.480,00:05:27.600,you should get infinite force.,2021-06-30
00:05:27.600,00:05:29.410,"- Now, here's the real danger.",2021-06-30
00:05:29.410,00:05:33.310,"Because if Derek drives very close to the wind,",2021-06-30
00:05:33.310,00:05:36.530,that difference in speed goes to zero.,2021-06-30
00:05:36.530,00:05:39.200,"If it's one millionth of one percent,",2021-06-30
00:05:39.200,00:05:41.590,that's like a nuclear bomb exploding behind him.,2021-06-30
00:05:41.590,00:05:43.620,"Then Derek is definitely in trouble, right?",2021-06-30
00:05:43.620,00:05:46.960,So we need to find something to save Derek's life here.,2021-06-30
00:05:46.960,00:05:48.047,"This is serious, right?",2021-06-30
00:05:48.047,00:05:50.850,"- But dividing by zero, come on, you guys.",2021-06-30
00:05:50.850,00:05:51.969,I never looked at that.,2021-06-30
00:05:51.969,00:05:54.244,"- [Derek] Alex performed his own analysis,",2021-06-30
00:05:54.244,00:05:57.750,and found no such divide by zero problems.,2021-06-30
00:05:57.750,00:06:00.020,"In fact, he found there's no way for the car",2021-06-30
00:06:00.020,00:06:03.260,"to accelerate at, or above wind speed.",2021-06-30
00:06:03.260,00:06:06.380,- The acceleration of this craft is negative.,2021-06-30
00:06:06.380,00:06:08.150,"So when we, you know,",2021-06-30
00:06:08.150,00:06:10.360,"so it's possible to move the craft faster than the wind,",2021-06-30
00:06:10.360,00:06:13.110,but it's not possible to move it at zero acceleration,2021-06-30
00:06:13.110,00:06:16.640,which would be needed to maintain constant speed.,2021-06-30
00:06:16.640,00:06:18.390,- [Derek] That is basically where we left it.,2021-06-30
00:06:18.390,00:06:19.240,- That is right.,2021-06-30
00:06:19.240,00:06:20.653,"- Okay, thank you, thank you, Neil.",2021-06-30

00:06:22.433,00:06:25.593,- So now it was up to me to convince Professor Kusenko,2021-06-30
00:06:25.593,00:06:28.666,"that Blackbird really can go faster than the wind,",2021-06-30

00:10:22.471,00:10:25.148,is that the propeller doesn't work like most people think.,2021-06-30
00:10:25.148,00:10:26.750,It's not working like a windmill.,2021-06-30

00:10:30.158,00:10:32.568,"Instead, it turns in the opposite direction,",2021-06-30
00:10:32.568,00:10:35.538,working like a fan to push air backwards.,2021-06-30
00:10:35.538,00:10:37.598,"This fan is powered by the wheels,",2021-06-30
00:10:37.598,00:10:40.328,which are connected to the propeller by a bike chain.,2021-06-30
00:10:40.328,00:10:42.988,"So at wind speed, the car can keep accelerating",2021-06-30
00:10:42.988,00:10:46.138,"because the wheels turn the fan, which blows air back,",2021-06-30
00:10:46.138,00:10:48.448,generating forward thrust.,2021-06-30
00:10:48.448,00:10:50.798,"Now the big question is, to drive the fan,",2021-06-30
00:10:50.798,00:10:53.188,"there must be a backwards force on the wheels,",2021-06-30
00:10:53.188,00:10:55.138,which tends to slow them down.,2021-06-30
00:10:55.138,00:10:57.898,So why isn't this force bigger,2021-06-30
00:10:57.898,00:10:59.348,than the thrust from the propeller,2021-06-30
00:10:59.348,00:11:01.908,causing the car to slow down overall?,2021-06-30
00:11:01.908,00:11:03.238,"Well, the answer is,",2021-06-30
00:11:03.238,00:11:06.298,the wheels are going so much faster over the ground,2021-06-30
00:11:06.298,00:11:08.358,than the propeller is moving through the air.,2021-06-30
00:11:08.358,00:11:10.918,So the thrust force can actually be larger.,2021-06-30
00:11:10.918,00:11:12.248,I'm gonna do an analysis,2021-06-30
00:11:12.248,00:11:14.398,in the frame of reference of the car.,2021-06-30

00:11:42.648,00:11:44.778,The prop is going slower through the air,2021-06-30
00:11:44.778,00:11:46.348,due to the tailwind.,2021-06-30
00:11:46.348,00:11:47.968,"And if we assume no losses,",2021-06-30
00:11:47.968,00:11:49.658,"then the power in at the wheels,",2021-06-30
00:11:49.658,00:11:51.998,equals the power out at the propeller.,2021-06-30

00:11:52.988,00:11:54.725,we can see that the force at the propeller,2021-06-30
00:11:54.725,00:11:58.238,will be greater than the force at the wheels.,2021-06-30
00:11:58.238,00:12:00.365,"And since the propeller is pushing air back,",2021-06-30
00:12:00.365,00:12:03.468,the air applies an equal and opposite force,2021-06-30

00:13:37.638,00:13:40.186,that rolls on two smaller spools.,2021-06-30
00:13:40.186,00:13:41.977,And what I'm gonna show,2021-06-30
00:13:41.977,00:13:44.728,is that when you have two media,2021-06-30
00:13:44.728,00:13:46.598,"moving relative to one another,",2021-06-30
00:13:46.598,00:13:49.998,"well then if this car is in contact with both media,",2021-06-30
00:13:49.998,00:13:54.998,it can actually move faster than their relative velocity.,2021-06-30
00:13:55.068,00:13:59.059,"So as I push the board to the right,",2021-06-30
00:13:59.059,00:14:02.409,you can see that the car goes down the board,2021-06-30
00:14:02.409,00:14:04.601,faster than the board is moving.,2021-06-30
00:14:06.038,00:14:07.178,"If you look carefully,",2021-06-30
00:14:07.178,00:14:08.695,you'll see that the big wheel,2021-06-30
00:14:08.695,00:14:13.058,isn't turning the way that the board is pushing it.,2021-06-30
00:14:13.058,00:14:16.098,It's actually rotating in the opposite direction.,2021-06-30
00:14:16.098,00:14:18.596,"That's just like the propeller on Blackbird,",2021-06-30
00:14:18.596,00:14:21.868,"which pushes back against the air,",2021-06-30
00:14:21.868,00:14:24.158,and that's how it's able to go faster,2021-06-30
00:14:24.158,00:14:26.438,than the wind downwind.,2021-06-30
