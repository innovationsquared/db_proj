00:00:02.250,00:00:04.040,is surprisingly easy.,2021-09-03
00:00:04.040,00:00:06.670,All you need is an ultraviolet torch,2021-09-03
00:00:06.670,00:00:10.190,because scorpions are incredibly fluorescent.,2021-09-03
00:00:10.190,00:00:13.260,Fluorescence means their bodies absorb ultraviolet light,2021-09-03
00:00:13.260,00:00:16.000,and reradiate it in the visible part of the spectrum.,2021-09-03
00:00:16.000,00:00:19.210,They glow this bright neon green color.,2021-09-03
00:00:19.210,00:00:22.290,But scorpions aren't the only animals that fluoresce.,2021-09-03

00:01:00.530,00:01:02.810,It's a tongue depressor with a yellow highlighter on it.,2021-09-03
00:01:02.810,00:01:05.420,So it fluoresces in black light. So you can see where it is.,2021-09-03
00:01:05.420,00:01:06.315,- [Derek] Got it.,2021-09-03

00:01:14.913,00:01:16.810,- [Derek] That was impressive.,2021-09-03
00:01:16.810,00:01:18.610,All right. Should we give it a shot?,2021-09-03
00:01:24.000,00:01:26.420,- [Carl] Just gently pokes him back in.,2021-09-03
00:01:26.420,00:01:27.410,And they usually just kind of do a little,2021-09-03

00:01:36.270,00:01:38.300,All right. I'm going to get him.,2021-09-03
00:01:38.300,00:01:40.770,But why are scorpions fluorescent?,2021-09-03
00:01:40.770,00:01:42.310,- I've got about 12 hypotheses.,2021-09-03
00:01:42.310,00:01:44.360,So you test them one at a time.,2021-09-03
00:01:44.360,00:01:45.930,- [Derek] You've got 12 Hypotheses about why,2021-09-03
00:01:45.930,00:01:47.180,the scorpions fluoresce?,2021-09-03
00:01:47.180,00:01:49.570,"- More like six actually, I was being a little bit...",2021-09-03
00:01:49.570,00:01:51.880,Almost all scorpions fluoresce.,2021-09-03
00:01:51.880,00:01:52.990,"I haven't seen it myself,",2021-09-03
00:01:52.990,00:01:56.400,but some that live at living caves they don't fluoresce,2021-09-03
00:01:56.400,00:01:58.150,but it's only like one very small group.,2021-09-03
00:01:58.150,00:02:00.480,All the other scorpions fluoresce.,2021-09-03
00:02:00.480,00:02:03.230,"One possibility is just, this is a Relic Trait.",2021-09-03
00:02:03.230,00:02:04.680,It's something they developed way back,2021-09-03
00:02:04.680,00:02:08.160,when they first came out on land and just haven't lost.,2021-09-03
00:02:08.160,00:02:10.240,A chemical that has another function,2021-09-03
00:02:10.240,00:02:12.000,that just happens to fluoresce.,2021-09-03
00:02:12.000,00:02:13.920,There are plenty of chemicals that fluoresce.,2021-09-03
00:02:13.920,00:02:17.400,"I mean, we have internal bodily fluids that fluoresce.",2021-09-03
00:02:17.400,00:02:19.320,And clearly those are never exposed to UV light.,2021-09-03
00:02:19.320,00:02:20.630,So the idea of having a function,2021-09-03
00:02:20.630,00:02:22.855,for that fluorescence is kind of silly.,2021-09-03
00:02:22.855,00:02:24.610,"This fluoresce is about the same color as a scorpion,",2021-09-03
00:02:24.610,00:02:26.060,but clearly isn't a scorpion.,2021-09-03
00:02:26.060,00:02:27.280,It's actually a rock.,2021-09-03
00:02:27.280,00:02:28.733,The color is a little off.,2021-09-03
00:02:30.080,00:02:32.260,"- [Derek] But that is like, what is that?",2021-09-03
00:02:32.260,00:02:34.390,- It's plastic from Walpole.,2021-09-03
00:02:34.390,00:02:35.250,- [Derek] Huh.,2021-09-03
00:02:35.250,00:02:37.810,You anted to know if the scorpions were fluorescing,2021-09-03
00:02:37.810,00:02:40.020,in order to attract insects.,2021-09-03
00:02:40.020,00:02:40.853,- Right.,2021-09-03
00:02:40.853,00:02:41.686,- [Narrator] So how did you test that?,2021-09-03
00:02:41.686,00:02:44.400,- What I did was I used preserved scorpions like these ones,2021-09-03
00:02:44.400,00:02:47.510,and I took half of them and dip them in,2021-09-03
00:02:47.510,00:02:50.370,UV blocking marine varnish so they didn't fluoresce.,2021-09-03
00:02:50.370,00:02:53.070,And then I just used basically flypaper,2021-09-03
00:02:53.070,00:02:55.730,and took those things outside and set them side by side,2021-09-03
00:02:55.730,00:02:58.910,and then found the number of flying insects,2021-09-03
00:02:58.910,00:03:00.854,that were caught in each.,2021-09-03
00:03:00.854,00:03:01.687,- [Derek] Okay.,2021-09-03
00:03:01.687,00:03:03.330,- [Carl] So we were outside in moonlight,2021-09-03
00:03:03.330,00:03:04.870,"and I did the same experiment,",2021-09-03
00:03:04.870,00:03:06.860,both under the new moon and the full moon.,2021-09-03
00:03:06.860,00:03:08.400,And so what I found from that was,2021-09-03
00:03:08.400,00:03:09.730,"when there was a new moon,",2021-09-03
00:03:09.730,00:03:11.000,there was no difference in the number,2021-09-03
00:03:11.000,00:03:12.590,of insects caught by the fluorescent,2021-09-03
00:03:12.590,00:03:13.860,and non-fluorescent scorpions.,2021-09-03
00:03:13.860,00:03:16.400,"But under the full moon, there's nice, bright UV light",2021-09-03
00:03:16.400,00:03:17.840,available there was a difference,2021-09-03
00:03:17.840,00:03:20.970,and the ones that fluoresce actually caught fewer insects.,2021-09-03
00:03:20.970,00:03:22.480,- It seems kind of counterintuitive.,2021-09-03
00:03:22.480,00:03:24.910,- So that tells me that my hypothesis was wrong.,2021-09-03
00:03:24.910,00:03:26.290,Which happens a lot.,2021-09-03
00:03:26.290,00:03:27.950,"Basically yeah, they're not using",2021-09-03
00:03:27.950,00:03:29.550,their fluorescence to lure insects.,2021-09-03
00:03:29.550,00:03:31.880,"In fact, the fluorescence is a bad thing for them in terms",2021-09-03
00:03:31.880,00:03:35.130,"of their ability to catch flying insects, at least.",2021-09-03
00:03:35.130,00:03:36.300,- Let me ask you this.,2021-09-03
00:03:36.300,00:03:39.240,If you find that fluorescence is counterproductive,2021-09-03
00:03:39.240,00:03:41.080,"for the scorpion in some way,",2021-09-03
00:03:41.080,00:03:42.250,doesn't that indicate that there,2021-09-03
00:03:42.250,00:03:44.210,has to be something useful?,2021-09-03
00:03:44.210,00:03:47.000,- Exactly. There must be something that counteracts that.,2021-09-03
00:03:47.000,00:03:47.833,- Sort of negative.,2021-09-03
00:03:47.833,00:03:48.850,"- That negative, yeah.",2021-09-03
00:03:48.850,00:03:51.390,Scorpions are really well adapted for what they do.,2021-09-03
00:03:51.390,00:03:54.130,One of the cool things here is it scorpions,2021-09-03
00:03:54.130,00:03:59.030,are actually able to metabolize iron and nickel.,2021-09-03
00:03:59.030,00:04:02.610,And in their pincer here,2021-09-03
00:04:02.610,00:04:04.020,"and on the tips of their claws,",2021-09-03
00:04:04.020,00:04:07.323,they actually have basically iron to strengthen that.,2021-09-03
00:04:07.323,00:04:10.410,- [Derek] Iron and nickel at the end of their tail?,2021-09-03
00:04:10.410,00:04:11.690,- [Carl] Yeah. Yeah.,2021-09-03
00:04:11.690,00:04:13.980,You can see like the color here's a little bit different,2021-09-03
00:04:13.980,00:04:16.210,and that's because of the iron.,2021-09-03
00:04:16.210,00:04:19.140,- [Derek] That seems very aggressive to me.,2021-09-03
00:04:19.140,00:04:20.820,One of the main things we're interested in here,2021-09-03
00:04:20.820,00:04:21.940,is how they see.,2021-09-03
00:04:21.940,00:04:24.010,So I've seen two of their eyes.,2021-09-03
00:04:24.010,00:04:26.970,"- [Carl] So, those are the median eyes right there.",2021-09-03
00:04:26.970,00:04:28.220,- [Derek] Those two dark spots.,2021-09-03
00:04:28.220,00:04:30.070,- [Carl] Yeah. There's a cluster of three eyes right there.,2021-09-03
00:04:30.070,00:04:32.210,"And of course on the other side, so they're symmetrical.",2021-09-03
00:04:32.210,00:04:33.940,So they have a total of eight eyes.,2021-09-03
00:04:33.940,00:04:36.990,- Can they detect the light with parts of their body,2021-09-03
00:04:36.990,00:04:38.400,that are not eyes?,2021-09-03
00:04:38.400,00:04:40.330,- Yeah. Actually they can.,2021-09-03
00:04:40.330,00:04:42.170,"- [Derek] In a 1968 experiment,",2021-09-03
00:04:42.170,00:04:45.780,researchers put scorpions in half covered Petri dishes.,2021-09-03
00:04:45.780,00:04:49.180,Then they exposed them to bright light and all the scorpions,2021-09-03
00:04:49.180,00:04:52.015,quickly hid under the covered part of the Petri dish.,2021-09-03
00:04:52.015,00:04:55.990,Then the researchers painted over the eyes of the scorpions.,2021-09-03
00:04:55.990,00:04:59.490,So they couldn't see and repeated the experiment.,2021-09-03
00:04:59.490,00:05:02.940,"But when they turned on the light, 93% of the time,",2021-09-03
00:05:02.940,00:05:05.630,the blinded scorpions still scuttled over,2021-09-03
00:05:05.630,00:05:07.260,to the covered side.,2021-09-03
00:05:07.260,00:05:09.510,The finding was remarkable.,2021-09-03
00:05:09.510,00:05:12.220,Scorpions don't need their eyes to detect light.,2021-09-03
00:05:12.220,00:05:14.420,They can sense it with their bodies.,2021-09-03
00:05:14.420,00:05:15.640,- That showed that they have what's called,2021-09-03
00:05:15.640,00:05:18.430,an extra ocular light sense in their tail.,2021-09-03
00:05:18.430,00:05:20.620,So they can detect light with their tail.,2021-09-03
00:05:20.620,00:05:21.960,"They can't form images, they can't,",2021-09-03
00:05:21.960,00:05:23.680,but they can detect light.,2021-09-03
00:05:23.680,00:05:26.720,- The tail of a scorpion can detect light?,2021-09-03
00:05:26.720,00:05:28.500,- One hypothesis is that they use it,2021-09-03
00:05:28.500,00:05:30.100,to communicate with one another.,2021-09-03
00:05:31.555,00:05:33.620,The idea being that they use it to determine,2021-09-03
00:05:33.620,00:05:35.350,primarily whether or not,2021-09-03
00:05:35.350,00:05:36.870,another scorpion out there,2021-09-03
00:05:36.870,00:05:39.240,is of the same species for mating.,2021-09-03
00:05:39.240,00:05:41.930,One fairly low probability hypothesis,2021-09-03
00:05:41.930,00:05:44.380,is that they can use it as camouflage,2021-09-03
00:05:44.380,00:05:46.997,because they absorb UV light.,2021-09-03
00:05:46.997,00:05:49.800,If they're sitting on another surface that absorbs UV light,2021-09-03
00:05:49.800,00:05:51.610,and you have an organism that sees in the UV light,2021-09-03
00:05:51.610,00:05:53.960,"like some owls and things like that can do,",2021-09-03
00:05:53.960,00:05:56.390,they would tend to blend in very nicely with that.,2021-09-03
00:05:56.390,00:05:58.140,"So it's a possibility,",2021-09-03
00:05:58.140,00:06:01.070,but not that many organisms see in UV,2021-09-03
00:06:01.070,00:06:03.810,"and not that many that eat scorpion, see in UV",2021-09-03
00:06:03.810,00:06:05.453,so it doesn't seem very likely.,2021-09-03
00:06:09.170,00:06:10.400,- [Derek] You go for it.,2021-09-03
00:06:10.400,00:06:11.233,- [Carl] You want me to do it upclose?,2021-09-03
00:06:11.233,00:06:12.066,- [Narrator] You do it.,2021-09-03

00:06:13.090,00:06:14.800,Here you go. See?,2021-09-03
00:06:14.800,00:06:16.910,"There you go, wow.",2021-09-03
00:06:16.910,00:06:19.590,- One of the ideas is scorpions came out of the water,2021-09-03
00:06:19.590,00:06:22.160,from Silurian period long time ago.,2021-09-03
00:06:22.160,00:06:25.360,And there was a lot more UV just in sunlight,2021-09-03
00:06:25.360,00:06:26.790,"and things like that then, because we didn't have",2021-09-03
00:06:26.790,00:06:28.010,"an ozone layer, we didn't have, you know,",2021-09-03
00:06:28.010,00:06:30.190,all these things that are blocking UV in our atmosphere now.,2021-09-03
00:06:30.190,00:06:31.740,And so the one of the idea is that,2021-09-03
00:06:31.740,00:06:33.460,it actually acts as a sunscreen.,2021-09-03
00:06:33.460,00:06:38.132,It's way to absorb those damaging ultraviolet photons,2021-09-03
00:06:38.132,00:06:40.860,and convert them away into something,2021-09-03
00:06:40.860,00:06:43.140,and basically keep them from penetrating into the body,2021-09-03
00:06:43.140,00:06:45.220,and causing damage.,2021-09-03
00:06:45.220,00:06:46.520,- [Derek] Go in your hole.,2021-09-03
00:06:47.732,00:06:49.093,There you go.,2021-09-03
00:06:50.140,00:06:50.973,You got him.,2021-09-03
00:06:50.973,00:06:52.840,- And then there have been some other ones,2021-09-03
00:06:52.840,00:06:54.400,that are a little bit more out there.,2021-09-03
00:06:54.400,00:06:56.877,One of which being the one that I actually,2021-09-03
00:06:56.877,00:06:59.120,settled on at the end is that they use it,2021-09-03
00:06:59.120,00:07:01.350,as part of their sensory system to detect the presence,2021-09-03
00:07:01.350,00:07:03.250,of light in the environment.,2021-09-03
00:07:03.250,00:07:04.980,So this was the later experiment after I gave up,2021-09-03
00:07:04.980,00:07:08.010,on the initial idea that said that didn't work.,2021-09-03
00:07:08.010,00:07:10.520,"So, all I really did in that one, very simple,",2021-09-03
00:07:10.520,00:07:14.110,put a scorpion in each one of these things here,2021-09-03
00:07:14.110,00:07:17.060,and then put this under ultraviolet light,2021-09-03
00:07:17.060,00:07:18.600,and exposed it to ultraviolet light.,2021-09-03
00:07:18.600,00:07:21.410,And so I measured how long they spent exposed,2021-09-03
00:07:21.410,00:07:23.110,versus unexposed and how many times,2021-09-03
00:07:23.110,00:07:24.690,they went back and forth.,2021-09-03
00:07:24.690,00:07:26.040,- [Derek] And you were testing scorpions,2021-09-03
00:07:26.040,00:07:28.100,that were fluorescent and not fluorescent.,2021-09-03
00:07:28.100,00:07:28.933,- [Carl] Right.,2021-09-03
00:07:28.933,00:07:30.520,So what I did with that was I developed,2021-09-03
00:07:30.520,00:07:33.377,"a technique to remove, or at least reduce",2021-09-03
00:07:33.377,00:07:35.550,the ability of scorpions to fluoresce,2021-09-03
00:07:35.550,00:07:37.440,simply by exposing them for long periods,2021-09-03
00:07:37.440,00:07:38.950,of time to ultraviolet light.,2021-09-03
00:07:38.950,00:07:41.390,"So basically, you're just kind of taking the chemical",2021-09-03
00:07:41.390,00:07:44.070,that is causing fluorescence in their exoskeleton,2021-09-03
00:07:44.070,00:07:46.060,and your photo bleaching.,2021-09-03
00:07:46.060,00:07:47.304,- [Derek] So you're kind of breaking it down?,2021-09-03
00:07:47.304,00:07:48.137,"- [Carl] So basically, you're making the chemical",2021-09-03
00:07:48.137,00:07:49.680,not be able to function properly anymore.,2021-09-03
00:07:49.680,00:07:53.560,What we found is the activity levels changed significantly.,2021-09-03
00:07:53.560,00:07:55.390,"So when you exposed to UV light,",2021-09-03
00:07:55.390,00:07:57.270,the non-fluorescence scorpions acted like,2021-09-03
00:07:57.270,00:07:58.880,they were in the dark.,2021-09-03
00:07:58.880,00:08:00.460,There was no difference between their behavior,2021-09-03
00:08:00.460,00:08:01.920,and the dark and in UV light.,2021-09-03
00:08:01.920,00:08:03.580,Whereas when UV light was present for the ones,2021-09-03
00:08:03.580,00:08:06.510,"that can fluoresce, they reduced their activity levels.",2021-09-03
00:08:06.510,00:08:08.450,- [Derek] What's the conclusion from that?,2021-09-03
00:08:08.450,00:08:09.350,- [Carl] The conclusion from that,2021-09-03
00:08:09.350,00:08:12.870,"is that the fluorescents itself is acting as a way to,",2021-09-03
00:08:12.870,00:08:16.240,for them to detect the presence of ultraviolet light.,2021-09-03
00:08:16.240,00:08:20.390,"Another researcher by the name of Douglas Gaffin,",2021-09-03
00:08:20.390,00:08:21.610,came up with a great phrase for it.,2021-09-03
00:08:21.610,00:08:24.170,"I wish I'd come up with the phrase, but I gotta give credit.",2021-09-03
00:08:24.170,00:08:26.840,"He calls it, a whole-body photon detector.",2021-09-03
00:08:26.840,00:08:29.490,So it's part of their sensory system.,2021-09-03
00:08:29.490,00:08:31.670,What we don't know is why they want,2021-09-03
00:08:31.670,00:08:33.210,to detect ultraviolet light so badly,2021-09-03
00:08:33.210,00:08:35.710,that they've turned their whole body into a photon detector.,2021-09-03
00:08:35.710,00:08:38.780,The suspicion is that it has to do with determining,2021-09-03
00:08:39.940,00:08:41.960,whether or not they should come out at night.,2021-09-03
00:08:41.960,00:08:44.140,- [Derek] The idea is when UV light hits,2021-09-03
00:08:44.140,00:08:48.100,"a scorpion's body, it fluoresces and the tail detects",2021-09-03
00:08:48.100,00:08:51.100,this emitted green light alerting the scorpion,2021-09-03
00:08:51.100,00:08:54.360,that it is exposed so it searches for cover.,2021-09-03
00:08:54.360,00:08:55.348,- [Carl] Scorpions are good at starving,2021-09-03
00:08:55.348,00:08:56.670,for long periods of time.,2021-09-03
00:08:56.670,00:08:58.640,They don't need to eat that often.,2021-09-03
00:08:58.640,00:09:01.508,And coming out and foraging is dangerous for them.,2021-09-03
00:09:01.508,00:09:03.220,And so they don't like to come out,2021-09-03
00:09:03.220,00:09:04.520,when it's a moonlit night.,2021-09-03
00:09:04.520,00:09:06.420,Typically the only ones you'll find out in the full moon,2021-09-03
00:09:06.420,00:09:08.620,"are the ones that are really hungry, really need food.",2021-09-03
00:09:08.620,00:09:10.280,"If they're well fed, they'll stay down.",2021-09-03
00:09:10.280,00:09:12.360,So they're using that as basically their cue,2021-09-03
00:09:12.360,00:09:13.720,"in the environment and saying, you know,",2021-09-03
00:09:13.720,00:09:14.980,"okay, this is how bright it is.",2021-09-03
00:09:14.980,00:09:17.800,So that's a cue as to how likely I'm being preyed upon.,2021-09-03
00:09:17.800,00:09:19.460,And then here's how hungry I am.,2021-09-03
00:09:19.460,00:09:22.203,That's a cue how badly I need to get out and get some food.,2021-09-03
00:09:22.203,00:09:23.036,- [Derek] Right.,2021-09-03
00:09:23.036,00:09:23.869,- [Dr. Carl] And then the trade off between those two,2021-09-03
00:09:23.869,00:09:25.460,is basically should I go out tonight,2021-09-03
00:09:25.460,00:09:26.840,or should I stay in my hole.,2021-09-03
00:09:26.840,00:09:27.910,- [Derek] Yeah.,2021-09-03
