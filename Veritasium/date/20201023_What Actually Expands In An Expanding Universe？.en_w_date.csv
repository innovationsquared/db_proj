00:00:07.359,00:00:12.460,The first piece of evidence that showed our universe is expanding came in the light from,2020-10-23
00:00:12.460,00:00:14.280,distant galaxies.,2020-10-23
00:00:14.280,00:00:17.589,If you look at the spectrum of the sun you see these dark lines.,2020-10-23
00:00:17.589,00:00:23.599,And we see those lines in the spectra from galaxies except they are shitfed to longer,2020-10-23
00:00:23.599,00:00:27.019,"wavelengths, towards the red end of the spectrum.",2020-10-23
00:00:27.019,00:00:31.220,So we say their light is red-shifted.,2020-10-23
00:00:31.220,00:00:35.780,Now the usual explanation for this redshift is that: as the light is traveling through,2020-10-23

00:00:43.480,00:00:46.300,This is known as cosmological redshift.,2020-10-23
00:00:46.300,00:00:50.430,The explanation is fairly intuitively satisfying and most people go on without giving it a,2020-10-23

00:01:17.470,00:01:23.350,To answer these questions we’ve got to take a closer look at what it really means to redshift.,2020-10-23

00:01:54.180,00:01:57.310,so how does each redshift actually occur?,2020-10-23
00:01:57.310,00:02:00.850,Let’s start with a photon in a gravitational field.,2020-10-23
00:02:00.850,00:02:06.510,There is this famous experiment conducted in 1959 by Pound and Rebka sending photons,2020-10-23
00:02:06.510,00:02:09.360,up and down a 22m tower at Harvard.,2020-10-23
00:02:09.360,00:02:14.060,"Now, they used gamma rays but I’ll represent them with visible light.",2020-10-23
00:02:14.060,00:02:18.900,They found that photons detected at the top of the tower were red-shifted relative to,2020-10-23
00:02:18.900,00:02:19.900,the source,2020-10-23
00:02:19.900,00:02:26.230,by the exact amount predicted by General Relativity (which is a tiny amount - I’m dramatically,2020-10-23
00:02:26.230,00:02:29.700,exaggerating the effect so you can see it).,2020-10-23
00:02:29.700,00:02:33.230,Now where along the photon’s path does this redshift take place?,2020-10-23
00:02:33.230,00:02:36.739,Well it seems to happen continuously.,2020-10-23
00:02:36.739,00:02:43.060,"The photon loses a little bit of energy, each millimeter it climbs up that tower.",2020-10-23
00:02:43.060,00:02:47.850,Meaning that the photon in the middle of the tower would appear green.,2020-10-23
00:02:47.850,00:02:52.300,"Now according to Einstein’s equivalence principle, being at rest on Earth’s surface",2020-10-23
00:02:52.300,00:02:58.830,is indistinguishable from being in a rocket in deep space accelerating up at 1g.,2020-10-23
00:02:58.830,00:03:04.569,So we could do the same experiment in a rocketship and we should get the same result.,2020-10-23
00:03:04.569,00:03:09.660,If we send blue photons from the back of the rocket they should be red when they reach,2020-10-23
00:03:09.660,00:03:10.790,the front.,2020-10-23
00:03:10.790,00:03:13.550,And in the middle of the ship they would be green.,2020-10-23
00:03:13.550,00:03:19.640,This is exactly what we saw at rest in a gravitational field so the equivalence principle holds.,2020-10-23
00:03:19.640,00:03:26.340,Now imagine there are a line of external observers just hanging out in space at rest relative,2020-10-23
00:03:26.340,00:03:29.790,to each other and they can all see into the rocket.,2020-10-23
00:03:29.790,00:03:34.940,Let’s also say the rocket is initially at rest and the thrusters are switched on the,2020-10-23
00:03:34.940,00:03:37.319,instant the photon is released.,2020-10-23
00:03:37.319,00:03:41.360,"Now since both observers are at rest at this moment, they will both measure the photon",2020-10-23
00:03:41.360,00:03:44.480,as having the exact same wavelength - it’s blue.,2020-10-23
00:03:44.480,00:03:47.250,But what about when the photon reaches the middle of the rocket?,2020-10-23
00:03:47.250,00:03:50.739,Well we know someone inside will see it as green.,2020-10-23
00:03:50.739,00:03:53.990,But what about a stationary observer outside?,2020-10-23
00:03:53.990,00:03:58.790,"Well to them the photon has just been moving through ordinary flat spacetime,",2020-10-23
00:03:58.790,00:04:04.080,so it must look blue - just as blue as it was when it was emitted.,2020-10-23
00:04:04.080,00:04:05.500,So what’s the deal?,2020-10-23
00:04:05.500,00:04:10.909,How can the same photon look green and blue at the same time?,2020-10-23
00:04:10.909,00:04:13.690,Has the equivalence principle been violated?,2020-10-23
00:04:13.690,00:04:15.890,The answer is no.,2020-10-23
00:04:15.890,00:04:20.489,"It matters a lot to this measurement, who is doing the observation.",2020-10-23
00:04:20.489,00:04:25.150,"Consider this: after the photon is emitted the rocket accelerates, it's speeding up",2020-10-23
00:04:25.150,00:04:30.710,"so by the time the photon reaches the middle of the rocket, everyone inside is moving at",2020-10-23
00:04:30.710,00:04:34.460,high velocity relative to the source when the light was emitted,2020-10-23
00:04:34.460,00:04:37.560,and relative to the observers outside the rocket.,2020-10-23
00:04:37.560,00:04:42.240,So it makes sense that the photon as measured inside will look different - it'll be redshifted,2020-10-23
00:04:42.240,00:04:43.240,-,2020-10-23
00:04:43.240,00:04:47.800,this is the Doppler redshift because the observer in the middle of the ship is moving very quickly,2020-10-23
00:04:47.800,00:04:49.860,away from the source.,2020-10-23
00:04:49.860,00:04:53.930,"By the time the photon makes it to the top of the rocket, the rocket will be going even",2020-10-23
00:04:53.930,00:04:57.310,"faster and this is why it appears red,",2020-10-23
00:04:57.310,00:05:03.000,"but to a stationary observer outside, well it still looks blue.",2020-10-23
00:05:03.000,00:05:08.960,This thought experiment shows us that wavelength and energy are not intrinsic properties of,2020-10-23
00:05:08.960,00:05:09.960,photons.,2020-10-23
00:05:09.960,00:05:13.660,They are properties of the photon-observer system.,2020-10-23
00:05:13.660,00:05:17.630,Now let’s recreate the Harvard tower experiment.,2020-10-23
00:05:17.630,00:05:20.900,Observers in the building see the photon redshifted as it climbs.,2020-10-23
00:05:20.900,00:05:27.110,But here’s a question for you: what would a free-falling observer see?,2020-10-23
00:05:27.110,00:05:32.169,"Well they would be just like the stationary observers in space, watching the rocket accelerate",2020-10-23

00:05:33.430,00:05:36.240,The physics of these two situations are identical!,2020-10-23
00:05:36.240,00:05:43.460,So they would measure no redshift - to them the photon would look blue the whole time.,2020-10-23
00:05:43.460,00:05:47.360,What I want to show is that there aren’t actually three different types of redshifts,2020-10-23
00:05:47.360,00:05:49.240,- there is only one.,2020-10-23
00:05:49.240,00:05:53.979,"We’ve seen that gravitational redshift, can equivalently be seen as a doppler redshift",2020-10-23
00:05:53.979,00:05:58.100,when we do the same analysis in an accelerating rocket ship.,2020-10-23
00:05:58.100,00:06:00.650,So what about cosmological redshift?,2020-10-23
00:06:00.650,00:06:08.280,"Well, for this we have to zoom waaaay out - past our solar system, the milky way galaxy,",2020-10-23

00:06:28.289,00:06:32.949,"And just as you don’t notice the individual molecules in a cup of water, at this scale",2020-10-23
00:06:32.949,00:06:36.330,we don’t notice individual galaxies in the cosmic fluid.,2020-10-23
00:06:36.330,00:06:42.300,"And the cosmic fluid looks the same in every direction, there is no preferred orientation",2020-10-23
00:06:42.300,00:06:45.730,- it’s said to be isotropic.,2020-10-23
00:06:45.730,00:06:50.310,Now what you’ll notice is that the cosmic fluid is spreading out.,2020-10-23

00:07:00.380,00:07:04.580,And this is the basic property of an expanding universe.,2020-10-23
00:07:04.580,00:07:07.110,We can draw some coordinates on the universe.,2020-10-23

00:07:16.729,00:07:22.090,So there will be certain observers whose coordinates don’t change over time.,2020-10-23
00:07:22.090,00:07:28.310,And these are known as co-moving observers - they are at rest with respect to the cosmic,2020-10-23

00:07:29.360,00:07:32.960,By the way on Earth we are not a co-moving observer.,2020-10-23
00:07:32.960,00:07:39.509,Our galaxy is moving at 600 km/s relative to the cosmic microwave background radiation.,2020-10-23
00:07:39.509,00:07:44.940,Now let’s pick two co-moving observers a large distance apart and have them exchange,2020-10-23
