00:00:06.240,00:00:09.060,I'm floating in shade balls!,2019-06-13
00:00:09.060,00:00:12.840,This feels incredible because like I can hardly,2019-06-13
00:00:12.840,00:00:14.360,tell there's water under me.,2019-06-13
00:00:14.360,00:00:16.140,It feels like just being in a ball pit.,2019-06-13
00:00:19.280,00:00:21.280,But it's kind of like quicksand,2019-06-13
00:00:21.280,00:00:22.780,Oh no!,2019-06-13
00:00:22.780,00:00:23.460,Uh oh!,2019-06-13
00:00:24.280,00:00:28.140,I feel like this is the Internet's fault because I made this video about the,2019-06-13
00:00:28.140,00:00:34.100,shade balls on LA reservoir and a lot of people asked: can you swim in shade balls?,2019-06-13
00:00:34.100,00:00:39.640,"and I'm like it's a drinking reservoir, obviously you can't swim in the drinking water",2019-06-13
00:00:39.640,00:00:43.590,but then I thought you know what we know the people who actually made,2019-06-13
00:00:43.590,00:00:47.489,these shade balls and so I could call them up and order them and sure enough,2019-06-13
00:00:47.489,00:00:51.000,"I've purchased 10,000 shade balls to try to swim in.",2019-06-13
00:00:51.000,00:00:53.399,Now there is a scientific and,2019-06-13
00:00:53.399,00:00:56.670,safe way to test this which would be to go in the shallow end but I'm gonna do,2019-06-13
00:00:56.670,00:01:01.400,the YouTube way which is to jump in the deep end and just see if I can swim,2019-06-13
00:01:01.400,00:01:03.400,In 3... 2... 1...,2019-06-13
00:01:11.120,00:01:15.640,it was probably right about now that I thought back to my conversation with the,2019-06-13
00:01:15.640,00:01:19.719,Shay ball manufacturer you don't recommend swimming and shake balls so do,2019-06-13
00:01:19.719,00:01:23.860,you think it's a bit dangerous maybe so dangerous in fact that he regularly,2019-06-13
00:01:23.860,00:01:28.149,refuses requests from residential customers they didn't even want to sell,2019-06-13
00:01:28.149,00:01:32.590,me shade balls I appreciate you making an exception for our Channel and for,2019-06-13
00:01:32.590,00:01:36.429,science and we will not promote this as a thing that people should do we will,2019-06-13
00:01:36.429,00:01:39.880,show people what it what happens and therefore that they should probably not,2019-06-13
00:01:39.880,00:01:42.369,do it what makes shade balls inherently more,2019-06-13
00:01:42.369,00:01:45.939,dangerous than other plastic balls is that they're half-full of water so,2019-06-13
00:01:45.939,00:01:49.090,"they're heavy this bag of 1,200 shaped balls weighs",2019-06-13
00:01:49.090,00:01:55.060,"300 kilograms or 660 pounds so when I ordered 10,000 of these things I didn't",2019-06-13
00:01:55.060,00:01:57.879,really think about how hard it would be to get them home and now we have them,2019-06-13
00:01:57.879,00:02:01.379,all in the back of u-haul now the only challenge get in the mouth,2019-06-13
00:02:01.379,00:02:06.340,after driving the largest vehicle I've ever attempted across LA I hired a,2019-06-13
00:02:06.340,00:02:08.700,moving company,2019-06-13
00:02:13.410,00:02:19.050,it's time to release the balls,2019-06-13
00:02:38.959,00:02:42.989,"kind of surprised 6,000 shape balls doesn't quite cover the whole pool but",2019-06-13
00:02:42.989,00:02:47.040,it's it's just about there and you can see already the balls have sort of,2019-06-13
00:02:47.040,00:02:53.040,arranged themselves in crystal structures for their clothes packed and,2019-06-13
00:02:53.040,00:02:56.370,then there's some boundaries between these grains we've basically got a,2019-06-13
00:02:56.370,00:03:01.019,single layer of balls on the whole pool I'm gonna jump in and try to swim with,2019-06-13
00:03:01.019,00:03:09.599,"them we'll see how that works and if I can do that then we have 3,600 more and",2019-06-13
00:03:09.599,00:03:27.970,we can put on top which brings us back to what,2019-06-13
00:03:29.849,00:03:35.349,I'm swimming,2019-06-13
00:03:36.240,00:03:40.709,so this is breast rate and on,2019-06-13
00:03:40.709,00:03:51.689,I can swim but I am getting a lot of balls into the face a few observations,2019-06-13
00:03:51.689,00:03:56.250,for objects whose purpose is to block out sunlight a surprising amount still,2019-06-13
00:03:56.250,00:04:01.109,gets through that's because even packed as tightly as possible Spears only cover,2019-06-13
00:04:01.109,00:04:06.780,about 91% of the water surface light coming through the cracks and reflecting,2019-06-13
00:04:06.780,00:04:10.290,off the balls makes these really interesting patterns on the bottom of,2019-06-13
00:04:10.290,00:04:17.130,the pool when swimming through shaped balls the other thing that hits you is,2019-06-13
00:04:17.130,00:04:23.190,the noise they make so much noise so close to your head that it's virtually,2019-06-13
00:04:23.190,00:04:30.690,impossible to hear anything else I feel like you're getting an extra workout,2019-06-13
00:04:30.690,00:04:35.970,frankly I'm gonna try a different swim stroke I'm gonna go over to front crawl,2019-06-13
00:04:35.970,00:04:42.770,or freestyle,2019-06-13
00:04:42.770,00:04:48.280,ah I feel like I got like a bloody lip I,2019-06-13
00:04:53.050,00:04:57.710,feel like I'm getting knocked around like in a rock tumbler swimming in shape,2019-06-13
00:04:57.710,00:05:02.150,balls made me reflect on drag the force that opposes motion when moving through,2019-06-13
00:05:02.150,00:05:07.840,a fluid drag is typically proportional to your velocity squared why is that,2019-06-13
00:05:07.840,00:05:13.069,well let's imagine these shaped balls as particles of their own fluid and the,2019-06-13
00:05:13.069,00:05:18.229,faster you go the more of them you encounter per second but also the faster,2019-06-13
00:05:18.229,00:05:22.460,they're moving relative to you and hence the impact they have on you as you push,2019-06-13
00:05:22.460,00:05:26.569,them out of the way so that's why drag is proportional to V squared because you,2019-06-13
00:05:26.569,00:05:30.800,run into more of them and they're moving faster relative to you so they have a,2019-06-13
00:05:30.800,00:05:35.419,greater impact swimming is a good workout swimming you shade balls next,2019-06-13
00:05:35.419,00:05:40.520,level next level so I'm not actually the best swimmer so I brought over some,2019-06-13
00:05:40.520,00:05:50.060,friends Christian and Jorden butterfly is even more challenging because not,2019-06-13
00:05:50.060,00:05:54.139,only do you have to push the balls forward they also get pushed down and up,2019-06-13
00:05:54.139,00:05:56.740,and out,2019-06-13
00:06:14.970,00:06:23.080,however that's insane it looks hard you can hit your face with your shoulders so,2019-06-13
00:06:23.080,00:06:27.130,with it clear that you can swim albeit with difficulty in a single layer of,2019-06-13
00:06:27.130,00:06:33.120,shaved balls it was time to test if you can swim in multi layer shade balls,2019-06-13
00:06:46.090,00:06:51.870,this is in fact how most of la reservoir is covered,2019-06-13
00:06:53.659,00:06:58.919,it looks as though you could like float on the top so I'm gonna see if I can,2019-06-13
00:06:58.919,00:07:07.069,like run across these shape balls it's gonna end poorly I'm sure three two one,2019-06-13
00:07:17.040,00:07:22.180,similar attempts to slide across the surface of the shade balls were also,2019-06-13
00:07:22.180,00:07:25.230,doomed to failure,2019-06-13
00:07:26.970,00:07:32.640,each ball is almost half full of water so when fully submerged it only supports,2019-06-13
00:07:32.640,00:07:37.530,around 300 grams that means to support my body entirely above the water I'd,2019-06-13
00:07:37.530,00:07:53.940,need more than 260 shade balls trapped under mine this is amazing I'm still I'm,2019-06-13
00:07:53.940,00:08:00.960,still but what about the central question can you swim in multiple layers,2019-06-13
00:08:00.960,00:08:03.650,of shade,2019-06-13
00:08:09.050,00:08:18.020,I don't think you can swim until I found the kind of unorthodox style swimming,2019-06-13
00:08:18.020,00:08:31.970,mostly beneath the shade balls just like the guy in the boat said you just don't,2019-06-13
00:08:31.970,00:08:40.520,move I was swimming I don't say good and I just couldn't like go anywhere but,2019-06-13
00:08:40.520,00:08:47.759,don't just take my word for it watch Jordan try butterfly,2019-06-13
00:08:55.230,00:08:58.390,amazing unlike in the single layer where the,2019-06-13
00:08:58.390,00:09:02.230,balls could easily move past each other with multiple layers the balls kind of,2019-06-13
00:09:02.230,00:09:06.190,get trapped against each other and act more like a solid providing,2019-06-13
00:09:06.190,00:09:10.570,significantly more resistance so I wanted to see if I could use this to my,2019-06-13
00:09:10.570,00:09:15.640,advantage to lower myself gently down with the hose hit and see if,2019-06-13
00:09:15.640,00:09:31.320,I can float on top of all these v-shaped balls all right I'm floating in shape oh,2019-06-13
00:09:31.320,00:09:37.360,this feels incredible because like I can hardly tell there's water under me it,2019-06-13
00:09:37.360,00:09:44.790,feels like just being in a ball pit,2019-06-13
00:09:48.329,00:09:53.980,that is exactly like quicksand oh my goodness if you don't move,2019-06-13
00:09:53.980,00:09:58.029,you're good on the surface but then if you start moving around all the balls,2019-06-13
00:09:58.029,00:10:02.290,get enough energy to sort of shift and then you start sinking down deeper and,2019-06-13
00:10:02.290,00:10:07.810,deeper and deeper now after all this the one question I'm left with is what do,2019-06-13
00:10:07.810,00:10:14.319,"you do with 10,000 shade balls well I've decided that I am going to sign each one",2019-06-13
00:10:14.319,00:10:19.480,and mail it out to a patreon supporter so if you want to receive one of these,2019-06-13
00:10:19.480,00:10:25.569,balls signed by me go and sign up to be a patreon supporter now I my plan is to,2019-06-13
00:10:25.569,00:10:30.100,send these out to basically every patreon supporter I have everywhere in,2019-06-13
00:10:30.100,00:10:32.680,the world I'll put more details in the description below,2019-06-13
00:10:32.680,00:10:36.490,obviously the shipping costs are going to be horrendous but it is your support,2019-06-13
00:10:36.490,00:10:40.420,on patreon that allows me to do things like this so this is my way of saying,2019-06-13
00:10:40.420,00:10:42.899,thank you,2019-06-13
