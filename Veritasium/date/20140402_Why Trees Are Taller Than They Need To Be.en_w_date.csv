00:00:01.829,00:00:04.970,Have you ever noticed how badly people behave when they are collecting their luggage at,2014-04-02
00:00:04.970,00:00:06.000,the airport?,2014-04-02
00:00:06.000,00:00:10.020,I mean they all cluster right up against the carousel so people behind them can’t see,2014-04-02
00:00:10.020,00:00:11.020,their bags.,2014-04-02
00:00:11.020,00:00:14.509,"And then when you do spot your bag, you have to push through all the other passengers to",2014-04-02
00:00:14.509,00:00:18.580,collect it and usually bump into them as you are grabbing your bag off the carousel.,2014-04-02
00:00:18.580,00:00:20.539,Why is it that people behave so badly?,2014-04-02
00:00:20.539,00:00:24.470,It doesn’t seem to matter which airport you go to anywhere in the world.,2014-04-02
00:00:24.470,00:00:26.080,The problem is the same.,2014-04-02
00:00:26.080,00:00:30.330,"And this problem, believe it or not, is related to why trees are tall.",2014-04-02
00:00:30.330,00:00:31.820,Go with me on this.,2014-04-02
00:00:31.820,00:00:33.800,So why are trees this tall?,2014-04-02
00:00:33.800,00:00:35.440,I mean some of them are over 115 meters.,2014-04-02
00:00:35.440,00:00:38.600,They are the largest organisms on the planet.,2014-04-02
00:00:38.600,00:00:42.160,And you might think that they are this tall so that they can capture sunlight.,2014-04-02
00:00:42.160,00:00:44.110,And to a degree that is true.,2014-04-02
00:00:44.110,00:00:47.900,But anyone who has ever walked through a mature forest knows that the lower part of a tree,2014-04-02
00:00:47.900,00:00:50.330,has basically no branches and leaves.,2014-04-02
00:00:50.330,00:00:53.870,"And that makes sense, because not enough light filters down through the top most branches",2014-04-02
00:00:53.870,00:00:57.530,to make it worth having sun capturing apparatus down here.,2014-04-02
00:00:57.530,00:01:01.580,"Over millennia trees have evolved to put their energy where it yields returns, that is, in",2014-04-02
00:01:01.580,00:01:04.339,the canopy and not where it doesn’t.,2014-04-02
00:01:04.339,00:01:08.670,But this then begs the question: Why put all this energy into building a trunk that is,2014-04-02
00:01:08.670,00:01:13.240,10 or 20 meters if you are never intending to use this vertical space to capture sunlight?,2014-04-02
00:01:13.240,00:01:15.850,"I mean, it costs energy to make this trunk.",2014-04-02
00:01:15.850,00:01:19.930,Plus it makes it harder to transport water from the roots up to the topmost branches,2014-04-02
00:01:19.930,00:01:22.870,and it makes the tree more susceptible to water stress.,2014-04-02
00:01:22.870,00:01:28.210,"So it is in every individual tree’s best interest to be shorter, to not have this gigantic",2014-04-02
00:01:28.210,00:01:34.140,"trunk and to use the conserved energy to improve its seeds and its branches, to put its energy",2014-04-02
00:01:34.140,00:01:36.140,where it pays a return.,2014-04-02
00:01:36.140,00:01:39.970,"But, of course, if there was a mutation that allowed a tree to do this, you know what would",2014-04-02
00:01:39.970,00:01:41.060,happen to it.,2014-04-02
00:01:41.060,00:01:45.120,"In a forest surrounded by all these taller trees, it would be shaded from the sun and",2014-04-02
00:01:45.120,00:01:47.570,so it would wither and die.,2014-04-02
00:01:47.570,00:01:51.510,But what if all of the trees developed the same mutation?,2014-04-02
00:01:51.510,00:01:57.090,"What if they all created a friendship pact, a forest of friendship in which everyone agreed",2014-04-02
00:01:57.090,00:02:01.130,"not to grow such a big trunk, to star the leaves right at the ground?",2014-04-02
00:02:01.130,00:02:05.570,"Well, that would mean every individual tree would be better off.",2014-04-02
00:02:05.570,00:02:10.340,"The trouble is this solution is not stable, because any tiny mutation that results in",2014-04-02
00:02:10.340,00:02:13.450,a tree that is slightly taller would advantage that tree.,2014-04-02
00:02:13.450,00:02:16.490,It would be able to capture more light and it would shade its neighbors.,2014-04-02
00:02:16.490,00:02:19.150,And so pretty soon it would have more offspring.,2014-04-02
00:02:19.150,00:02:21.480,It would come to dominate the forest.,2014-04-02
00:02:21.480,00:02:26.470,And then any additional mutation down then line would result in even taller trees.,2014-04-02
00:02:26.470,00:02:28.950,This is how trees got so tall.,2014-04-02
00:02:28.950,00:02:35.090,"I mean, they would keep getting taller until the cost of going one more foot is exactly",2014-04-02
00:02:35.090,00:02:38.980,equal to benefits of collecting that additional sunlight.,2014-04-02
00:02:38.980,00:02:40.930,And that is why trees are as tall as they are today.,2014-04-02
00:02:40.930,00:02:42.750,"I mean, it is not an optimal solution.",2014-04-02
00:02:42.750,00:02:46.680,It is not like these trees have the best use of their energy.,2014-04-02
00:02:46.680,00:02:48.590,But it is the one that is stable.,2014-04-02
00:02:48.590,00:02:53.660,So the point is: Although it is in every tree’s best interest to be a part of this forest,2014-04-02
00:02:53.660,00:02:56.930,"of friendship, it will never work.",2014-04-02
00:02:56.930,00:03:01.540,"It will never last, because any individual who gets a little bit taller is going to ruin",2014-04-02
00:03:01.540,00:03:03.160,it for everyone.,2014-04-02
00:03:03.160,00:03:05.569,And it is the very same thing when you go to collect your bags.,2014-04-02
00:03:05.569,00:03:09.850,"I mean, if everyone could agree to stand a couple of meters away from the carousel, everyone",2014-04-02
00:03:09.850,00:03:13.130,would have a good view of their bags and be able to easily step forward and collect their,2014-04-02
00:03:13.130,00:03:14.130,luggage.,2014-04-02
00:03:14.130,00:03:17.770,"But, of course, one person standing forward is going to block the view of behind them.",2014-04-02
00:03:17.770,00:03:19.340,So everyone is going to rush forward.,2014-04-02
00:03:19.340,00:03:22.569,"It is an unstable solution, just like a forest of friendship.",2014-04-02
00:03:22.569,00:03:23.739,So remember.,2014-04-02
00:03:23.739,00:03:27.780,"Next time you are frustrated collecting your bags at the airport, remember.",2014-04-02
00:03:27.780,00:03:33.960,Trees know just how you feel.,2014-04-02
00:03:33.960,00:03:45.200,&gt;&gt; I have summarized the whole problem for you here.,2014-04-02
00:03:45.200,00:03:45.510,Are you ready?,2014-04-02
