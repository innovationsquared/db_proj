00:00:25.450,00:00:27.110,So I came up to Stanford,2021-02-18
00:00:27.110,00:00:30.310,to meet Zach Hammond and his soft robot.,2021-02-18
00:00:30.310,00:00:31.740,How's it going?,2021-02-18
00:00:31.740,00:00:33.240,"All right, you want to tip it?",2021-02-18
00:00:36.700,00:00:40.680,So is the idea that the robot could walk this way?,2021-02-18

00:02:59.330,00:03:00.330,- Perfect.,2021-02-18
00:03:00.330,00:03:03.640,- Just that easy. Did you build this by yourself?,2021-02-18
00:03:03.640,00:03:07.930,"- Me and one other grad student built this entire thing ourselves, basically.",2021-02-18

00:03:17.310,00:03:22.620,- The main structural members of this robot are fabric tubes inflated with air.,2021-02-18
00:03:22.620,00:03:29.379,"- Yeah, so these red tubes are a nylon fabric and then internally, there is a polyethylene",2021-02-18

00:03:32.329,00:03:37.960,- The tubes are inflated to about six PSI above atmospheric. So it's almost one and,2021-02-18
00:03:37.960,00:03:44.069,a half atmospheres. Each tube passes through pairs of rollers connected to a motor. The,2021-02-18

00:03:47.889,00:03:51.750,- Add the rods and then we have this like high friction material wrapped around the,2021-02-18
00:03:51.750,00:03:55.580,rods. And then that coupled with the fact that we have this pressurized tube that's,2021-02-18
00:03:55.580,00:03:59.909,"kind of pushing the membrane of the tube into the rollers, prevents us from slipping.",2021-02-18

00:04:03.879,00:04:09.519,- Kind of like when a clown creates a twist in a balloon and then folds that balloon into,2021-02-18
00:04:09.519,00:04:14.069,a balloon animal. The difference between what the clown does and what we do is that there's,2021-02-18
00:04:14.069,00:04:19.410,"some passage of air between adjacent segments of the tube. So that as the robot drives around,",2021-02-18

00:04:32.841,00:04:38.110,"why we've named these robots after different sausages. So this one's called Polish, that",2021-02-18
00:04:38.110,00:04:43.100,"one over there is Chorizo, There's a Linguica and a kielbasa over there somewhere.",2021-02-18
00:04:43.100,00:04:45.460,- So what shape is the overall thing? It's an octahedron?,2021-02-18
00:04:45.460,00:04:51.190,"- Yeah, we call it an octahedron because if you drew lines between these kind of kinematic",2021-02-18
00:04:51.190,00:04:54.990,"joints here, it would create an octahedral shape.",2021-02-18
00:04:54.990,00:04:59.020,"- Driving the motors together, allows the robot to dramatically change shape. It can",2021-02-18
00:04:59.020,00:05:06.580,"get very tall or short and squat. But since the tubes themselves don't change in length,",2021-02-18
00:05:06.580,00:05:11.810,"the overall perimeter of the robot, the length of all the edges combined doesn't change.",2021-02-18
00:05:11.810,00:05:19.050,So the robot is considered isoparametric. How do you feel when you watch those Boston,2021-02-18
00:05:19.050,00:05:20.059,Dynamics videos?,2021-02-18
00:05:20.059,00:05:22.139,"- Oh, I love those videos, they're so cool.",2021-02-18
00:05:22.139,00:05:23.930,- The Boston Dynamics robots are kind of terrifying.,2021-02-18
00:05:23.930,00:05:24.930,- Mm-hmm.,2021-02-18
00:05:24.930,00:05:28.130,"- I guess and the idea with soft robots, it's to like convince people that robots are good",2021-02-18
00:05:28.130,00:05:30.620,"and soft and kind, and friendly and fake?",2021-02-18
00:05:30.620,00:05:34.650,"- That's definitely true, yeah. There are some things that you can do to rigid systems",2021-02-18
00:05:34.650,00:05:39.050,to make them feel like compliant systems based on how you're controlling the motors. But,2021-02-18
00:05:39.050,00:05:44.160,"yeah, they're definitely, you know, heavy expensive and can be dangerous if they're",2021-02-18
00:05:44.160,00:05:45.890,not used correctly.,2021-02-18
00:05:45.890,00:05:51.720,- The hard robots we're used to are strong and precise. Their actions are accurate and,2021-02-18
00:05:51.720,00:05:57.670,"repeatable, but they are also heavy and they can't really change their volume as dramatically,",2021-02-18
00:05:57.670,00:06:02.380,but this robot is still capable of carrying a heavy load.,2021-02-18
00:06:02.380,00:06:04.080,- So I have a GUI in MATLAB.,2021-02-18
00:06:04.080,00:06:05.080,- Oh nice.,2021-02-18
00:06:05.080,00:06:09.699,- That enables me to just put in the positions that I want the robots to move in inches and,2021-02-18
00:06:09.699,00:06:14.009,then send them out. There's another other functionality of some like stored configurations,2021-02-18
00:06:14.009,00:06:15.460,to send to the robots.,2021-02-18
00:06:15.460,00:06:20.710,- Soft robots also have the advantage of shape changing. They can become tall to go over,2021-02-18
00:06:20.710,00:06:24.350,obstacles or short to fit under obstructions.,2021-02-18
00:06:24.350,00:06:28.970,- So if there is some rock that it didn't see or that it wanted to roll over. It could,2021-02-18
00:06:28.970,00:06:34.850,simply do that and the compliance of the tubes would simply just bend around that disturbance.,2021-02-18
00:06:34.850,00:06:38.460,- Do you imagine robots like this doing work in space?,2021-02-18
00:06:38.460,00:06:39.750,"- Oh yeah, definitely.",2021-02-18
00:06:39.750,00:06:44.020,- So one of the nice things about these types of structures is that they can shrink down,2021-02-18
00:06:44.020,00:06:50.740,"their volume very drastically. And because volume on rockets is such an expensive premium,",2021-02-18
00:06:50.740,00:06:55.400,being able to have a robot that can pack down small for transport is very valuable. So NASA,2021-02-18
00:06:55.400,00:07:00.539,was at one point looking into trust robots for exactly that reason. And they've contacted,2021-02-18
00:07:00.539,00:07:06.190,us since we've made this robot to explore different ideas for space exploration projects.,2021-02-18
00:07:06.190,00:07:09.620,So one of the things that they're thinking about doing is deploying robots underneath,2021-02-18
00:07:09.620,00:07:14.770,a sheet of ice. So they're gonna drill through this sheet of ice and then deposit a robot,2021-02-18
00:07:14.770,00:07:19.350,through what is a kind of a small diameter hole. And so if you can have a robot that,2021-02-18
00:07:19.350,00:07:24.910,can change its volume very drastically or be disassembled and then reassembled to form,2021-02-18
00:07:24.910,00:07:29.910,like a much larger structure. Then you can have large robots that are able to fit through,2021-02-18
00:07:29.910,00:07:33.670,these tight spaces and be deployed in kind of difficult to access areas.,2021-02-18
00:07:33.670,00:07:38.000,- Is this a little bit like an octopus? Is that how you could think of it?,2021-02-18
00:07:38.000,00:07:41.630,- There is some connection there because they use their shape changing ability and their,2021-02-18
00:07:41.630,00:07:47.669,"compliance to squeeze through tight passageways, and then also to wrap their body around objects.",2021-02-18
00:07:47.669,00:07:51.300,"So for example, they can open jars with their tentacles, and one of the things that we want",2021-02-18
00:07:51.300,00:07:54.720,to use this robot for is grasping and manipulating objects.,2021-02-18
00:07:54.720,00:07:59.620,- So this robot is even capable of picking objects up off the ground.,2021-02-18
00:07:59.620,00:08:10.389,"- We'll try that and see if we can grab it. Because of the compliance of the tubes, it",2021-02-18
00:08:10.389,00:08:15.370,"has a natural ability to grasp and manipulate objects because as it does so, the tubes bend",2021-02-18
00:08:15.370,00:08:20.889,"ever so slightly, which increases the contact area and distributes evenly, the forces that",2021-02-18
00:08:20.889,00:08:22.479,are exerted on the object.,2021-02-18
00:08:22.479,00:08:25.490,"- So, I mean is the biggest risk if it pops?",2021-02-18
00:08:25.490,00:08:32.479,"- Yeah, that's a a big risk. I mean you obviously need the compressed air for your structure",2021-02-18
00:08:32.479,00:08:41.849,"and so if you have a leak. Oh. Then you don't have a robot, right?",2021-02-18
00:08:41.849,00:08:45.819,- It's a pretty big drawback of soft robots.,2021-02-18
00:08:45.819,00:08:48.839,"- You know, some things that you could do to mitigate that would be to have onboard",2021-02-18
00:08:48.839,00:08:54.920,"a small compressor, which isn't there to provide power to the robot, but would help you maintain",2021-02-18
00:08:54.920,00:08:57.359,"pressure, if there were any small leaks.",2021-02-18
00:08:57.359,00:09:01.289,"- when you tell someone you're working on a robot and they see this, does it defy expectations?",2021-02-18
00:09:01.289,00:09:06.389,- Totally. They have no idea what it is I'm talking about until I show them like a video,2021-02-18
00:09:06.389,00:09:12.339,or a picture. I think most people's conception of soft robots was really expanded by the,2021-02-18
00:09:12.339,00:09:17.809,movie Big Hero 6. And I think they did a great job in kind of showcasing what a soft robot,2021-02-18
00:09:17.809,00:09:21.850,"can do and why they're useful, and kind of just popularizing the notion. It's really",2021-02-18
00:09:21.850,00:09:27.399,"great to have compliance built into any mechanical system, especially as we want robots to work",2021-02-18
00:09:27.399,00:09:31.610,closer and closer with humans. So I think we'll definitely see more soft robots in the,2021-02-18
00:09:31.610,00:09:33.810,future.,2021-02-18
