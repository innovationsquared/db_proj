00:00:08.580,00:00:12.740,I've been driving along Australia's famous Great Ocean Road.,2012-01-07
00:00:14.900,00:00:19.120,"And I'm stopped here near the Twelve Apostles, which are these big sandstone bluffs.",2012-01-07
00:00:19.120,00:00:22.520,"Actually, there's only eight of them left because the others have eroded over time.",2012-01-07
00:00:22.840,00:00:26.860,And erosion is really what's given us this coastline the way it looks now.,2012-01-07
00:00:27.220,00:00:29.260,So that brings to mind a question for me.,2012-01-07
00:00:29.400,00:00:32.080,"Which is ""How long is the Australian coast line?""",2012-01-07
00:00:32.600,00:00:35.900,"Well, if you were to measure it out in lengths of 500 kilometers,",2012-01-07
00:00:36.140,00:00:39.520,You would find that it's about 12 and a half thousand kilometers long.,2012-01-07
00:00:40.400,00:00:47.000,"But the CIA World Factbook puts the figure at more than double that. Over 25,700 kilometers.",2012-01-07
00:00:47.280,00:00:51.680,But how can it be that we have two different estimates for the length of the same coastline?,2012-01-07
00:00:52.260,00:00:54.920,"Well this is called ""The Coastline Paradox.""",2012-01-07
00:00:54.920,00:00:58.800,"The answer is, it depends on the length of measuring stick that you use.",2012-01-07
00:00:59.600,00:01:03.260,"So, if you connect up the dots from cliff to cliff to cliff",2012-01-07
00:01:03.260,00:01:08.560,You get a shorter length of coastline than if you measure with a smaller measuring stick,2012-01-07
00:01:08.560,00:01:10.480,And measure into every inlet.,2012-01-07
00:01:10.860,00:01:13.100,So what length of measuring stick should we use?,2012-01-07
00:01:13.100,00:01:16.360,"Well in theory, you can go all the way down to the size of a water molecule",2012-01-07
00:01:16.360,00:01:19.800,"And if you do that, then the length of Australia's coast is virtually infinite.",2012-01-07
00:01:20.240,00:01:27.580,Do you believe me that you could have finite area object like Australia bounded by an infinite perimeter?,2012-01-07
00:01:27.980,00:01:29.600,It doesn't seem to make sense.,2012-01-07
00:01:29.600,00:01:33.520,"But I can give you another example of this, it's called the Koch snowflake",2012-01-07
00:01:33.520,00:01:37.620,so what you do is you take a triangle with sides of length 1,2012-01-07
00:01:37.620,00:01:39.120,and then on each side,2012-01-07
00:01:39.130,00:01:41.830,add another triangle with sides of length a third,2012-01-07
00:01:41.830,00:01:44.400,Continute doing that again and again forever,2012-01-07
00:01:44.409,00:01:48.759,What you end up with is a shape which is a finite area but an infinite perimeter,2012-01-07
00:01:50.520,00:01:55.060,shapes like these are called fractals and many coastlines have the same,2012-01-07
00:01:55.060,00:01:59.889,fractal structure which means they have some sort of self-similarity on many,2012-01-07
00:01:59.889,00:02:02.449,different scales so you can zoom in and zoom in,2012-01-07
00:02:02.449,00:02:04.659,and the coastline looks roughly the same,2012-01-07
00:02:04.659,00:02:08.769,so if you want to know the length of a coastline you need to first specify the,2012-01-07
00:02:08.769,00:02:10.209,length of your measuring stick,2012-01-07
00:02:10.209,00:02:13.150,because that's what the answer depends on.,2012-01-07
