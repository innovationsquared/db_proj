00:04:33.990,00:04:34.908,right now it would roll over.,2022-08-31
00:04:35.010,00:04:35.775,- Right.,2022-08-31
00:04:35.880,00:04:36.743,- Then you put it down.,2022-08-31

00:05:27.990,00:05:31.531,Nearly 10 times higher than the previous record holder.,2022-08-31
00:05:31.650,00:05:35.001,"Well, this jumper has three special design features.",2022-08-31
00:05:35.130,00:05:38.939,"First, the jumper is incredibly light at just 30 grams.",2022-08-31
00:05:39.060,00:05:41.508,It achieves this weight by employing a tiny motor,2022-08-31
00:05:41.610,00:05:42.509,and battery.,2022-08-31
00:05:42.600,00:05:46.012,Plus its entire structure made of lightweight carbon fiber,2022-08-31
00:05:46.110,00:05:48.682,and rubber doubles as the spring.,2022-08-31
00:05:48.780,00:05:52.285,Per unit mass natural latex rubber can store more energy,2022-08-31
00:05:52.380,00:05:54.788,"than nearly any other elastic material,",2022-08-31
00:05:54.870,00:05:57.243,"7,000 joules per kilogram.",2022-08-31
00:06:02.520,00:06:05.899,And the design of the spring makes it ideal for its purpose.,2022-08-31
00:06:06.060,00:06:08.568,Initially they tried using only rubber bands connected,2022-08-31
00:06:08.700,00:06:10.804,"to hinged aluminum rods,",2022-08-31
00:06:10.950,00:06:14.174,"but with this design when compressing it, the force rises",2022-08-31
00:06:14.310,00:06:16.509,to a peak and then decreases.,2022-08-31
00:06:16.650,00:06:19.713,Just feels like it all of a sudden got a lot easier to pull.,2022-08-31
00:06:20.550,00:06:24.017,Another design with only carbon fiber slats requires a lot,2022-08-31
00:06:24.150,00:06:25.385,"of force to get started,",2022-08-31
00:06:25.500,00:06:27.687,and then it increases linearly after that.,2022-08-31
00:06:27.810,00:06:30.624,There is more and more force required to do this.,2022-08-31
00:06:30.750,00:06:33.593,The ultimate design is a hybrid of these two approaches.,2022-08-31
00:06:33.720,00:06:36.563,The benefit being it's force profile is almost flat,2022-08-31
00:06:36.690,00:06:38.999,over the entire range of compression.,2022-08-31
00:06:39.120,00:06:40.767,"Feels like that needs a lot of force,",2022-08-31
00:06:40.890,00:06:43.436,and now it feels pretty steady,2022-08-31
00:06:43.560,00:06:45.672,with the amount of force that I need to apply.,2022-08-31
00:06:45.780,00:06:48.208,Therefore it provides double the energy storage,2022-08-31
00:06:48.330,00:06:49.409,of a typical spring,2022-08-31
00:06:49.500,00:06:52.012,where force is proportional to displacement.,2022-08-31
00:06:52.110,00:06:54.180,The researchers argue this is the most,2022-08-31
00:06:54.270,00:06:56.283,efficient spring ever made.,2022-08-31

00:06:59.460,00:07:01.688,it's not always consistent that it releases,2022-08-31

00:07:04.080,00:07:04.913,- Ooh.,2022-08-31

00:07:08.151,00:07:09.229,(fingers snap),2022-08-31
00:07:09.390,00:07:10.897,I'll be right back. - All right.,2022-08-31
00:07:11.040,00:07:12.866,- You'd probably expect that lighter would always,2022-08-31
00:07:13.020,00:07:14.134,"be better with a jumper,",2022-08-31
00:07:14.280,00:07:16.603,especially if the added weight is simply dead weight,2022-08-31
00:07:16.740,00:07:19.205,rather than anything useful like a spring or a motor.,2022-08-31
00:07:19.350,00:07:21.941,- So we're adding basically a chunk of steel,2022-08-31
00:07:22.080,00:07:24.577,to our jumper and it's gonna jump higher.,2022-08-31
00:07:24.720,00:07:27.280,And the key is that we're adding it to the top.,2022-08-31
00:07:27.420,00:07:28.748,"You want your body,",2022-08-31
00:07:28.890,00:07:32.118,the part that's moving to weigh at least as much as the foot,2022-08-31
00:07:32.250,00:07:34.387,and when your body's lighter it's basically this collision,2022-08-31
00:07:34.530,00:07:36.189,this energy transfer is very inefficient,2022-08-31
00:07:36.330,00:07:37.780,and you don't jump very high.,2022-08-31
00:07:39.090,00:07:40.026,- But the real secret to how,2022-08-31
00:07:40.140,00:07:42.495,this jumper can achieve such heights is through something,2022-08-31
00:07:42.630,00:07:46.166,"the researchers call work multiplication, unlike an animal",2022-08-31
00:07:46.290,00:07:49.102,"which can only jump using a single stroke of its muscle,",2022-08-31
00:07:49.200,00:07:50.937,an engineered jumper can store up,2022-08-31
00:07:51.060,00:07:53.606,the energy from many strokes or in this case,2022-08-31
00:07:53.700,00:07:55.842,many revolutions of its motor.,2022-08-31
00:07:55.950,00:07:58.311,And that's how the motor can be so small.,2022-08-31
00:07:58.410,00:08:01.014,It doesn't have to deliver the energy all at once.,2022-08-31
00:08:01.170,00:08:03.817,It builds it up gradually over a few minutes.,2022-08-31
00:08:03.990,00:08:07.954,So the trade off is kind of like time for energy.,2022-08-31
00:08:08.100,00:08:08.822,- Exactly.,2022-08-31
00:08:08.970,00:08:10.056,- And this is possible because,2022-08-31
00:08:10.200,00:08:12.792,there is a latch under tension preventing the spring,2022-08-31
00:08:12.960,00:08:16.496,from unspooling until the robot is fully compressed.,2022-08-31
00:08:16.650,00:08:20.867,"Interestingly, biological organisms do use latches,",2022-08-31
00:08:21.030,00:08:22.569,"for example the sand flee,",2022-08-31
00:08:22.710,00:08:26.106,which can jump incredibly high for its body size.,2022-08-31
00:08:26.250,00:08:28.875,"- It has a muscle that is attached,",2022-08-31

00:08:30.720,00:08:33.446,is right inside of the pivot point.,2022-08-31
00:08:33.570,00:08:34.381,So as it contracts,2022-08-31
00:08:34.530,00:08:36.483,"that muscle the leg doesn't extend, right?",2022-08-31
00:08:36.630,00:08:39.052,"It's actually closing it more,",2022-08-31
00:08:39.180,00:08:42.722,but then it has a second muscle that pulls it out.,2022-08-31
00:08:42.840,00:08:47.060,It's going to shift this muscle ever so slightly,2022-08-31
00:08:47.190,00:08:48.795,outside the pivot point.,2022-08-31
00:08:48.930,00:08:51.731,That's wild. So there's these two muscles that are working.,2022-08-31
00:08:51.840,00:08:53.466,"- Yeah. So here's your big power muscle,",2022-08-31
00:08:53.580,00:08:54.834,here's your trigger muscle.,2022-08-31
00:08:54.960,00:08:56.569,It's a torque reversal mechanism,2022-08-31
00:08:56.670,00:08:58.972,and then all of a sudden it shoots.,2022-08-31
00:08:59.070,00:09:01.741,- But even though the biological world has latches,2022-08-31
00:09:01.920,00:09:05.145,no organism has developed work multiplication for a jump,2022-08-31
00:09:05.310,00:09:06.446,from standstill.,2022-08-31
00:09:06.630,00:09:10.683,"At least not internally, spider monkeys have been observed",2022-08-31
00:09:10.860,00:09:14.320,pulling back a branch hand over hand using multiple muscle,2022-08-31
00:09:14.490,00:09:17.457,strokes stored in the bend of the branch to,2022-08-31
00:09:17.610,00:09:19.959,catapult themselves forward.,2022-08-31
00:09:20.100,00:09:22.562,There's a spider that shoots out a silky string,2022-08-31
00:09:22.710,00:09:24.564,which they pull back multiple times in order,2022-08-31
00:09:24.720,00:09:28.034,to slingshot themselves to another location.,2022-08-31
00:09:28.170,00:09:29.569,So it's like slingshotting itself?,2022-08-31
00:09:29.700,00:09:31.583,- Yes. So they are called the slingshot spider.,2022-08-31
00:09:33.990,00:09:36.476,- Now I tried jumping in moon boots to see if,2022-08-31
00:09:36.630,00:09:39.047,they would help me go higher.,2022-08-31
00:09:40.889,00:09:42.248,- That is okay. (laughs),2022-08-31
00:09:42.389,00:09:43.516,- Okay,2022-08-31
00:09:43.664,00:09:44.497,Ooh.,2022-08-31
00:09:46.080,00:09:48.488,"- And it certainly felt like they did,",2022-08-31
00:09:48.630,00:09:51.391,but Elliot pointed out that from a standing start,2022-08-31
00:09:51.510,00:09:52.859,they don't actually help much.,2022-08-31
00:09:52.980,00:09:55.295,"- Like kinda build it, build it, build it, and then go.",2022-08-31
00:09:55.421,00:09:56.129,- Okay.,2022-08-31
00:09:56.254,00:09:59.365,"Only if you jump a few times before, can you store up some",2022-08-31
00:09:59.490,00:10:03.069,of the previous jumps energy in the elastic bands and then,2022-08-31
00:10:03.180,00:10:06.453,that energy helps launch you higher on the following jump.,2022-08-31
00:10:09.240,00:10:11.578,"For years, engineered jumping was developed to",2022-08-31
00:10:11.670,00:10:14.814,"mimic biological jumping, but with work multiplication",2022-08-31
00:10:14.910,00:10:16.683,it gained an advantage.,2022-08-31
00:10:16.770,00:10:18.818,If you can generate a large burst of energy,2022-08-31
00:10:18.930,00:10:21.354,simply by running a motor for a long time,2022-08-31
00:10:21.450,00:10:24.390,the power of the motor is no longer the limiting factor,2022-08-31
00:10:24.480,00:10:25.592,The spring is.,2022-08-31
00:10:25.680,00:10:27.193,So you can focus on making,2022-08-31
00:10:27.270,00:10:29.696,the most powerful spring possible.,2022-08-31
00:10:29.790,00:10:32.832,This jumper has nearly maximized the achievable height,2022-08-31
00:10:32.910,00:10:34.033,with this spring.,2022-08-31
00:10:34.110,00:10:35.768,Assuming an infinitely light motor,2022-08-31
00:10:35.850,00:10:39.205,with infinite time to wind up the highest possible jump,2022-08-31
00:10:39.270,00:10:40.940,with this compression spring is only,2022-08-31
00:10:41.010,00:10:44.377,around 19% higher than what they've achieved.,2022-08-31
00:10:44.460,00:10:46.546,If you want to incorporate air resistance,2022-08-31
00:10:46.620,00:10:47.947,and play with aerodynamics,2022-08-31
00:10:48.030,00:10:50.016,another way to send the jumper higher is to,2022-08-31
00:10:50.070,00:10:53.052,make it 10 times isometrically larger leading,2022-08-31
00:10:53.100,00:10:55.588,to a 15 to 20% higher jump.,2022-08-31
00:10:55.650,00:10:57.757,- So we're in kind of an intermediate scale where,2022-08-31
00:10:57.810,00:10:59.259,we still are getting hit by air drag,2022-08-31
00:10:59.310,00:11:01.127,but it's not as bad as the flee.,2022-08-31
00:11:01.260,00:11:02.529,If we went 10 times bigger,2022-08-31
00:11:02.640,00:11:05.131,we could actually avoid drag completely.,2022-08-31
00:11:05.260,00:11:08.201,- This works since if the jumper is scaled up ten times,2022-08-31
00:11:08.310,00:11:11.104,on all sides the cross sectional area increases,2022-08-31
00:11:11.220,00:11:12.071,"by a hundred,",2022-08-31
00:11:12.180,00:11:14.173,which increases the drag force,2022-08-31
00:11:14.280,00:11:17.610,but the jumper's mass increases by a thousand.,2022-08-31
00:11:17.730,00:11:20.213,So it has way more inertia meaning,2022-08-31
00:11:20.310,00:11:22.473,the drag force affects it less.,2022-08-31
00:11:25.110,00:11:27.353,The entire concept of work multiplication,2022-08-31
00:11:27.450,00:11:29.923,could bring robots to the next level.,2022-08-31
00:11:30.000,00:11:32.926,Currently motors and robots have to be relatively small,2022-08-31
00:11:33.030,00:11:34.661,so they remain portable.,2022-08-31
00:11:34.740,00:11:36.162,But the simple principle of building,2022-08-31
00:11:36.240,00:11:38.164,up the energy from multiple turns of a motor,2022-08-31
00:11:38.250,00:11:41.000,over time would allow robots to store,2022-08-31
00:11:41.070,00:11:43.903,and then release huge amounts of energy,2022-08-31
00:11:43.980,00:11:46.593,and set some world records in the process.,2022-08-31
00:11:48.075,00:11:50.658,(outro music),2022-08-31
00:11:54.090,00:11:56.349,Getting this robot off the ground required more,2022-08-31
00:11:56.400,00:11:57.584,than just engineering.,2022-08-31
00:11:57.660,00:12:00.119,It took a deep understanding of math and physics.,2022-08-31
