00:00:01.780,00:00:04.420,How much energy is there in empty space ?,2016-09-08
00:00:04.780,00:00:09.120,We believe there is 10 to the minus 8th ergs in every cubic centimeter of empty space,2016-09-08
00:00:09.220,00:00:10.260,"How much is an ""erg"" ?",2016-09-08
00:00:10.560,00:00:15.020,"It's a very small amount, you know if a... If a mosquito flaps its wings, or a fly I guess",2016-09-08
00:00:15.020,00:00:17.740,"flaps its wings, it's about 1 ergs worth of energy.",2016-09-08
00:00:17.780,00:00:19.200,So an erg is not very much,2016-09-08
00:00:19.340,00:00:24.160,"Uhh, we're talking about a hundred millionth of an erg in every cubic centimeter of space",2016-09-08
00:00:24.420,00:00:29.120,"Now, it might seem strange that completely empty space contains energy, but",2016-09-08
00:00:29.120,00:00:32.300,there are 2 good reasons why scientists think this is the case.,2016-09-08
00:00:32.400,00:00:35.840,One is because the expansion of the universe is speeding up,2016-09-08
00:00:35.840,00:00:38.040,"and that's thought to be caused by dark energy,",2016-09-08
00:00:38.140,00:00:41.140,which fills all space and makes gravity repulsive.,2016-09-08
00:00:41.140,00:00:44.660,"We always think that gravity always pulls, but according to Einstein",2016-09-08
00:00:44.660,00:00:48.060,the way gravity works really depends on the material itself and,2016-09-08
00:00:48.420,00:00:52.580,"energy tied to space, gravity pushes, it doesn't pull.",2016-09-08
00:00:52.680,00:00:56.420,"If that number is 10 to the minus 8th ergs, per cubic centimeter",2016-09-08
00:00:56.420,00:00:59.700,"Then you fit the data, then that's the dark energy that makes universe accelerate",2016-09-08
00:00:59.700,00:01:01.700,"It's constant, does everything you want.",2016-09-08
00:01:01.700,00:01:04.540,The second reason why empty space contains energy,2016-09-08
00:01:04.680,00:01:06.640,"is because it isn't really ""empty"".",2016-09-08
00:01:06.760,00:01:09.020,"There is the idea that, thanks to quantum mechanics,",2016-09-08
00:01:09.020,00:01:12.620,"we do expect particles to come in and out of existence, and so",2016-09-08
00:01:12.820,00:01:14.300,space is full of energy,2016-09-08
00:01:14.380,00:01:17.820,"Yeah, there was nothing there when we first looked and nothing there when we later looked",2016-09-08
00:01:18.040,00:01:21.120,"Could we say for sure, if we had looked in the middle",2016-09-08
00:01:21.120,00:01:22.480,that there weren't particles there ?,2016-09-08
00:01:22.480,00:01:23.980,"No, there might have been",2016-09-08
00:01:24.660,00:01:30.800,"Evidence for these so-called ""virtual particles"" came from studying the light emitted by energized hydrogen atoms.",2016-09-08
00:01:31.180,00:01:36.740,Niels Bohr first used the particular colors of light to divise his quantum model of the atom.,2016-09-08
00:01:36.980,00:01:42.060,"where the electron orbits the nucleus in certain allowed orbits, each with its own specific energy.",2016-09-08
00:01:42.060,00:01:46.220,"When the electron jumps from a higher-energy orbit to a lower one, it gives off light",2016-09-08
00:01:46.280,00:01:51.160,and the energy enhanced color of that light is determined by the energy difference between the two levels.,2016-09-08
00:01:51.420,00:01:56.560,"As quantum theory developed, Bohr's orbits were superseded by probablistic electron clouds,",2016-09-08
00:01:56.780,00:01:59.760,but the energy levels remained mostly unchanged.,2016-09-08
00:02:00.040,00:02:04.460,"Then, in 1947, Willis Lamb and his grad student Robert Retherford",2016-09-08
00:02:04.460,00:02:09.780,"attempted to test the best version of quantum theory at the time, which was the Dirac equation.",2016-09-08
00:02:10.040,00:02:15.320,And they did this by measuring the energy levels in hydrogen more precisely than ever before.,2016-09-08
00:02:15.780,00:02:19.580,"Now, what they found did not match up with the theory.",2016-09-08
00:02:19.760,00:02:26.160,"One of the energy levels was actually not one, but rather two, very closely spaced energy levels.",2016-09-08
00:02:26.500,00:02:28.560,And this is known as the Lamb shift.,2016-09-08
00:02:29.020,00:02:32.620,They used microwaves to excite the electron between these two levels.,2016-09-08
00:02:32.860,00:02:36.720,"So, why were there two energy levels where there was supposed to be just one ?",2016-09-08
00:02:37.260,00:02:39.200,"Well, the answer is Virtual Particles.",2016-09-08
00:02:39.560,00:02:45.400,For example around the proton virtual electron-positron pairs pop in and out of existence.,2016-09-08
00:02:45.540,00:02:50.060,This is permitted by the laws of Quantum Mechanics so long as they don't stick around for too long.,2016-09-08
00:02:50.060,00:02:56.480,During their brief lives the negative electron is attracted to the positive proton while the positron is repelled away from it.,2016-09-08
00:02:56.480,00:03:01.080,This means the charge of the proton is shielded by the  virtual electrons surrounding it.,2016-09-08
00:03:01.080,00:03:06.120,This affects the energy of the 2s orbital - in which the electron is closer to the nucleus -,2016-09-08
00:03:06.120,00:03:11.120,"differently from the 2p orbital, and that's what causes the energy levels to split.",2016-09-08
00:03:11.120,00:03:14.260,And this is just one contribution to the energy difference.,2016-09-08
00:03:14.260,00:03:17.820,The full calculation involves drawing a series of Feynman diagrams,2016-09-08
00:03:17.900,00:03:21.980,that show all the possible interactions between real and virtual particles,2016-09-08
00:03:21.980,00:03:24.480,and adding up the contribution from each one.,2016-09-08
00:03:24.480,00:03:28.380,And there's an infinite chain of these different diagrams.,2016-09-08
00:03:28.380,00:03:30.720,So you might worry that you can predict nothing at all,2016-09-08
00:03:30.720,00:03:33.480,because you'd need to add up an infinite number of numbers to get the right answer.,2016-09-08
00:03:33.840,00:03:38.140,But the point is that every time you have these two... vertices,2016-09-08
00:03:38.140,00:03:41.360,these two places where the photon hits the electron,2016-09-08
00:03:41.360,00:03:47.440,"that's associated with a number alpha, the fine-structure constant, which is 1/137, which is a small number.",2016-09-08
00:03:48.100,00:03:53.560,"So,  this leading term, this classical contribution is already small",2016-09-08
00:03:53.560,00:03:58.400,"and these more-complicated ones, you notice there are more vertices up here",2016-09-08
00:03:58.400,00:04:02.300,and as the diagrams get more and more complicated there are more and more of these terms,2016-09-08
00:04:02.300,00:04:08.260,"so you get alpha squared; alpha cubed; alpha to the fourth, and the numbers become smaller and smaller and smaller",2016-09-08
00:04:08.720,00:04:10.960,so the more complicated diagrams,2016-09-08
00:04:11.200,00:04:16.320,the more intricate effects of the virtual particles become less and less important.,2016-09-08
00:04:16.320,00:04:22.160,"Using the Dirac equation, but adding in the effects of virtual electrons, positrons, and photons",2016-09-08
00:04:22.160,00:04:28.240,we can actually calculate the values of atomic parameters with better accuracy than 1 part in a billion.,2016-09-08
00:04:29.220,00:04:36.820,"That is incredible. In fact, physicists Lawrence Krauss calls it: ""The best and most accurate prediction in all of science.""",2016-09-08
00:04:36.940,00:04:40.780,So with the spectacular usefulness of virtual particles,2016-09-08
00:04:40.780,00:04:44.340,"You think it would be pretty hard for anyone to doubt their existence,",2016-09-08
00:04:44.340,00:04:48.000,"But then again, they have never been directly observed.",2016-09-08
00:04:48.000,00:04:50.520,"In fact, theoretically, that's impossible.",2016-09-08
00:04:50.980,00:05:01.740,"Explaining virtual particles is always tricky, because it's very hard to think of them in any sort of real way.",2016-09-08
00:05:01.740,00:05:05.240,"They can go in the opposite direction of their momenta, and... and...",2016-09-08
00:05:05.340,00:05:09.840,And do these things which are not consistent with... with a real particle.,2016-09-08
00:05:09.840,00:05:13.320,So virtual particles have a strange sort of existence.,2016-09-08
00:05:13.320,00:05:16.260,"Where they're indispensable for calculations, obviously,",2016-09-08
00:05:16.260,00:05:18.840,but you can never directly observe them.,2016-09-08
00:05:19.340,00:05:26.400,"But maybe this is not actually a real problem, it's just the result of thinking about reality in the wrong way.",2016-09-08
00:05:26.400,00:05:31.760,"Maybe as the fundamental building blocks of our universe, we shouldn't be talking about particles at all;",2016-09-08
