00:00:05.000,00:00:10.901,I want you to consider a problem that's been one of the most controversial in math&nbsp;and philosophy over the past 20 years.,2023-02-11
00:00:10.901,00:00:12.993,There is no consensus answer.,2023-02-11
00:00:12.993,00:00:19.647,So I want you to listen to the&nbsp;problem and then vote for the answer you prefer using the like and dislike buttons.,2023-02-11
00:00:19.647,00:00:22.398,"Okay, here is&nbsp;the setup:",2023-02-11
00:00:22.398,00:00:25.726,Sleeping Beauty volunteers to be the subject of an experiment.,2023-02-11
00:00:25.726,00:00:29.091,And before it starts&nbsp;she's informed of the procedure.,2023-02-11
00:00:29.091,00:00:31.653,On Sunday night she will be put to sleep.,2023-02-11
00:00:31.653,00:00:34.820,And then a fair coin will&nbsp; be flipped.,2023-02-11
00:00:34.820,00:00:39.827,"If that coin comes up heads, she'll be awakened on Monday and then put back to sleep.",2023-02-11
00:00:39.827,00:00:43.959,If&nbsp;the coin comes up Tails she will also be awakened on Monday and put back to sleep.,2023-02-11
00:00:43.959,00:00:48.549,But then she will&nbsp;be awakened on Tuesday as well and then put back to sleep.,2023-02-11
00:00:48.549,00:00:53.757,Now each time she gets put back to sleep&nbsp; she will forget that she was ever awakened.,2023-02-11
00:00:53.757,00:00:58.746,In the brief period anytime she's awake she will be told&nbsp; no information.,2023-02-11
00:00:58.746,00:01:01.298,But she'll be asked one question:,2023-02-11
00:01:01.298,00:01:05.818,What do you believe is the probability that the&nbsp; coin came up heads?,2023-02-11
00:01:05.818,00:01:07.791,so how should she answer?,2023-02-11
00:01:07.791,00:01:11.921,Feel free to pause the video and answer the question&nbsp; for yourself right now.,2023-02-11
00:01:12.421,00:01:14.220,This was my reaction after,2023-02-11
00:01:14.220,00:01:16.534,hearing the problem for the first time.,2023-02-11
00:01:16.534,00:01:21.006,I mean the&nbsp;intuitive answer that pops into my head is clearly one in three.,2023-02-11
00:01:21.006,00:01:23.325,It could be the Monday when it came&nbsp;up heads.,2023-02-11
00:01:23.325,00:01:27.435,Or it could be the Monday when it came up Tails.,2023-02-11
00:01:27.435,00:01:31.084,Or it could be the Tuesday when it came&nbsp; up Tails.,2023-02-11
00:01:31.084,00:01:35.901,But you know what's really interesting is you just answered that the probability of a&nbsp;coin coming up heads is one-third.,2023-02-11
00:01:35.901,00:01:39.786,I think a lot of this comes down to what specific question is&nbsp; asked of her.,2023-02-11
00:01:39.786,00:01:43.328,What is the probability that a Fair coin flipped gives heads?,2023-02-11
00:01:43.328,00:01:45.000,That's 50 percent.,2023-02-11
00:01:45.000,00:01:49.131,What is the&nbsp;probability that the coin came up heads?,2023-02-11
00:01:49.131,00:01:51.725,I would say the answer is a third from her perspective.,2023-02-11
00:01:52.691,00:01:56.645,Yeah it's it's remarkably the same question.,2023-02-11
00:01:56.645,00:02:00.833,The simple reason why Sleeping Beauty should say&nbsp; the probability of heads is one half,2023-02-11
00:02:00.833,00:02:03.076,is because she knows the coin is fair.,2023-02-11
00:02:03.076,00:02:06.863,Nothing changes between&nbsp; when the coin is flipped and when she wakes up,2023-02-11
00:02:06.863,00:02:12.518,and she knew for a fact that she would be woken up and&nbsp; she receives no new information when that happens.,2023-02-11
00:02:13.440,00:02:18.540,"Imagine that instead of flipping the coin&nbsp; after she's asleep, the experimenters flip&nbsp;&nbsp;",2023-02-11
00:02:18.540,00:02:24.290,"the coin first and ask her immediately: ""what's the&nbsp; probability that the coin came up heads?""",2023-02-11
00:02:24.290,00:02:30.548,Well she would certainly say one half so why should&nbsp; anything change after she goes to sleep and&nbsp;&nbsp;wakes up,2023-02-11
00:02:30.548,00:02:35.822,This is known as the Halfer position.&nbsp; But there is another way to look at it.,2023-02-11
00:02:35.822,00:02:38.981,Others would argue that something does change when she's&nbsp; awakened.,2023-02-11
00:02:38.981,00:02:41.870,I mean it seems like she gets no new information.,2023-02-11
00:02:41.870,00:02:46.725,There are no calendars no one tells&nbsp; her anything and she knew that she would be woken up.,2023-02-11
00:02:46.725,00:02:49.400,But she actually learns something important.,2023-02-11
00:02:49.400,00:02:53.952,She&nbsp;learns that she's gone from existing in a reality where there are two possible states.,2023-02-11
00:02:53.952,00:02:56.740,The coin came&nbsp;up either heads or tails,2023-02-11
00:02:56.740,00:03:03.632,"to existing in a reality where there are three possible states: Monday heads,&nbsp;Monday Tails or Tuesday tails.",2023-02-11
00:03:03.632,00:03:07.848,And therefore she should assign equal probability to each of these&nbsp;three outcomes,2023-02-11
00:03:07.848,00:03:10.927,where Heads only occurred in one.,2023-02-11
00:03:10.927,00:03:15.000,So the probability that the coin came up heads is&nbsp;one-third.,2023-02-11
00:03:15.000,00:03:18.060,This is known as the thirder position,2023-02-11
00:03:18.060,00:03:22.920,Now I know it seems wrong to suggest that a Fair&nbsp; coin should have a one-third probability of coming&nbsp;&nbsp;,2023-02-11
00:03:22.920,00:03:28.020,up heads but that's because the question she's&nbsp; asked is subtly different. The implied question&nbsp;&nbsp;,2023-02-11
00:03:28.020,00:03:34.632,"is: ""Given you're awake, what's the probability that&nbsp; the coin came up heads?"" And that is one-third",2023-02-11
00:03:34.632,00:03:39.540,Now halfers would counter that just because there are&nbsp; three possible outcomes doesn't mean they are each&nbsp;&nbsp;,2023-02-11
00:03:39.540,00:03:44.220,equally likely. In the Monty Hall problem for&nbsp; example the contestant ultimately has to choose&nbsp;&nbsp;,2023-02-11
00:03:44.220,00:03:49.800,between two doors. But it'd be wrong to assign&nbsp; them 50/50 odds. The prize is actually twice&nbsp;&nbsp;,2023-02-11
00:03:49.800,00:03:52.776,as likely to be behind one door than the other.,2023-02-11
00:03:52.776,00:03:57.929,In the Sleeping Beauty problem we know a heads outcome and a Tails outcome are equally likely.,2023-02-11
00:03:57.929,00:04:01.260,So the chance of waking up on Monday with heads is 50 percent,2023-02-11
00:04:01.260,00:04:06.318,And the chance of waking up on Monday or&nbsp; Tuesday with Tails should be 50 percent.,2023-02-11
00:04:06.318,00:04:11.901,Therefore the Tails probability gets split across two days 25&nbsp;percent each.,2023-02-11
00:04:11.901,00:04:17.299,"but if you repeat the experiment over and over, which you can try for yourself by repeatedly&nbsp;flipping a coin,",2023-02-11
00:04:17.299,00:04:22.486,"you find she wakes up a third of the time Monday heads, a third of the time Monday&nbsp;tails,",2023-02-11
00:04:22.486,00:04:30.334,"and a third of the time Tuesday tails, not 50-25-25 like the previous analysis would suggest.",2023-02-11
00:04:30.334,00:04:34.236,So if you were Sleeping Beauty and you were awakened and asked,2023-02-11
00:04:34.236,00:04:36.730,"""What's the probability&nbsp;the coin came up heads?""",2023-02-11
00:04:36.730,00:04:38.340,What would you say?,2023-02-11
00:04:38.340,00:04:42.000,If you would say one-third then hit the like&nbsp;button.,2023-02-11
00:04:42.000,00:04:45.418,"If you would say one half, hit the dislike button.",2023-02-11
00:04:45.418,00:04:47.916,The answer may seem obvious to you,2023-02-11
00:04:47.916,00:04:52.407,but you&nbsp;should know that to other people the other answer seems equally obvious.,2023-02-11
00:04:52.407,00:04:59.790,And that's why hundreds and&nbsp; hundreds of philosophy papers have been published on this problem over the past 22 years.,2023-02-11
00:04:59.790,00:05:02.615,There have&nbsp;been many variations of this problem,2023-02-11
00:05:02.615,00:05:08.795,like what if instead of being woken up twice if the coin lands&nbsp; tails she's instead woken up a million times?,2023-02-11
00:05:08.795,00:05:12.599,If the coin comes up heads she's still woken only&nbsp; once.,2023-02-11
00:05:12.599,00:05:19.332,"Doesn't it seem absurd in this case, when Sleeping Beauty wakes up, to say that it was just&nbsp; as likely that a coin landed heads as tails?",2023-02-11
00:05:19.332,00:05:24.744,When we know there are a million more wakeups in the&nbsp; tails case than in the heads case.,2023-02-11
00:05:24.744,00:05:29.123,"I mean if you reach into a bag of one white marble and a million&nbsp;black marbles,",2023-02-11
00:05:29.123,00:05:32.672,what are the chances that you pull out that one white marble?,2023-02-11
00:05:32.672,00:05:36.765,I was pretty convinced&nbsp; by this and I considered myself a thirder,2023-02-11
00:05:36.765,00:05:41.425,but this same argument is used to convince people that&nbsp; we're living in a simulation.,2023-02-11
00:05:41.425,00:05:45.150,"The thinking goes that our computing technology has improved so&nbsp;dramatically,",2023-02-11
00:05:45.150,00:05:47.395,"even over just the last 40 years,",2023-02-11
00:05:47.395,00:05:55.002,that we can imagine a time in the not-too-distant&nbsp; future when we can create a completely realistic simulation of our world.,2023-02-11
00:05:55.002,00:06:00.432,And once that occurs it&nbsp; should be trivial to make unlimited copies of that simulation.,2023-02-11
00:06:00.432,00:06:03.154,"And then if you were to ask someone if&nbsp; they're living in a simulation,",2023-02-11
00:06:03.154,00:06:05.552,they would have to admit that they probably are,2023-02-11
00:06:05.552,00:06:11.250,because there are&nbsp;many more instances of that existence than the one true external reality.,2023-02-11
00:06:11.404,00:06:15.991,But how do we know that&nbsp; this hasn't happened already and that we're living inside a simulation?,2023-02-11
00:06:15.991,00:06:20.060,I mean if it can happen then&nbsp; it probably has happened and we are living in a simulation,2023-02-11
00:06:21.092,00:06:24.956,This seems like the logical conclusion&nbsp; of the third or world view.,2023-02-11
00:06:25.246,00:06:30.135,Now I personally don't buy that I'm living in a simulation and I think&nbsp;most people don't buy it.,2023-02-11
00:06:30.135,00:06:32.170,But maybe that's just illogical bias.,2023-02-11
00:06:32.170,00:06:37.234,But there's another thought&nbsp;experiment that makes me seriously reconsider the third or position.,2023-02-11
00:06:37.234,00:06:41.213,Let's say there's a soccer&nbsp; game between a really great team like Brazil,2023-02-11
00:06:41.213,00:06:45.000,and a less World dominating team like Canada.,2023-02-11
00:06:45.000,00:06:48.087,So the&nbsp;odds are 80:20 in Brazil's favor,2023-02-11
00:06:48.087,00:06:51.808,now a researcher is going to put you to sleep before the game&nbsp; starts.,2023-02-11
00:06:51.808,00:06:55.097,And if Brazil wins they'll wake you up one time,2023-02-11
00:06:55.097,00:07:00.463,But if Canada wins they'll wake you up 30&nbsp; times in a row and just like Sleeping Beauty,2023-02-11
00:07:00.463,00:07:02.753,you won't remember if you've been woken before.,2023-02-11
00:07:02.753,00:07:06.116,Okay&nbsp;so the game is about to start you fall asleep...,2023-02-11
00:07:07.500,00:07:12.096,and now you're woken up. Who do you think won the&nbsp; game?,2023-02-11
00:07:12.096,00:07:14.869,The thirder would say Canada,2023-02-11
00:07:14.869,00:07:20.100,but I would almost certainly say Brazil. I mean why should I&nbsp; give any weight to what the researcher would have&nbsp;&nbsp;,2023-02-11
00:07:20.100,00:07:24.700,done if Canada had one when I'm fairly confident&nbsp; that they won't?,2023-02-11
00:07:24.700,00:07:30.069,"To extend this, let's say Brazil plays Canada five times and we do this experiment&nbsp;each time.",2023-02-11
00:07:30.069,00:07:36.948,Well then if you say Brazil each time you're woken up you'll probably be right about&nbsp;four out of five of the games.,2023-02-11
00:07:36.948,00:07:43.320,but if you said Canada every time you would be wrong about those&nbsp;four games but right 30 times in a row when you're&nbsp;&nbsp;,2023-02-11
00:07:43.320,00:07:48.780,repeatedly asked about Canada's one victory. If&nbsp; you stand to win a bet by correctly answering&nbsp;&nbsp;,2023-02-11
00:07:48.780,00:07:53.820,the question then by all means you should bet&nbsp; on Canada. But if you want to correctly pick the&nbsp;&nbsp;,2023-02-11
00:07:53.820,00:07:58.980,winner of more of the games well then you should&nbsp; say Brazil. And this is what's at the heart of the&nbsp;&nbsp;,2023-02-11
00:07:58.980,00:08:04.140,dispute between Halfers and Thirders in the Sleeping&nbsp; Beauty problem. If you want to be right about the&nbsp;&nbsp;,2023-02-11
00:08:04.140,00:08:09.600,outcome of the coin tosses well you should say the&nbsp; probability of heads is a half but if you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;,2023-02-11
00:08:09.600,00:08:16.020,answer more questionings correctly well then you&nbsp; should say one-third. I want to leave you with one&nbsp;&nbsp;,2023-02-11
00:08:16.020,00:08:21.540,last thought experiment. Imagine that you know for&nbsp; a fact that before our universe began there was&nbsp;&nbsp;,2023-02-11
00:08:21.540,00:08:27.780,a coin flip and if it came up heads only a single&nbsp; Universe would be created. But if it came up Tails&nbsp;&nbsp;,2023-02-11
00:08:27.780,00:08:33.300,a quasi-infinite Multiverse would be created and&nbsp; in each of those Multiverse universes you'd find&nbsp;&nbsp;,2023-02-11
00:08:33.300,00:08:36.334,every possible variation of Earth and the people&nbsp; on it,2023-02-11
00:08:36.334,00:08:38.640,In some versions there would be no Earth,2023-02-11
00:08:42.120,00:08:47.880,Now you becoming conscious is just like Sleeping&nbsp; Beauty waking up. There's no way to tell if&nbsp;&nbsp;,2023-02-11
00:08:47.880,00:08:53.160,you're in that single universe or in one of the&nbsp; Multiverse universes but you know there are a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;,2023-02-11
00:08:53.160,00:09:01.080,more of them. So would you think that you're for&nbsp; sure in the Multiverse. Or are the chances 50/50?,2023-02-11
00:09:04.920,00:09:10.440,The best way to develop intuition about&nbsp; probability is by working through scenarios&nbsp;&nbsp;,2023-02-11
00:09:10.440,00:09:15.540,or running simulations like we did for Sleeping&nbsp; Beauty. This video's sponsor Brilliant offers&nbsp;&nbsp;,2023-02-11
