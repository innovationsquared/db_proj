00:00:00.000,00:00:03.750,- This is one of the strangest materials I have ever seen.,2023-01-23
00:00:03.750,00:00:06.030,It is not sticky at all.,2023-01-23
00:00:06.030,00:00:10.383,You can't even stick regular tape to it.,2023-01-23
00:00:11.700,00:00:15.423,"But if I drape it over this tomato,",2023-01-23
00:00:16.590,00:00:18.540,"it holds it up,",2023-01-23
00:00:18.540,00:00:20.940,"unless you turn it upside-down,",2023-01-23
00:00:20.940,00:00:23.490,in which case it just falls off.,2023-01-23
00:00:23.490,00:00:26.010,Now does it only stick to fruit?,2023-01-23
00:00:26.010,00:00:28.980,"No, it'll stick to a water bottle or a bag of chips,",2023-01-23
00:00:28.980,00:00:32.430,basically any approximately smooth surface.,2023-01-23
00:00:32.430,00:00:33.390,And that's because,2023-01-23
00:00:33.390,00:00:36.693,this material is made to mimic gecko skin.,2023-01-23
00:00:39.060,00:00:40.200,Artificial gecko skin,2023-01-23
00:00:40.200,00:00:43.380,comes out of Professor Mark Cutkosky's Stanford lab,2023-01-23
00:00:43.380,00:00:46.740,"and it has now been used on robotic grippers,",2023-01-23
00:00:46.740,00:00:49.500,on tiny robots that can pull way more,2023-01-23
00:00:49.500,00:00:51.060,"than their weight,",2023-01-23
00:00:51.060,00:00:52.770,on a robot that floats,2023-01-23
00:00:52.770,00:00:55.410,around the International Space Station,2023-01-23
00:00:55.410,00:00:57.480,and even enabling a person,2023-01-23
00:00:57.480,00:01:01.050,"to scale a glass wall, Spider-man style.",2023-01-23
00:01:01.050,00:01:02.760,It all started with a competition,2023-01-23
00:01:02.760,00:01:06.330,to make a robot that climbs a vertical wall without suction.,2023-01-23
00:01:06.330,00:01:07.260,- Here's sticky type.,2023-01-23
00:01:07.260,00:01:08.550,Everybody's familiar with it.,2023-01-23
00:01:08.550,00:01:10.530,You press it on and it sticks.,2023-01-23
00:01:10.530,00:01:12.150,Sticks pretty hard actually.,2023-01-23
00:01:12.150,00:01:13.710,And then you peel it off.,2023-01-23
00:01:13.710,00:01:15.210,Here's gecko material.,2023-01-23
00:01:15.210,00:01:16.350,And the first thing you notice,2023-01-23
00:01:16.350,00:01:17.820,is that it's actually...,2023-01-23
00:01:17.820,00:01:19.200,"It's not sticky at all,",2023-01-23
00:01:19.200,00:01:22.350,but if I lift it from the middle I can lift a football.,2023-01-23
00:01:22.350,00:01:24.360,"You might say, ""Well you could do that",2023-01-23
00:01:24.360,00:01:26.880,"if you had this other sticky tape"", right?",2023-01-23
00:01:26.880,00:01:28.980,"Well, yes, but if I had the other sticky tape",2023-01-23
00:01:28.980,00:01:30.450,it wouldn't do that.,2023-01-23
00:01:30.450,00:01:32.760,And that's important because if you're a small robot,2023-01-23
00:01:32.760,00:01:34.560,"trying to climb a wall,",2023-01-23
00:01:34.560,00:01:36.570,you can't afford to have something,2023-01-23
00:01:36.570,00:01:38.340,"like chewing gum on your feet,",2023-01-23
00:01:38.340,00:01:40.950,'cause then every step you take is effort.,2023-01-23
00:01:40.950,00:01:43.740,What you want is something that only grabs,2023-01-23
00:01:43.740,00:01:45.300,"when you need it to,",2023-01-23
00:01:45.300,00:01:47.670,and that's kind of the main principle,2023-01-23
00:01:47.670,00:01:49.559,of our gecko-inspired adhesive.,2023-01-23
00:01:49.559,00:01:52.050,Here this is an early prototype of the sticky bot,2023-01-23
00:01:52.050,00:01:53.610,gecko-inspired robot.,2023-01-23
00:01:53.610,00:01:55.800,This got us into a a long effort,2023-01-23
00:01:55.800,00:01:57.300,to understand what is it,2023-01-23
00:01:57.300,00:01:58.980,"that makes gecko adhesion work,",2023-01-23
00:01:58.980,00:02:00.990,having something which grips,2023-01-23
00:02:00.990,00:02:02.133,but is not sticky.,2023-01-23
00:02:04.770,00:02:06.810,- [Derek] Geckos are incredible climbers.,2023-01-23
00:02:06.810,00:02:10.110,"They scale walls and even walk on ceilings,",2023-01-23
00:02:10.110,00:02:13.170,but for a long time we didn't know how they did it.,2023-01-23
00:02:13.170,00:02:15.450,They don't use hairs or spikes,2023-01-23
00:02:15.450,00:02:17.700,like spiders or other insects.,2023-01-23
00:02:17.700,00:02:20.610,You might think they'd have tiny little suction cups,2023-01-23
00:02:20.610,00:02:21.900,"at the end of their feet,",2023-01-23
00:02:21.900,00:02:22.890,but their adhesion,2023-01-23
00:02:22.890,00:02:25.800,is actually way stronger than suction cups.,2023-01-23
00:02:25.800,00:02:27.990,- [Mark] A gecko can easily hang its entire weight,2023-01-23
00:02:27.990,00:02:29.910,from just part of one toe.,2023-01-23
00:02:29.910,00:02:31.830,- [Derek] The clue to how this works can be seen,2023-01-23
00:02:31.830,00:02:34.140,if you zoom in on a gecko's toe,2023-01-23
00:02:34.140,00:02:35.580,- [Mark] These are called lamella.,2023-01-23
00:02:35.580,00:02:37.620,"They're regions of stalks,",2023-01-23
00:02:37.620,00:02:39.420,which are called seta.,2023-01-23
00:02:39.420,00:02:41.010,And the seta branch,2023-01-23
00:02:41.010,00:02:43.680,"into these incredibly fine structures called spatula,",2023-01-23
00:02:43.680,00:02:47.010,which are less than one micrometer across.,2023-01-23
00:02:47.010,00:02:47.850,- [Derek] And that's important,2023-01-23
00:02:47.850,00:02:50.700,because the physical principle they use to stick,2023-01-23
00:02:50.700,00:02:53.250,is actually incredibly weak.,2023-01-23
00:02:53.250,00:02:54.930,It's not like an ionic bond,2023-01-23
00:02:54.930,00:02:56.730,where atoms are attracted to each other,2023-01-23
00:02:56.730,00:02:58.020,because one is positive,2023-01-23
00:02:58.020,00:02:59.430,and the other is negative.,2023-01-23
00:02:59.430,00:03:02.130,It's not even a hydrogen bond like in water,2023-01-23
00:03:02.130,00:03:04.620,where part of the molecule is slightly positive,2023-01-23
00:03:04.620,00:03:06.690,and the other part is slightly negative.,2023-01-23
00:03:06.690,00:03:11.690,"No, geckos rely on the attraction between neutral atoms.",2023-01-23
00:03:11.940,00:03:13.533,So how does that work?,2023-01-23
00:03:14.370,00:03:17.310,Say a gecko is climbing up a glass window.,2023-01-23
00:03:17.310,00:03:18.930,The gecko atoms are neutral,2023-01-23
00:03:18.930,00:03:20.850,"and the glass atoms are neutral,",2023-01-23
00:03:20.850,00:03:22.860,but at any particular instant,2023-01-23
00:03:22.860,00:03:24.900,the electrons around in atom,2023-01-23
00:03:24.900,00:03:28.410,are not perfectly evenly distributed about the nucleus.,2023-01-23
00:03:28.410,00:03:31.470,They may be a little bit more on one side than the other.,2023-01-23
00:03:31.470,00:03:32.880,And this makes the atom,2023-01-23
00:03:32.880,00:03:36.330,momentarily a little positively charged on one side,2023-01-23
00:03:36.330,00:03:39.060,and a little negatively charged on the other side.,2023-01-23
00:03:39.060,00:03:42.120,"Now if there's a neighboring atom really close to it,",2023-01-23
00:03:42.120,00:03:44.670,"say an atom for the glass is within a few nanometers,",2023-01-23
00:03:44.670,00:03:47.760,this charge can induce a complimentary charge imbalance,2023-01-23
00:03:47.760,00:03:49.200,on the glass atom.,2023-01-23
00:03:49.200,00:03:51.480,So now the electrons from the glass atom,2023-01-23
00:03:51.480,00:03:54.000,are attracted to the nucleus of the gecko atom,2023-01-23
00:03:54.000,00:03:55.590,and vice versa.,2023-01-23
00:03:55.590,00:03:57.540,There is a very weak force of attraction,2023-01-23
00:03:57.540,00:03:59.580,between gecko and glass.,2023-01-23
00:03:59.580,00:04:03.090,And this is known as a Van der Waal's Force.,2023-01-23
00:04:03.090,00:04:05.190,"Van der Waal's Forces are, at least in part,",2023-01-23
00:04:05.190,00:04:06.390,"why gauge blocks,",2023-01-23
00:04:06.390,00:04:08.070,"smooth flat pieces of steel,",2023-01-23
00:04:08.070,00:04:09.720,can stick together.,2023-01-23
00:04:09.720,00:04:10.890,- It's there all the time.,2023-01-23
00:04:10.890,00:04:12.300,"If you have a car with, you know,",2023-01-23
00:04:12.300,00:04:14.730,you can put these vinyl sheets on the back window,2023-01-23
00:04:14.730,00:04:16.800,so that your kids don't get like excessive sun,2023-01-23
00:04:16.800,00:04:18.180,when they're in the car seat.,2023-01-23
00:04:18.180,00:04:19.710,That's also Van der Waal's Force.,2023-01-23
00:04:19.710,00:04:21.720,- [Derek] But generally we don't notice,2023-01-23
00:04:21.720,00:04:22.980,Van der Waal's Forces.,2023-01-23
00:04:22.980,00:04:25.230,We don't feel them with our fingers,2023-01-23
00:04:25.230,00:04:27.840,"because at least on the molecular scale,",2023-01-23
00:04:27.840,00:04:30.690,our skin is incredibly bumpy.,2023-01-23
00:04:30.690,00:04:31.740,Touching a piece of glass,2023-01-23
00:04:31.740,00:04:35.430,is like putting a mountain range on top of a flat plane.,2023-01-23
00:04:35.430,00:04:38.460,There aren't many points of close contact.,2023-01-23
00:04:38.460,00:04:42.153,Geckos overcome this using all those tiny branches.,2023-01-23
00:04:43.200,00:04:44.070,- So this means that,2023-01-23
00:04:44.070,00:04:46.110,"when the gecko puts its foot down,",2023-01-23
00:04:46.110,00:04:49.230,it has a very large intimate area of contact,2023-01-23
00:04:49.230,00:04:51.000,It's almost as if you were pouring glue,2023-01-23
00:04:51.000,00:04:51.833,on the surface,2023-01-23
00:04:51.833,00:04:52.863,and letting it flow.,2023-01-23
00:04:53.790,00:04:56.280,And that's what makes the adhesion work.,2023-01-23
00:04:56.280,00:04:57.420,- [Derek] Replicating the gecko's,2023-01-23
00:04:57.420,00:04:58.980,intricate branching structures,2023-01-23
00:04:58.980,00:05:00.840,is currently impossible.,2023-01-23
00:05:00.840,00:05:02.820,- We cannot make what the gecko has.,2023-01-23
00:05:02.820,00:05:03.653,We can't.,2023-01-23
00:05:03.653,00:05:04.486,"- [Derek] That structure,",2023-01-23
00:05:04.486,00:05:05.678,that really fine branching structure.,2023-01-23
00:05:05.678,00:05:07.920,- That sophisticated branching structure.,2023-01-23
00:05:07.920,00:05:10.293,but we can make a more crude approximation.,2023-01-23
00:05:11.820,00:05:12.840,"- [Derek] Under a microscope,",2023-01-23
00:05:12.840,00:05:15.210,you can see that the artificial gecko adhesive,2023-01-23
00:05:15.210,00:05:18.270,is covered in rows of sharp wedges.,2023-01-23
00:05:18.270,00:05:22.110,The tips are around one or two micrometers wide.,2023-01-23
00:05:22.110,00:05:26.100,That's a hundred times narrower than a human hair.,2023-01-23
00:05:26.100,00:05:28.080,To create such fine structures,2023-01-23
00:05:28.080,00:05:31.050,requires a labor-intensive process.,2023-01-23
00:05:31.050,00:05:34.710,A block of wax is used as the base for a mold,2023-01-23
00:05:34.710,00:05:37.560,and then a razor blade is repeatedly pressed,2023-01-23
00:05:37.560,00:05:40.890,into the block creating wedge-shaped indents.,2023-01-23
00:05:40.890,00:05:43.590,A silicone polymer is poured into the mold,2023-01-23
00:05:43.590,00:05:45.840,and a backing material is attached.,2023-01-23
00:05:45.840,00:05:47.586,- This is silicone?,2023-01-23
00:05:47.586,00:05:50.174,- [Lab Worker] So it's called Sylgard 170.,2023-01-23
00:05:50.174,00:05:52.050,"And it is a type of silicone, yes.",2023-01-23
00:05:52.050,00:05:53.670,"- [Derek] And after about 24 hours,",2023-01-23
00:05:53.670,00:05:56.760,the adhesive is cured and ready to go.,2023-01-23
00:05:56.760,00:05:58.710,And that's what it looks like.,2023-01-23
00:05:58.710,00:06:00.630,But the mold can only be used a few times,2023-01-23
00:06:00.630,00:06:02.790,before the quality of the adhesive declines,2023-01-23
00:06:02.790,00:06:05.370,and you have to start all over again.,2023-01-23
00:06:05.370,00:06:07.320,"- This sharp wedge structure,",2023-01-23
00:06:07.320,00:06:09.120,which has this interesting property,2023-01-23
00:06:09.120,00:06:11.640,"that when you first bring it up to a surface,",2023-01-23
00:06:11.640,00:06:14.940,the only part in contact is these tips.,2023-01-23
00:06:14.940,00:06:16.260,So therefore it's not sticky,2023-01-23
00:06:16.260,00:06:19.290,because there's no Van der Waal's Force worth mentioning.,2023-01-23
00:06:19.290,00:06:21.600,"As you load it in shear,",2023-01-23
00:06:21.600,00:06:23.320,these things all bend over,2023-01-23
00:06:24.240,00:06:25.560,"and we get a much larger,",2023-01-23
00:06:25.560,00:06:28.080,in fact almost continuous contact area.,2023-01-23
00:06:28.080,00:06:29.850,"And so like the gecko,",2023-01-23
00:06:29.850,00:06:32.340,we have some Van der Waal's Forces to work with,2023-01-23
00:06:32.340,00:06:34.023,and that's what give us adhesion.,2023-01-23
00:06:35.010,00:06:36.417,- [Derek] So to make the adhesive stick,2023-01-23
00:06:36.417,00:06:38.910,"you have to pull it parallel to the surface,",2023-01-23
00:06:38.910,00:06:41.460,"that's known as a shear force,",2023-01-23
00:06:41.460,00:06:43.200,and you have to pull it in the direction,2023-01-23
00:06:43.200,00:06:44.460,that will bend the wedges,2023-01-23
00:06:44.460,00:06:46.980,so that they make contact with the surface.,2023-01-23
00:06:46.980,00:06:48.930,"If you pull it in any other direction,",2023-01-23
00:06:48.930,00:06:50.370,it won't stick.,2023-01-23
00:06:50.370,00:06:53.130,This makes it easy to pull the adhesive,2023-01-23
00:06:53.130,00:06:54.480,straight off the surface.,2023-01-23
00:06:54.480,00:06:57.420,"I mean, there is basically no contact force.",2023-01-23
00:06:57.420,00:06:58.610,- [Lab Worker] And so the way we clean this,2023-01-23
00:06:58.610,00:06:59.640,"is just with tape,",2023-01-23
00:06:59.640,00:07:02.477,"because tape doesn't stick to the Sylgard,",2023-01-23
00:07:02.477,00:07:03.653,but the dust particles do.,2023-01-23
00:07:04.920,00:07:06.330,- [Derek] They used this property,2023-01-23
00:07:06.330,00:07:07.950,to create an incredibly small,2023-01-23
00:07:07.950,00:07:10.710,and lightweight robot called MicroTug.,2023-01-23
00:07:10.710,00:07:13.020,"It weighs just 17 grams,",2023-01-23
00:07:13.020,00:07:16.740,but is able to pull a 20 kilogram weight.,2023-01-23
00:07:16.740,00:07:20.490,That's the equivalent of a human towing a blue whale.,2023-01-23
00:07:20.490,00:07:24.690,Just six of these tiny robots can tow a car.,2023-01-23
00:07:24.690,00:07:27.960,The gecko adhesive is on the underside of the MicroTugs.,2023-01-23
00:07:27.960,00:07:29.460,"So when they're pulling the car,",2023-01-23
00:07:29.460,00:07:31.170,the material is in shear,2023-01-23
00:07:31.170,00:07:33.360,and it sticks tight to the ground.,2023-01-23
00:07:33.360,00:07:35.070,"But as the car moves forward,",2023-01-23
00:07:35.070,00:07:36.780,the shear force decreases,2023-01-23
00:07:36.780,00:07:39.270,and so it's easy for the robot to pick itself up,2023-01-23
00:07:39.270,00:07:41.163,and move itself forward.,2023-01-23
00:07:42.720,00:07:44.400,The amount of pulling force attainable,2023-01-23
00:07:44.400,00:07:46.110,depends on the area of adhesive,2023-01-23
00:07:46.110,00:07:48.000,that's in contact with the surface.,2023-01-23
00:07:48.000,00:07:50.280,So they've developed a method for measuring this,2023-01-23
00:07:50.280,00:07:52.710,by shining light through acrylic.,2023-01-23
00:07:52.710,00:07:54.240,- [Tony] So what it does is shines the LED,2023-01-23
00:07:54.240,00:07:55.920,across the acrylic,2023-01-23
00:07:55.920,00:07:58.326,"and whenever there's a contact with the surface,",2023-01-23
00:07:58.326,00:08:00.570,it frustrates the ray,2023-01-23
00:08:00.570,00:08:03.030,and it shows you exactly where the contact area is.,2023-01-23
00:08:03.030,00:08:05.070,- [Derek] One square inch of contact area,2023-01-23
00:08:05.070,00:08:07.920,can support the weight of about four-and-a-half kilograms,2023-01-23
00:08:07.920,00:08:10.260,or 10 pounds.,2023-01-23
00:08:10.260,00:08:12.240,"Since the adhesive is directional,",2023-01-23
00:08:12.240,00:08:13.650,to grip an object,2023-01-23
00:08:13.650,00:08:17.190,two pieces of adhesive are attached in opposite directions.,2023-01-23
00:08:17.190,00:08:18.810,"So when you pull up,",2023-01-23
00:08:18.810,00:08:20.310,both sides are in shear,2023-01-23
00:08:20.310,00:08:22.053,and so they both stick.,2023-01-23
00:08:23.250,00:08:25.080,Two opposing pads of adhesive,2023-01-23
00:08:25.080,00:08:26.520,were actually tested on a robot,2023-01-23
00:08:26.520,00:08:28.770,on the international space station.,2023-01-23
00:08:28.770,00:08:29.880,- It's called Astrobee.,2023-01-23
00:08:29.880,00:08:31.200,"Think of it as like a drone,",2023-01-23
00:08:31.200,00:08:34.980,"a UAV, only actually uses a fan to push itself around",2023-01-23
00:08:34.980,00:08:36.570,inside the International Space Station.,2023-01-23
00:08:36.570,00:08:38.610,And the idea is that it could be there,2023-01-23
00:08:38.610,00:08:40.410,to take video,2023-01-23
00:08:40.410,00:08:42.600,or fetch something for astronauts.,2023-01-23
00:08:42.600,00:08:43.433,"Our proposal was,",2023-01-23
00:08:43.433,00:08:45.870,"""How about it should be able to float along gently",2023-01-23
00:08:45.870,00:08:48.027,"and stick itself to a wall, for example.",2023-01-23
00:08:48.027,00:08:50.520,Or pick up a big box.,2023-01-23
00:08:50.520,00:08:54.510,- [Astronaut] Our goal is to get that blue LED to turn green,2023-01-23
00:08:54.510,00:08:55.980,- Because there's no gravity.,2023-01-23
00:08:55.980,00:08:58.320,You don't actually need a lot of force,2023-01-23
00:08:58.320,00:09:00.630,but you do want to be able to grab very gently,2023-01-23
00:09:00.630,00:09:01.950,and and release easily.,2023-01-23
00:09:01.950,00:09:04.710,And so we got the gecko adhesives up,2023-01-23
00:09:04.710,00:09:06.180,at International Space Station,2023-01-23
00:09:06.180,00:09:09.510,and it works just as well up there as it does down here.,2023-01-23
00:09:09.510,00:09:11.430,"- [Derek] This went to space, this was in the space station?",2023-01-23
00:09:11.430,00:09:14.010,- This was in Space station for about a year-and-a-half.,2023-01-23
00:09:14.010,00:09:14.843,- Wow.,2023-01-23
00:09:16.110,00:09:17.370,This principle can be extended,2023-01-23
00:09:17.370,00:09:18.930,to three pieces of adhesive,2023-01-23
00:09:18.930,00:09:20.580,so that when you pull them all in,2023-01-23
00:09:20.580,00:09:23.070,they can stick to a flat surface.,2023-01-23
00:09:23.070,00:09:26.100,"When it's at rest, these things are sticking up",2023-01-23
00:09:26.100,00:09:27.840,just a little bit,2023-01-23
00:09:27.840,00:09:29.460,"and then when you pull there,",2023-01-23
00:09:29.460,00:09:31.350,then they become flatter right?,2023-01-23
00:09:31.350,00:09:32.970,"- Yeah, the entire pad doesn't touch",2023-01-23
00:09:32.970,00:09:35.850,because it's both surfaces is not perfectly flat.,2023-01-23
00:09:35.850,00:09:38.013,And then once you activate it.,2023-01-23
00:09:39.720,00:09:42.420,"- [Derek] Oh yeah, I could totally see that.",2023-01-23
00:09:42.420,00:09:43.980,- [Tony] So I'm going to unplug the power,2023-01-23
00:09:43.980,00:09:46.440,so there's absolutely no power to it at all,2023-01-23
00:09:46.440,00:09:48.120,and it's still attach the surface.,2023-01-23
00:09:48.120,00:09:48.953,"- [Derek] Yeah, I was thinking",2023-01-23
00:09:48.953,00:09:51.000,that you'd have to keep the motor on but,2023-01-23
00:09:51.000,00:09:53.190,it just sort of like locks in position or what?,2023-01-23
00:09:53.190,00:09:55.050,"- [Tony] Yeah, as long as there's tiny bit of tension",2023-01-23
00:09:55.050,00:09:56.450,it just stays there forever.,2023-01-23
00:09:57.870,00:09:59.820,- [Derek] There are lots of potential applications,2023-01-23
00:09:59.820,00:10:00.660,"for this material,",2023-01-23
00:10:00.660,00:10:04.050,but the most obvious one is for robotic grippers.,2023-01-23
00:10:04.050,00:10:05.460,Since the adhesive sticks well,2023-01-23
00:10:05.460,00:10:07.500,"with just a small shear force,",2023-01-23
00:10:07.500,00:10:08.610,it's great for picking up,2023-01-23
00:10:08.610,00:10:10.770,delicate items like produce.,2023-01-23
00:10:10.770,00:10:14.820,"- These are meant to be smart gecko palms, basically.",2023-01-23
00:10:14.820,00:10:17.580,So we're trying to grasp with minimal squeezing.,2023-01-23
00:10:17.580,00:10:18.870,- We're not even really engaging,2023-01-23
00:10:18.870,00:10:20.430,the ratchet mechanism there.,2023-01-23
00:10:20.430,00:10:21.263,"- [Lab Worker] Yeah, not at all.",2023-01-23
00:10:21.263,00:10:22.650,- So it's like less than a Newton.,2023-01-23
00:10:22.650,00:10:24.850,It can also grab bulky items,2023-01-23
00:10:26.280,00:10:28.770,or palm a basketball.,2023-01-23
00:10:28.770,00:10:31.950,Now can the gecko adhesive pull a car?,2023-01-23
00:10:31.950,00:10:34.980,"They have hooked this one up to this rope,",2023-01-23
00:10:34.980,00:10:37.260,"which is connected to a winch here,",2023-01-23
00:10:37.260,00:10:39.930,but the winch is not actually secured.,2023-01-23
00:10:39.930,00:10:43.800,It is tethered back to four pieces of gecko adhesive,2023-01-23
00:10:43.800,00:10:46.170,which are just sitting on this pipe.,2023-01-23
00:10:46.170,00:10:47.430,"So the question is,",2023-01-23
00:10:47.430,00:10:49.920,can these four pieces of gecko adhesive,2023-01-23
00:10:49.920,00:10:53.534,anchor the winch as it pulls that car back?,2023-01-23

00:11:12.630,00:11:13.920,Could I pull these off?,2023-01-23
00:11:13.920,00:11:14.753,"- [All] Yep, yeah.",2023-01-23
00:11:14.753,00:11:16.020,- How much does...,2023-01-23
00:11:16.020,00:11:18.813,like there was nothing holding it on.,2023-01-23
00:11:20.100,00:11:20.970,That's wild.,2023-01-23
00:11:20.970,00:11:23.010,But of course the application everyone wants,2023-01-23
00:11:23.010,00:11:25.200,is to be able to climb a building.,2023-01-23
