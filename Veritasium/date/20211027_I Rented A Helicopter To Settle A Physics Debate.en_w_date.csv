00:04:17.750,00:04:21.770,But first I want to discuss why the answer is B.,2021-10-27
00:04:21.770,00:04:24.750,"There are two external forces acting on the rope,",2021-10-27

00:04:30.720,00:04:32.970,these forces must be perfectly balanced,2021-10-27
00:04:32.970,00:04:35.060,by the tension in the rope.,2021-10-27
00:04:35.060,00:04:37.400,"Now, when I set out to do this experiment,",2021-10-27
00:04:37.400,00:04:38.970,I wondered if the rope would be affected,2021-10-27
00:04:38.970,00:04:41.960,"by the air pushed down by the helicopters rotor,",2021-10-27
00:04:41.960,00:04:43.840,but judging by our results.,2021-10-27
00:04:43.840,00:04:45.350,This was not the case.,2021-10-27
00:04:45.350,00:04:49.470,"- The rotor wash doesn't extend down below the helicopter,",2021-10-27
00:04:49.470,00:04:53.700,all that far. It dissipates pretty quickly.,2021-10-27
00:04:53.700,00:04:56.030,"- So, you can consider the air resistance on the rope",2021-10-27
00:04:56.030,00:05:00.100,as entirely due to its motion through still air.,2021-10-27
00:05:00.100,00:05:03.810,Imagine dividing the rope up into many short sections.,2021-10-27
00:05:03.810,00:05:06.090,Each section has the same weight,2021-10-27
00:05:06.090,00:05:09.110,and experiences the same amount of air resistance,2021-10-27
00:05:09.110,00:05:10.980,because it has the same cross-sectional area.,2021-10-27
00:05:10.980,00:05:13.230,And it's moving at the same speed.,2021-10-27
00:05:13.230,00:05:15.640,"Now, the tension in any section of the rope",2021-10-27
00:05:15.640,00:05:18.320,must balance the sum of the air resistance,2021-10-27
00:05:18.320,00:05:21.480,and weight of all the sections beneath it.,2021-10-27
00:05:21.480,00:05:24.720,"So, the tension is zero at the bottom of the rope,",2021-10-27
00:05:24.720,00:05:29.160,and it increases linearly up to a maximum at the top.,2021-10-27
00:05:29.160,00:05:31.600,"You can see the tension is small at the bottom of the rope,",2021-10-27
00:05:31.600,00:05:33.090,and that's why it wiggles around,2021-10-27
00:05:33.090,00:05:35.360,while the top is much steadier.,2021-10-27
00:05:35.360,00:05:37.710,"Now, although the magnitude of tension changes",2021-10-27
00:05:37.710,00:05:40.650,"throughout the rope, it's direction doesn't.",2021-10-27
00:05:40.650,00:05:43.380,And that's because the ratio of air resistance,2021-10-27
00:05:43.380,00:05:47.680,to weight is the same at every point along the rope.,2021-10-27
00:05:47.680,00:05:50.870,That is why a uniform flexible cable hangs,2021-10-27
00:05:50.870,00:05:54.540,in a straight diagonal line when pulled at constant speed,2021-10-27
00:05:54.540,00:05:56.060,by a helicopter.,2021-10-27

00:05:57.860,00:06:00.290,"the angle of the rope changes,",2021-10-27
00:06:00.290,00:06:02.660,but it still makes a diagonal straight line,2021-10-27
00:06:02.660,00:06:05.740,because the ratio of air resistance to weight,2021-10-27
00:06:05.740,00:06:09.243,is still constant along the entire length of the rope.,2021-10-27
00:06:10.420,00:06:12.177,"But this got me wondering,",2021-10-27
