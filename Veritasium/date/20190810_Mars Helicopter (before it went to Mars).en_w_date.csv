00:00:00.960,00:00:04.200,"I'm at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,",2019-08-10
00:00:04.200,00:00:08.800,and I'm here to see the first drone that's gonna fly on another planet.,2019-08-10
00:00:08.800,00:00:11.000,It's the Mars helicopter. Come on!,2019-08-10
00:00:11.000,00:00:14.840,- So this is our baby.,2019-08-10
00:00:14.840,00:00:15.800,- No way!,2019-08-10
00:00:15.800,00:00:16.880,- Yeah.,2019-08-10
00:00:16.880,00:00:22.600,- That thing right there is the actual machine that is going to take off and land on Mars.,2019-08-10
00:00:22.600,00:00:26.560,It's going with the Mars 2020 mission. That is the Mars helicopter.,2019-08-10
00:00:26.560,00:00:28.920,- This will be the first powered flight in another planet.,2019-08-10
00:00:30.140,00:00:31.700,- How awesome is that?,2019-08-10
00:00:31.720,00:00:34.600,"Now it's necessary to say first powered flight,",2019-08-10
00:00:34.600,00:00:39.920,"because in 1985, the Soviet Vega missions deployed two helium balloons on Venus.",2019-08-10
00:00:39.920,00:00:46.960,"They transmitted data for over forty six hours while floating at an altitude of 54 kilometers in Venus's dense atmosphere,",2019-08-10
00:00:46.960,00:00:51.320,which at the surface has a pressure of over 90 Earth atmospheres.,2019-08-10
00:00:51.320,00:00:56.560,"In contrast, Mars has very little atmosphere, only around 1% of Earth's.",2019-08-10
00:00:56.560,00:01:05.480,- Flying this kind of helicopter is equivalent to flying a similar helicopter on Earth at a hundred thousand feet.,2019-08-10
00:01:05.480,00:01:09.160,"So you don't know, you don't hear about many helicopters at a hundred thousand.",2019-08-10
00:01:09.160,00:01:11.280,I think forty thousand feet is probably the record.,2019-08-10
00:01:11.280,00:01:16.320,- I checked. Forty thousand feet is the record altitude reached by helicopters on Earth.,2019-08-10
00:01:16.320,00:01:19.720,"85,000 feet is the highest a plane has ever flown.",2019-08-10
00:01:19.720,00:01:23.520,"On Mars, the air is even thinner than that.",2019-08-10
00:01:23.520,00:01:26.560,- Right. In terms of density is 1% of what you have in this room.,2019-08-10
00:01:26.560,00:01:30.560,"So in this room, a cubic meter of air is about a kilogram.",2019-08-10
00:01:30.560,00:01:35.680,- Yeah - The same cubic meter on Mars will be about 15 grams to 18 grams.,2019-08-10
00:01:35.680,00:01:36.680,So that much,2019-08-10
00:01:36.680,00:01:38.520,- So you have to push a lot of air down.,2019-08-10
00:01:38.520,00:01:40.440,- Yes. You gotta get a lot of air flowing.,2019-08-10
00:01:40.440,00:01:45.400,"And so the obvious trick, if you will, is to spin the blades faster.",2019-08-10
00:01:45.400,00:01:49.320,- It can spin between 2300 rpm and 2900 rpm.,2019-08-10
00:01:49.320,00:01:50.240,- That is fast.,2019-08-10
00:01:50.240,00:01:51.240,- That is fast. Yes.,2019-08-10
00:01:51.800,00:01:55.200,- Here I'm trying to work out exactly how fast that is.,2019-08-10
00:01:55.200,00:02:01.040,"So I looked it up, and on Earth helicopters typically spin their rotors at around 500 rpm.",2019-08-10
00:02:01.040,00:02:05.360,So the Mars helicopter will have to spin its blades five times faster.,2019-08-10
00:02:05.360,00:02:11.320,"- But there are some limits you know, you really don't want to get the tips of the blades breaking the speed of sound,",2019-08-10
00:02:11.320,00:02:13.040,- cause then you have shockwaves and all sorts of,2019-08-10
00:02:13.040,00:02:18.760,"- and you get all kinds of funky aerodynamics and you know the transonic flows and things like that, so you don't want to go there.",2019-08-10
00:02:18.760,00:02:23.560,"So we, in our designs, keep the tip Mach numbers down to below about 0.7.",2019-08-10
00:02:23.560,00:02:25.040,- So 70% the speed sound.,2019-08-10
00:02:25.040,00:02:26.360,- Yeah. It was very conservative.,2019-08-10
00:02:26.360,00:02:32.080,- One advantage of flying on Mars is that gravity is only 38% of what it is on Earth.,2019-08-10
00:02:32.080,00:02:35.320,"Even so, making the craft lightweight was essential.",2019-08-10
00:02:35.320,00:02:40.560,- Keeping the mass of this vehicle contained during the entire design process has been the major challenge.,2019-08-10
00:02:40.560,00:02:44.000,- Every single part had to be considered.,2019-08-10
00:02:44.000,00:02:46.840,The entire vehicle is less than 1.8 kilograms,2019-08-10
00:02:46.840,00:02:47.360,- Woah!,2019-08-10
00:02:47.360,00:02:48.560,"- So, less than four pounds",2019-08-10
00:02:48.560,00:02:51.120,- That's about the same as this laptop.,2019-08-10
00:02:51.120,00:02:57.640,- The blades are a foam core with carbon fiber layup. Each of them is about 35 grams.,2019-08-10
00:02:57.640,00:02:58.040,- Wow.,2019-08-10
00:02:58.040,00:02:59.600,"- Yes, it's quite light. Yes.",2019-08-10
00:03:01.120,00:03:04.400,- 35 grams is the mass of six quarters.,2019-08-10
00:03:04.400,00:03:15.280,Think about that: two 35 gram blades lifting an 1800 gram helicopter by spinning 40 times per second in just 1% of Earth's atmosphere.,2019-08-10
00:03:15.280,00:03:17.360,How long can it fly for?,2019-08-10
00:03:18.080,00:03:20.560,- It's designed to fly up to 90 seconds.,2019-08-10
00:03:20.560,00:03:22.000,- A minute and a half of flight.,2019-08-10
00:03:22.000,00:03:22.480,- Yes.,2019-08-10
00:03:22.480,00:03:24.560,"- To me that sounds like forever,",2019-08-10
00:03:24.560,00:03:28.280,"when you're talking about another planet, flying autonomously by itself",2019-08-10
00:03:28.280,00:03:30.840,"in 1/100 earth atmosphere, I mean, come on!",2019-08-10
00:03:30.840,00:03:32.440,"Like, that's a long time!",2019-08-10
00:03:32.440,00:03:33.120,- That is. Yeah.,2019-08-10
00:03:33.120,00:03:37.520,"- One of the questions I had was, why didn't they use a quadcopter design?",2019-08-10
00:03:37.520,00:03:43.600,"Well, because on Mars, the blades have to be so long that the whole craft would barely fit on the rover.",2019-08-10
00:03:43.600,00:03:47.560,Two counter-rotating propellers provide the simplest design.,2019-08-10
00:03:47.560,00:03:52.200,They also generate lift more efficiently when stacked on top of each other.,2019-08-10
00:03:52.200,00:03:58.280,- The bottom rotor sees the sort of the more compactified flow.,2019-08-10
00:03:58.280,00:04:02.800,"The top one pulls it, the bottom one sees sort of a more concentrated flow.",2019-08-10
00:04:02.800,00:04:06.040,So the bottom rotor actually can do better than if they were separated apart.,2019-08-10
00:04:06.040,00:04:10.760,- But how do you test a helicopter designed for conditions on Mars on Earth?,2019-08-10
00:04:10.760,00:04:16.560,What would happen if you just took your Mars helicopter and you tried to take off on Earth?,2019-08-10
00:04:16.560,00:04:17.960,- It would just make a lot of noise.,2019-08-10
00:04:17.960,00:04:18.520,- Really?,2019-08-10
00:04:18.520,00:04:20.440,- And it probably wouldn't get the full head speed either...,2019-08-10
00:04:20.440,00:04:22.240,- because of how much atmosphere we've got.,2019-08-10
00:04:22.240,00:04:23.920,"- Exactly, it's like trying to swim in a thick soup.",2019-08-10
00:04:23.920,00:04:28.040,We have a really amazing chamber here on lab called the 25-foot space simulator.,2019-08-10
00:04:28.040,00:04:31.520,And in that chamber you could simulate any kind of atmosphere you want.,2019-08-10
00:04:31.520,00:04:34.360,"You can go to Martian pressures, you can stay at Earth pressures, whatever you want.",2019-08-10
00:04:34.360,00:04:38.240,"But that only took care of half of the problem, that was the aerodynamics aspect of it.",2019-08-10
00:04:38.240,00:04:40.200,There's the other part which is the gravity.,2019-08-10
00:04:40.200,00:04:43.600,"We needed a way to fake Mars' gravity here on Earth,",2019-08-10
00:04:43.600,00:04:46.760,and the best way that we could figure out to do that was a gravity offload.,2019-08-10
00:04:46.760,00:04:50.040,"- Gravity offload just means pulling up on the helicopter,",2019-08-10
00:04:50.040,00:04:55.080,so it only has to support about 38% of its weight just like it will have to do on Mars.,2019-08-10
00:04:55.080,00:04:57.200,"- And effectively it was a high-tech fishing reel,",2019-08-10
00:04:57.200,00:05:01.080,"so taking a brushed DC motor, a reaction torque sensor, and a pulley,",2019-08-10
00:05:01.080,00:05:03.240,mounting that a couple stories in the air,2019-08-10
00:05:03.240,00:05:06.360,and then attaching a fishing string to the top of the helicopter,2019-08-10
00:05:06.360,00:05:10.880,that would tug the necessary force required to offload the differences in gravity.,2019-08-10
00:05:10.880,00:05:12.120,- An actual fishing line?,2019-08-10
00:05:12.120,00:05:13.200,"- Yeah, real fishing line.",2019-08-10
00:05:13.200,00:05:14.600,"- But isn't that stretchy,",2019-08-10
00:05:14.600,00:05:18.880,like don't you want something that's perfectly rigid so as soon as you apply the torque it gets applied to the craft?,2019-08-10
00:05:18.880,00:05:23.960,"- Right right, and we did a lot of testing with different vendors to find out which fishing line had the best spring constant for us.",2019-08-10
00:05:24.680,00:05:26.920,- What does the helicopter sound like?,2019-08-10
00:05:26.920,00:05:32.040,"I imagined that in 1% of Earth's atmosphere, the helicopter would be pretty quiet.",2019-08-10
00:05:32.040,00:05:35.200,"- Yeah you're still at 1%, but it's still, real loud.",2019-08-10
00:05:35.200,00:05:35.760,- Really?,2019-08-10
00:05:35.760,00:05:37.520,- Yeah we have audio recordings of it too.,2019-08-10
00:05:37.520,00:05:42.460,"But it's it's, I would characterize it more like a 'baaaaaaaaah', something like that.",2019-08-10
00:05:43.120,00:05:46.440,(baaaaaaah),2019-08-10
00:05:46.560,00:05:51.640,"When gravity offload systems working and the chamber was pumped down, the helicopter thought it was on Mars.",2019-08-10
00:05:51.640,00:05:53.960,It felt like it was on Mars.,2019-08-10
00:05:53.960,00:05:57.840,- How do you actually steer this thing around and drive it?,2019-08-10
00:05:57.840,00:06:03.040,- So the way helicopters work is they have something called collective and cyclic.,2019-08-10
00:06:03.040,00:06:06.960,So what collectives do is they change the pitch on the blades uniformly.,2019-08-10
00:06:06.960,00:06:09.640,"So throughout the entire revolution you will move the collective,",2019-08-10
00:06:09.640,00:06:13.800,"the blades will change, you can change your angle of attack, you'll get more lift",2019-08-10
00:06:13.800,00:06:16.280,"so that's basically what you would provides you height control,",2019-08-10
00:06:16.280,00:06:20.040,"Right? You pitch more you go up, pitch less you come down.",2019-08-10
00:06:20.040,00:06:23.320,"But then, there's something called a cyclic on helicopters,",2019-08-10
00:06:23.320,00:06:29.040,"which basically what it does is it modulates the pitch as it goes around,",2019-08-10
00:06:29.040,00:06:34.200,"so it can pitch it a little bit more here, less here, so it kind of like modulates.",2019-08-10
00:06:34.200,00:06:37.640,"So what that does is it provides an asymmetric torque, right?",2019-08-10
00:06:37.640,00:06:40.040,When you're pitched up there you get that additional torque.,2019-08-10
00:06:40.040,00:06:46.960,"Now you get it, depending upon the stiffness the system you actually get it with that a gyroscopic lag that can happen afterwards.",2019-08-10
00:06:46.960,00:06:54.200,"So once you get an asymmetric torque, the vehicle wants to start pitching or rolling. Right?",2019-08-10
00:06:54.200,00:06:56.600,"So once it pitches and rolls,",2019-08-10
00:06:56.600,00:06:58.400,you're doing it stably.,2019-08-10
00:06:58.400,00:07:05.480,You are now pointed in a direction and your thrust vector now has a component that's horizontal in the direction that you pitched. Right?,2019-08-10
00:07:05.480,00:07:07.680,So then you start translating in that direction.,2019-08-10
00:07:07.680,00:07:12.240,- I've heard that initially someone tried to fly it with a joystick?,2019-08-10
00:07:12.240,00:07:13.600,- Yes. - Was it an early prototype?,2019-08-10
00:07:13.600,00:07:16.880,"- If you were sitting right there on Mars and you were trying to joystick it, what is it like?",2019-08-10
00:07:16.880,00:07:19.040,And it's almost unflyable.,2019-08-10
00:07:19.040,00:07:24.760,And the reason for that it's the aerodynamics of when you want to command a roll to the left,2019-08-10
00:07:24.760,00:07:28.640,because you see yourself starting to move to the right and you start commanding a roll to the left.,2019-08-10
00:07:28.640,00:07:30.160,There's a delay aspect.,2019-08-10
00:07:30.160,00:07:34.840,So that that delay effect makes it very very difficult for a human to try and pilot it.,2019-08-10
00:07:34.840,00:07:37.240,- You can't fly this from Earth...,2019-08-10
00:07:37.240,00:07:42.760,"- because of the twenty-minute kind of time delay, so you have to really send sequences.",2019-08-10
00:07:42.760,00:07:45.200,"- So essentially you're gonna push a button,",2019-08-10
00:07:45.200,00:07:49.280,and like 20 minutes later it'll take off and do its thing and then you will find out.,2019-08-10
00:07:49.280,00:07:51.200,"- The way this flies autonomously,",2019-08-10
00:07:51.200,00:08:00.560,"it has onboard gyros, onboard accelerometers and onboard camera,  an altimeter and an inclinometer;",2019-08-10
00:08:00.560,00:08:02.640,"and so using that sensor suite,",2019-08-10
00:08:02.640,00:08:10.680,"real-time measurement, you know against terrain and of course the gyros and the accelerometers sensing onboard",2019-08-10
00:08:10.680,00:08:19.200,the real-time estimation of the state of the vehicle is made continuously again at hundreds of Hertz,2019-08-10
00:08:19.200,00:08:23.400,"and then that's fed into the closed-loop control algorithm,",2019-08-10
00:08:23.400,00:08:25.440,that takes the estimated state,2019-08-10
00:08:25.440,00:08:30.720,"and then generates the correction that's needed at the blade level,",2019-08-10
00:08:30.720,00:08:33.000,and then the blades are continuously being controlled.,2019-08-10
00:08:33.000,00:08:38.400,"So when you see video tapes of our ""successful flights"", right!",2019-08-10
00:08:38.400,00:08:44.520,"And the vehicle looks dead calm, it's coming up, and hovering, and going laterally, coming back;",2019-08-10
00:08:45.280,00:08:51.240,"you know the machines are working very very fast and very very hard it just looks very calm, but yes",2019-08-10
00:08:51.240,00:08:53.840,so the the blades are being continuously controlled.,2019-08-10
00:08:53.840,00:08:55.280,- That is amazing.,2019-08-10
00:08:55.280,00:08:57.880,How will it handle a gentle breeze?,2019-08-10
00:08:57.880,00:09:01.020,- A lot of the movies depict - Dust storms?,2019-08-10
00:09:01.020,00:09:03.840,- The big dust storms as being very aggressive on Mars.,2019-08-10
00:09:03.840,00:09:10.000,"The truth of the matter is that with 1% Earth's atmosphere, there is very little matter actually hitting you.",2019-08-10
00:09:10.000,00:09:12.240,"- I mean, you're using that to lift yourself.",2019-08-10
00:09:12.240,00:09:15.160,"- Exactly, so there's enough to lift, right?",2019-08-10
00:09:15.160,00:09:18.840,But we also need to spend at 2200 rpms to be in the ballpark of lifting ourselves.,2019-08-10
00:09:18.840,00:09:22.080,- We built our own wind tunnel that we put inside this 25 foot chamber.,2019-08-10
00:09:22.080,00:09:23.760,"How many fans was it, Teddy?",2019-08-10
00:09:23.760,00:09:25.800,960 computer fans.,2019-08-10
00:09:25.800,00:09:28.720,"So, but it does sound like a like a jet engine taking off.",2019-08-10
00:09:28.720,00:09:34.600,"So we built a fan wall array, it's called an open cross-section wind tunnel, where you don't need the walls,",2019-08-10
00:09:34.600,00:09:39.960,"just the fact of having an array of fans we are very confident of being able to go at 11 meters per second,",2019-08-10
00:09:39.960,00:09:41.200,in this vehicle.,2019-08-10
00:09:41.200,00:09:45.400,"if I had known that somewhere along the way I'd be building a wind tunnel to do this,",2019-08-10
00:09:45.400,00:09:48.160,"I would have probably not taken the job on, right?",2019-08-10
00:09:48.160,00:09:49.840,- How long does it take to recharge?,2019-08-10
00:09:49.840,00:09:51.640,We recharge the whole day.,2019-08-10
00:09:51.640,00:09:53.720,"So, the whole day at Mars.",2019-08-10
00:09:53.720,00:09:57.920,- Right. But does that mean that you could do one flight a day kind of thing? In theory?,2019-08-10
00:09:57.920,00:10:00.160,"- In theory, yes, by design it can.",2019-08-10
00:10:00.160,00:10:02.320,- What is the size of the battery?,2019-08-10
00:10:02.320,00:10:05.320,- Between 35 and 40 watt hours total.,2019-08-10
00:10:05.320,00:10:09.080,- That's equivalent to just three smartphone batteries.,2019-08-10
00:10:09.080,00:10:13.280,And get this -- most of that energy isn't even used for flying.,2019-08-10
00:10:13.280,00:10:18.520,- It has to survive temperatures as low as about minus 80 to minus hundred degrees C at night.,2019-08-10
00:10:18.520,00:10:25.000,So we keep the batteries warm and we surround the batteries with our electronics board so the electronic boards also stay warm.,2019-08-10
00:10:25.000,00:10:30.240,We take approximately two-thirds of energy just keeping things warm and warming things up to operate.,2019-08-10
00:10:30.240,00:10:32.480,Only one-third of the energy is available for flight.,2019-08-10
00:10:32.480,00:10:35.160,- Do you have insulation on there to keep it warm?,2019-08-10
00:10:35.160,00:10:40.480,"- Yes. When you look at that helicopter, right, you have the solar panel on top with antenna,",2019-08-10
00:10:40.480,00:10:42.240,"and then next is the rotor system,",2019-08-10
00:10:42.240,00:10:46.000,"and then bottom what you see this cube, is what we call the fuselage,",2019-08-10
00:10:46.000,00:10:48.440,you are seeing it now actually uncovered,2019-08-10
00:10:48.440,00:10:54.400,because you're seeing the last day of final. We're recovering for delivery to be integrated onto the rover.,2019-08-10
00:10:54.400,00:10:56.560,okay so usually you won't be seeing that.,2019-08-10
00:10:56.560,00:11:00.280,"So the center of the cube is the ring of batteries, okay.",2019-08-10
00:11:00.280,00:11:04.920,There is space between the battery and the circuit boards that you are seeing.,2019-08-10
00:11:04.920,00:11:09.520,"And then there will be a shell that we put on called the fuselage shell,",2019-08-10
00:11:09.520,00:11:14.760,"and that will close like CO2, the gas, around.",2019-08-10
00:11:14.760,00:11:20.240,And so the enclosure itself we're using the CO2 gas as the insulation material,2019-08-10
00:11:20.240,00:11:22.240,- Oh wow! No aerogel?,2019-08-10
00:11:22.240,00:11:25.720,"- No aerogel. We did it consider it. It was in the game,",2019-08-10
00:11:25.720,00:11:28.640,"it was in the consideration in the beginning,",2019-08-10
00:11:28.640,00:11:37.960,and it turns out that just the CO2 as insulator itself was sufficient for us to close our thermal model.,2019-08-10
00:11:37.960,00:11:38.320,- Right.,2019-08-10
00:11:38.320,00:11:42.320,- And so guess why we wouldn't want to use aerogel if we have a choice.,2019-08-10
00:11:42.320,00:11:43.080,- Weight.,2019-08-10
00:11:43.080,00:11:45.320,"- Yep, there you go. Welcome to our team",2019-08-10
00:11:45.320,00:11:49.240,"- Now before the helicopter can experience the frigid conditions on Mars,",2019-08-10
00:11:49.240,00:11:51.040,first it has to get there.,2019-08-10
00:11:51.040,00:11:55.880,"And that's a reminder that not only is this an aircraft, it's also a spacecraft.",2019-08-10
00:11:55.880,00:11:57.380,- It has to survive launch.,2019-08-10
00:11:57.380,00:12:02.840,"It has to survive launch loads which, you know, easily exceed about 80G",2019-08-10
00:12:02.840,00:12:05.760,"You know, because of the vibration. Vibrational loads are 80G.",2019-08-10
00:12:05.760,00:12:10.440,"- Yeah. Then it has to survive the seven-month trip, complete with radiation.",2019-08-10
00:12:10.440,00:12:17.240,And finally after pulling nine Gs on entry into the Martian atmosphere the helicopter needs to be deployed.,2019-08-10
00:12:17.240,00:12:22.680,"This is gonna be on the rover, before you take off, does the rover like pick you up and put you down somewhere?",2019-08-10
00:12:22.680,00:12:26.800,- We're gonna be stowed underneath the rover on the belly pan on our side.,2019-08-10
00:12:26.800,00:12:32.560,And there's gonna be several several sequences of firings of explosive devices,2019-08-10
00:12:32.560,00:12:35.819,to actually rotate us right side up and then drop us on the surface.,2019-08-10
00:12:35.819,00:12:40.920,"- For example the very last thing the rover does is it's got us by this bolt, it's holding us about this high,",2019-08-10
00:12:40.920,00:12:42.720,"and then it goes has to drop us, right?",2019-08-10
00:12:42.720,00:12:43.040,- Yeah.,2019-08-10
00:12:43.040,00:12:46.000,"- So how do you undo a bolt on, on a spacecraft?",2019-08-10
00:12:46.000,00:12:46.600,- You blow it up.,2019-08-10
00:12:46.600,00:12:51.120,- You blow it up. Basically it's materials you know undergoes a phase transition,2019-08-10
00:12:51.120,00:12:55.240,"which suddenly increases the, the stress in the metal part of the thing",2019-08-10
00:12:55.240,00:12:58.840,and makes the bolt break. It's called a frangibolt.,2019-08-10
00:12:58.840,00:13:01.240,"- Then once we're on the surface, the rover drives over us,",2019-08-10
00:13:01.240,00:13:03.160,"it gets about 100 meters away,",2019-08-10
00:13:03.160,00:13:07.120,"and then we have about a two-hour counter internally,",2019-08-10
00:13:07.120,00:13:11.080,"where we'll wake up after 2 hours, wait to hear some RF transmissions,",2019-08-10
00:13:11.080,00:13:13.920,and if we do get that link with the rover then great.,2019-08-10
00:13:13.920,00:13:17.720,- Our base station on the rover would issue the fly now command.,2019-08-10
00:13:17.720,00:13:20.040,"First flight will probably be a mutual selfie, you would think..",2019-08-10
00:13:21.040,00:13:23.440,This is after all the selfie age.,2019-08-10
00:13:24.640,00:13:26.320,- I like that as the goal of the first flight.,2019-08-10
00:13:26.320,00:13:29.920,"- Yes it is. In fact, it is good to know the best time to fly this",2019-08-10
00:13:29.920,00:13:32.880,is at 11 o'clock in the morning local time on Mars.,2019-08-10
00:13:32.880,00:13:35.680,"and that the reason for that is, we would have come out of the night,",2019-08-10
00:13:35.680,00:13:40.240,where we would have spent a lot of battery power trying to you know stay warm.,2019-08-10
00:13:40.240,00:13:44.920,"By 11 o'clock, the state of the charge would have gotten to the point where you could fly",2019-08-10
00:13:44.920,00:13:49.600,"without risking a brownout on the battery and then, you know, dropping the whole craft to the ground.",2019-08-10
00:13:49.600,00:13:53.880,"Also 11 o'clock is where the Sun would have warmed up things,",2019-08-10
00:13:53.880,00:13:56.520,so we don't quite have to heat up as much.,2019-08-10
00:13:56.520,00:14:02.120,"And also it's not late afternoon where because of the warmth, the density has begun to drop,",2019-08-10
00:14:02.120,00:14:04.640,"okay, and the winds have begun to pick up.",2019-08-10
00:14:04.640,00:14:09.640,"Now, what we will investigate is after we get the first couple of flights under our belt,",2019-08-10
00:14:09.640,00:14:13.920,I'm sure we will try to fly in the afternoon and you know do more exploratory things.,2019-08-10
00:14:13.920,00:14:16.240,But the most conservative thing we can do,2019-08-10
00:14:16.240,00:14:18.840,is to sort of pick a mid-morning flight.,2019-08-10
00:14:18.840,00:14:21.440,- So what is the purpose of this mission?,2019-08-10
00:14:21.440,00:14:25.520,The Mars helicopter is first and foremost a technology demonstration,2019-08-10
00:14:25.520,00:14:29.200,to prove that we can fly on another planet.,2019-08-10
00:14:29.200,00:14:35.520,"The helicopter can take color photos and videos, but its purpose is not to make scientific discoveries.",2019-08-10
00:14:35.520,00:14:41.200,Instead it is to help engineers figure out how to design and build aircraft for future missions.,2019-08-10
00:14:41.200,00:14:47.600,"- You can imagine something that's about 30 kilograms carrying you know a 2 kilogram science payload, doing exploration,",2019-08-10
00:14:47.600,00:14:53.200,"acting like a scout, like a small vehicle, like this, scouting ahead for some future rover;",2019-08-10
00:14:53.200,00:15:01.840,or it could be a gadget that goes and picks up some kind of samples and brings it back to a central lander for more sophisticated analysis;,2019-08-10
00:15:01.840,00:15:05.120,"or it could be a completely standalone craft, and maybe more than one",2019-08-10
00:15:05.120,00:15:10.280,that are exploring places where humans and rovers can't get to easily:,2019-08-10
00:15:11.360,00:15:13.560,"polar ice caps, you know",2019-08-10
00:15:13.560,00:15:15.440,sides of cliffs and so forth.,2019-08-10
00:15:15.440,00:15:21.080,So the real emphasis here is to try to get back all the engineering data so that it can inform that future design.,2019-08-10
00:15:21.080,00:15:25.640,- Flying on other planets will provide a new dimension in space exploration.,2019-08-10
00:15:25.640,00:15:30.600,An aircraft is faster and capable of covering more ground than a rover,2019-08-10
00:15:30.600,00:15:35.240,and it can provide higher resolution imagery than an orbiting spacecraft.,2019-08-10
00:15:35.240,00:15:42.760,"So maybe one day, aircrafts will be the companions of future rovers or even astronauts exploring other worlds.",2019-08-10
