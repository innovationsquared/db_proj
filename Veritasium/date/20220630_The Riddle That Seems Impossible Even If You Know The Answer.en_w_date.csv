00:00:00.060,00:00:03.420,"There is a riddle that is so counterintuitive,",2022-06-30
00:00:03.420,00:00:06.210,it still seems wrong even if you know the answer.,2022-06-30
00:00:06.210,00:00:08.700,- You'd think it's an almost impossible number.,2022-06-30
00:00:08.700,00:00:11.010,- I feel like you probably hit me with some truth bomb.,2022-06-30
00:00:11.010,00:00:13.080,"- I mean, if you're trying to create controversy",2022-06-30
00:00:13.080,00:00:14.640,"and you're trying to confuse people,",2022-06-30
00:00:14.640,00:00:15.801,you're gonna succeed.,2022-06-30
00:00:15.801,00:00:17.370,(both laughs),2022-06-30
00:00:17.370,00:00:19.410,"- There are a bunch of YouTube videos about it,",2022-06-30
00:00:19.410,00:00:23.310,but I find all of them either incorrect or incomplete.,2022-06-30
00:00:23.310,00:00:25.890,"So in this video, I'm going to dive deeper",2022-06-30
00:00:25.890,00:00:27.600,and explain it fully.,2022-06-30
00:00:27.600,00:00:29.313,Here is the setup.,2022-06-30
00:00:33.357,00:00:35.520,(suspenseful music),2022-06-30
00:00:35.520,00:00:39.390,Say there are 100 prisoners numbered 1 to 100.,2022-06-30
00:00:39.390,00:00:41.670,Slips of paper containing each of their numbers,2022-06-30
00:00:41.670,00:00:46.290,are randomly placed in 100 boxes in a sealed room.,2022-06-30
00:00:46.290,00:00:49.290,"One at a time, each prisoner is allowed to enter the room",2022-06-30
00:00:49.290,00:00:52.260,"and open any 50 of the 100 boxes,",2022-06-30
00:00:52.260,00:00:54.000,searching for their number.,2022-06-30
00:00:54.000,00:00:56.190,"And afterwards, they must leave the room",2022-06-30
00:00:56.190,00:00:57.810,"exactly as they found it,",2022-06-30
00:00:57.810,00:00:59.820,and they can't communicate in any way,2022-06-30
00:00:59.820,00:01:01.770,with the other prisoners.,2022-06-30
00:01:01.770,00:01:04.710,If all 100 prisoners find their own number,2022-06-30
00:01:04.710,00:01:06.180,"during their turn in the room,",2022-06-30
00:01:06.180,00:01:08.400,they will all be freed.,2022-06-30
00:01:08.400,00:01:11.220,"But if even one of them fails to find their number,",2022-06-30
00:01:11.220,00:01:13.770,they will all be executed.,2022-06-30
00:01:13.770,00:01:16.470,The prisoners are allowed to strategize,2022-06-30
00:01:16.470,00:01:19.020,before any of them goes into the room.,2022-06-30
00:01:19.020,00:01:22.020,So what is their best strategy?,2022-06-30
00:01:22.020,00:01:24.660,"If they each search for their own number randomly,",2022-06-30
00:01:24.660,00:01:27.960,then each prisoner has a 50% chance of finding it.,2022-06-30
00:01:27.960,00:01:31.470,So the probability that all 100 prisoners find their numbers,2022-06-30
00:01:31.470,00:01:35.670,is 1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2 a hundred times,2022-06-30
00:01:35.670,00:01:38.250,or 1/2 to the power of 100.,2022-06-30
00:01:38.250,00:01:41.480,"This is equal to 0.00000000 30 zeros,",2022-06-30
00:01:44.310,00:01:46.290,and then an eight.,2022-06-30
00:01:46.290,00:01:48.930,"To put this probability into perspective,",2022-06-30
00:01:48.930,00:01:51.450,two people have a better chance of picking out,2022-06-30
00:01:51.450,00:01:54.180,the same grain of sand from all,2022-06-30
00:01:54.180,00:01:56.910,the beaches and deserts on earth,2022-06-30
00:01:56.910,00:01:59.073,than by escaping this way.,2022-06-30
00:01:59.940,00:02:02.910,"But what have I told you that with the right strategy,",2022-06-30
00:02:02.910,00:02:06.840,there's a way to raise their chances to nearly one in three.,2022-06-30
00:02:06.840,00:02:08.910,It improves their odds of a random chance,2022-06-30
00:02:08.910,00:02:12.000,by nearly 30 orders of magnitude.,2022-06-30
00:02:12.000,00:02:14.490,That's like taking a millimeter and scaling it up,2022-06-30
00:02:14.490,00:02:17.133,to the diameter of the observable universe.,2022-06-30
00:02:19.830,00:02:23.010,- But they can only coordinate this strategy beforehand.,2022-06-30
00:02:23.010,00:02:23.843,- Correct?,2022-06-30
00:02:23.843,00:02:25.050,- Is this true?,2022-06-30
00:02:25.050,00:02:25.953,- Yes.,2022-06-30
00:02:27.720,00:02:28.553,- Teach me.,2022-06-30
00:02:29.700,00:02:32.070,- This is not a trick question.,2022-06-30
00:02:32.070,00:02:35.700,The solution just involves an incredible feature of math.,2022-06-30
00:02:35.700,00:02:38.460,So what is this mathematical strategy?,2022-06-30
00:02:38.460,00:02:40.230,"Well, if you don't already know the answer,",2022-06-30
00:02:40.230,00:02:43.623,feel free to pause the video here and try it for yourself.,2022-06-30
00:02:46.020,00:02:48.360,"And if you don't come up with it, don't worry,",2022-06-30
00:02:48.360,00:02:49.320,you're in good company.,2022-06-30
00:02:49.320,00:02:51.330,"Even the person who came up with this riddle,",2022-06-30
00:02:51.330,00:02:53.280,"computer scientist Peter Bro Miltersen,",2022-06-30
00:02:53.280,00:02:54.870,he didn't even think of this strategy,2022-06-30
00:02:54.870,00:02:57.330,until a colleague pointed it out.,2022-06-30
00:02:57.330,00:03:00.060,"Miltersen, ultimately published this problem in a paper",2022-06-30
00:03:00.060,00:03:02.370,where he generously left the solution,2022-06-30
00:03:02.370,00:03:04.353,as an exercise for the reader.,2022-06-30
00:03:05.790,00:03:08.880,So here is the solution.,2022-06-30
00:03:08.880,00:03:11.520,"Pretend you are one of the prisoners,",2022-06-30
00:03:11.520,00:03:13.170,"when you go into the room,",2022-06-30
00:03:13.170,00:03:16.170,"open the box with your number on it,",2022-06-30
00:03:16.170,00:03:19.170,"the number on the slip inside probably won't be yours,",2022-06-30
00:03:19.170,00:03:20.580,but that's okay.,2022-06-30
00:03:20.580,00:03:23.070,Go to the box with that number on it.,2022-06-30
00:03:23.070,00:03:24.360,"look at the number inside,",2022-06-30
00:03:24.360,00:03:27.810,"then go to the box with that number on it, and so on.",2022-06-30
00:03:27.810,00:03:31.440,Keep doing this until you find the slip with your number.,2022-06-30
00:03:31.440,00:03:32.790,"If you find your number,",2022-06-30
00:03:32.790,00:03:34.140,that essentially tells you,2022-06-30
00:03:34.140,00:03:36.390,to go back to the box where you started.,2022-06-30
00:03:36.390,00:03:39.990,It closes the loop of numbers you've been following.,2022-06-30
00:03:39.990,00:03:42.630,"But if you've found your number, then you're done.",2022-06-30
00:03:42.630,00:03:45.120,You can stop and leave the room.,2022-06-30
00:03:45.120,00:03:48.690,This simple strategy gives over a 30% chance,2022-06-30
00:03:48.690,00:03:51.660,that all the prisoners will find their number.,2022-06-30
00:03:51.660,00:03:53.730,- The entire pool has a 30...,2022-06-30
00:03:53.730,00:03:56.823,- Everyone can find their number 31% of the time.,2022-06-30
00:03:58.200,00:03:59.033,- What?,2022-06-30
00:04:00.630,00:04:02.133,- But how does it work?,2022-06-30
00:04:03.300,00:04:05.760,The first thing to notice is that all boxes,2022-06-30
00:04:05.760,00:04:07.653,become part of a closed loop.,2022-06-30
00:04:08.880,00:04:10.200,The simplest loop would be,2022-06-30
00:04:10.200,00:04:12.240,a box that contains its own number.,2022-06-30
00:04:12.240,00:04:14.730,"If you're prisoner number one and you go to box one,",2022-06-30
00:04:14.730,00:04:17.370,"it contains slip one, then you're done.",2022-06-30
00:04:17.370,00:04:20.580,"Your number was part of a loop of one,",2022-06-30
00:04:20.580,00:04:22.770,but you could also have a loop of two.,2022-06-30
00:04:22.770,00:04:24.810,Say box one points to box seven,2022-06-30
00:04:24.810,00:04:27.870,and box seven points back to box one.,2022-06-30
00:04:27.870,00:04:32.670,"Or you could have a loop of three, or four, or five,",2022-06-30
00:04:32.670,00:04:36.000,or any length all the way up to 100.,2022-06-30
00:04:36.000,00:04:37.800,The longest loop you could have would connect,2022-06-30
00:04:37.800,00:04:40.440,all the numbers in a single loop.,2022-06-30
00:04:40.440,00:04:43.110,"But more generally, any random arrangement",2022-06-30
00:04:43.110,00:04:44.520,of the slips in these boxes,2022-06-30
00:04:44.520,00:04:47.310,will result in a mixture of some shorter,2022-06-30
00:04:47.310,00:04:49.113,and some longer loops.,2022-06-30
00:04:50.220,00:04:52.740,"When you start with a box labeled with your number,",2022-06-30
00:04:52.740,00:04:54.930,you are guaranteed to be on the loop,2022-06-30
00:04:54.930,00:04:56.670,that includes your slip.,2022-06-30
00:04:56.670,00:04:58.590,So the thing that determines whether or not,2022-06-30
00:04:58.590,00:05:01.890,you find your slip is the length of the loop.,2022-06-30
00:05:01.890,00:05:04.440,"If your number is part of a loop that is shorter than 50,",2022-06-30
00:05:04.440,00:05:07.020,then you will definitely find your slip.,2022-06-30
00:05:07.020,00:05:10.050,"But if your number is part of a loop that is 51 or longer,",2022-06-30
00:05:10.050,00:05:11.520,you are in trouble.,2022-06-30
00:05:11.520,00:05:13.740,You won't find it before you've exhausted,2022-06-30
00:05:13.740,00:05:15.993,the 50 boxes you're allowed to search.,2022-06-30
00:05:17.280,00:05:19.710,"When you open the box labeled with your number,",2022-06-30
00:05:19.710,00:05:21.120,you are in fact starting,2022-06-30
00:05:21.120,00:05:23.970,at the farthest point on the loop from your slip.,2022-06-30
00:05:23.970,00:05:27.990,"You wanna know where is the slip that points to this box,",2022-06-30
00:05:27.990,00:05:30.450,"but to find it, you have to follow the loop of numbers",2022-06-30
00:05:30.450,00:05:32.820,all the way around to the end.,2022-06-30
00:05:32.820,00:05:35.520,That means if the prisoners follow this strategy,2022-06-30
00:05:35.520,00:05:37.440,"and the longest loop is 51,",2022-06-30
00:05:37.440,00:05:39.390,not just one or two prisoners,2022-06-30
00:05:39.390,00:05:40.890,"will fail to find their number,",2022-06-30
00:05:40.890,00:05:44.370,but all 51 on this loop won't make it.,2022-06-30
00:05:44.370,00:05:47.580,"They make it to the box just before the box with their slip,",2022-06-30
00:05:47.580,00:05:49.623,but they have to stop searching there.,2022-06-30
00:05:53.225,00:05:55.725,(both laughs),2022-06-30
00:05:57.180,00:06:00.390,So the probability that all of the prisoners succeed,2022-06-30
00:06:00.390,00:06:02.640,is just the probability that a random arrangement,2022-06-30
00:06:02.640,00:06:06.960,of a hundred numbers contains no loops longer than 50.,2022-06-30
00:06:06.960,00:06:09.180,Now I promised that this probability would come out,2022-06-30
00:06:09.180,00:06:10.710,"to around one in three,",2022-06-30
00:06:10.710,00:06:13.080,but how do we calculate it?,2022-06-30
00:06:13.080,00:06:16.080,"Well, imagine writing down all the different ways",2022-06-30
00:06:16.080,00:06:19.920,that you could connect 100 boxes to form a loop,2022-06-30
00:06:19.920,00:06:21.000,of length 100.,2022-06-30
00:06:21.000,00:06:24.180,"So you could have box one points to box two,",2022-06-30
00:06:24.180,00:06:28.110,"box two points to box three to box four, and so on,",2022-06-30
00:06:28.110,00:06:29.817,"all the way to 100,",2022-06-30
00:06:29.817,00:06:33.570,"and then box 100 would point back to box one,",2022-06-30
00:06:33.570,00:06:36.150,or you could have something random.,2022-06-30
00:06:36.150,00:06:40.620,"Box five points to box 99 to box 17 and so on,",2022-06-30
00:06:40.620,00:06:42.720,"and let's pick the last one,",2022-06-30
00:06:42.720,00:06:43.953,is 63.,2022-06-30
00:06:45.060,00:06:47.700,And box 63 points back to box five.,2022-06-30
00:06:47.700,00:06:51.600,So how many different arrangements of these a hundred boxes,2022-06-30
00:06:51.600,00:06:54.390,or permutations could you have?,2022-06-30
00:06:54.390,00:06:56.010,"Well, for the first box,",2022-06-30
00:06:56.010,00:06:59.430,I have 100 different boxes that I could choose from.,2022-06-30
00:06:59.430,00:07:02.610,"The second box, because I've already used one,",2022-06-30
00:07:02.610,00:07:05.100,"I can only pick from 99 boxes,",2022-06-30
00:07:05.100,00:07:08.910,"and the next one, I can pick from 98 boxes, and so on,",2022-06-30
00:07:08.910,00:07:10.800,down to the very last box.,2022-06-30
00:07:10.800,00:07:11.970,I don't really have a choice.,2022-06-30
00:07:11.970,00:07:16.200,There's only one box left I could put in the last position.,2022-06-30
00:07:16.200,00:07:18.270,So the total number of different permutations,2022-06-30
00:07:18.270,00:07:22.770,"would be 100 times 99, times 98, times 97,",2022-06-30
00:07:22.770,00:07:23.970,all the way down to one.,2022-06-30
00:07:23.970,00:07:27.690,That is just 100 factorial.,2022-06-30
00:07:27.690,00:07:31.440,There are 100 factorial different ways,2022-06-30
00:07:31.440,00:07:35.400,that you could create a loop of a hundred boxes.,2022-06-30
00:07:35.400,00:07:37.980,But what we can't forget,2022-06-30
00:07:37.980,00:07:40.890,is that these are not just lines of numbers.,2022-06-30
00:07:40.890,00:07:42.870,They are loops.,2022-06-30
00:07:42.870,00:07:46.590,So some of these lines that look different,2022-06-30
00:07:46.590,00:07:48.603,are actually the same loop.,2022-06-30
00:07:50.820,00:07:53.850,"For example, two, three, four, five, and so on",2022-06-30
00:07:53.850,00:07:55.500,up to 100 and then 1,2022-06-30
00:07:55.500,00:07:59.100,"is the same thing as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to 100.",2022-06-30
00:07:59.100,00:08:02.370,You can rearrange the way you write these numbers,2022-06-30
00:08:02.370,00:08:05.250,"a hundred different ways,",2022-06-30
00:08:05.250,00:08:08.640,but they all represent the same loop.,2022-06-30
00:08:08.640,00:08:12.840,So the total number of unique loops of length 100,2022-06-30
00:08:12.840,00:08:16.530,is 100 factorial divided by 100.,2022-06-30
00:08:16.530,00:08:20.190,So what is the probability that any,2022-06-30
00:08:20.190,00:08:22.680,random arrangement of 100 boxes,2022-06-30
00:08:22.680,00:08:24.990,will contain a loop of length 100?,2022-06-30
00:08:24.990,00:08:28.110,"Well, it's just equal to the number of unique such loops",2022-06-30

00:08:39.840,00:08:43.290,So the answer is 1 over 100.,2022-06-30
00:08:43.290,00:08:46.920,So there is a 1% chance that a random arrangement of slips,2022-06-30
00:08:46.920,00:08:49.350,"results in a loop of length 100,",2022-06-30
00:08:49.350,00:08:51.600,and this is a general result.,2022-06-30
00:08:51.600,00:08:54.570,The probability that you get a loop of length 99,2022-06-30
00:08:54.570,00:08:56.067,is 1 over 99.,2022-06-30

00:09:02.100,00:09:06.270,So the probability that there is a loop longer than 50,2022-06-30
00:09:06.270,00:09:07.900,is 1 over 51 plus 1 over 52,2022-06-30

00:11:01.170,00:11:02.970,how do you know that if you start,2022-06-30
00:11:02.970,00:11:04.860,with a box with your number on it,2022-06-30

00:11:19.800,00:11:23.070,So the slip and box with the same number,2022-06-30
00:11:23.070,00:11:25.020,essentially form a unit.,2022-06-30

00:11:39.960,00:11:42.090,that we can end up with a dead end.,2022-06-30
00:11:42.090,00:11:44.400,It's not like you can just get to a box and then stop,2022-06-30
00:11:44.400,00:11:46.770,because every box contains a slip,2022-06-30

00:12:36.900,00:12:40.620,by swapping the contents of just two boxes.,2022-06-30
00:12:40.620,00:12:43.410,That's because there can be at most one loop,2022-06-30
00:12:43.410,00:12:45.570,"that is longer than 50,",2022-06-30
00:12:45.570,00:12:47.940,and you can break it in half,2022-06-30
00:12:47.940,00:12:51.600,just by swapping the contents of two boxes.,2022-06-30
00:12:51.600,00:12:53.010,And now I have two separate loops,2022-06-30

00:13:02.970,00:13:04.830,"Well, then they could put the numbers in boxes",2022-06-30
00:13:04.830,00:13:08.370,to ensure they formed a loop longer than 50.,2022-06-30

00:15:11.370,00:15:14.550,it becomes a better and better approximation.,2022-06-30
00:15:14.550,00:15:16.800,"So to find the probability of failure,",2022-06-30
00:15:16.800,00:15:19.560,we can just take the integral of one over X,2022-06-30
00:15:19.560,00:15:21.240,from n to 2n.,2022-06-30
00:15:21.240,00:15:25.620,And we find that it's equal to the natural logarithm of two.,2022-06-30
00:15:25.620,00:15:27.600,This gives a probability of success,2022-06-30
00:15:27.600,00:15:29.970,"of one minus the natural log of two,",2022-06-30
00:15:29.970,00:15:33.780,which is about 30.7%.,2022-06-30
00:15:33.780,00:15:34.800,The bottom line is,2022-06-30
00:15:34.800,00:15:37.110,"that no matter how many prisoners you have,",2022-06-30
00:15:37.110,00:15:39.810,you'll always end up with above a 30% chance,2022-06-30
00:15:39.810,00:15:41.610,of escaping using this strategy.,2022-06-30
00:15:41.610,00:15:43.470,And that feels really wrong.,2022-06-30
00:15:43.470,00:15:45.270,"I mean, at first it seemed essentially impossible",2022-06-30
00:15:45.270,00:15:47.670,for all 100 prisoners to find their numbers.,2022-06-30
00:15:47.670,00:15:49.020,But now we're seeing that you could have,2022-06-30
00:15:49.020,00:15:50.220,"a hundred, a million,",2022-06-30
00:15:50.220,00:15:53.190,or any arbitrarily large number of prisoners,2022-06-30
00:15:53.190,00:15:56.880,with at least a 30% chance that they all find their numbers.,2022-06-30
00:15:56.880,00:15:58.530,The beauty of the loop strategy,2022-06-30
00:15:58.530,00:16:01.440,"is linking everyone's outcomes together,",2022-06-30
00:16:01.440,00:16:03.090,instead of each prisoner walking in,2022-06-30
00:16:03.090,00:16:05.010,with their own 50-50 shot.,2022-06-30
00:16:05.010,00:16:07.230,Following the same loops means that they have,2022-06-30
00:16:07.230,00:16:09.480,the exact same chance of finding their number,2022-06-30
00:16:09.480,00:16:11.280,as everyone else in their loop.,2022-06-30
