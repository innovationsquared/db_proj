00:00:01.340,00:00:02.380,[High-pitched CRT TV noise],2019-03-29
00:00:02.560,00:00:05.320,Film is a very straightforward technology.,2019-03-29
00:00:05.320,00:00:08.200,"It just involves taking a two-dimensional image,",2019-03-29
00:00:08.200,00:00:12.520,"and focusing it on to a two-dimensional piece of film, and there you have a photo.",2019-03-29
00:00:12.520,00:00:16.680,"But video, and by that, I mean moving electronic images,",2019-03-29
00:00:16.680,00:00:22.280,has a very different history with a lot of changes that have really transformed the way it works.,2019-03-29
00:00:22.280,00:00:25.040,"This video was sponsored by B&amp;H Photo,",2019-03-29
00:00:25.040,00:00:29.120,which is kind of fitting because that's where I get a lot of my gear to make these videos.,2019-03-29
00:00:29.120,00:00:33.240,"So I'll tell you more about them later, but now it's off to San Francisco.",2019-03-29
00:00:38.080,00:00:43.240,I'm going to meet with a guy who knows a lot about old video gear and he's got some he's gonna show me.,2019-03-29
00:00:44.080,00:00:45.680,"- Richard, nice to meet you.",2019-03-29
00:00:45.680,00:00:49.600,- Nice to meet you Derek. Come on in. Welcome to LabGuy's World.,2019-03-29
00:00:49.620,00:00:52.340,- [Laughs.] That's a cool spot you got here.,2019-03-29
00:00:52.360,00:00:53.320,- Thank you.,2019-03-29
00:00:53.320,00:00:58.240,- The fundamental problem of video is taking this two-dimensional light image,2019-03-29
00:00:58.240,00:01:01.960,and turning it into a one-dimensional electrical signal.,2019-03-29
00:01:01.960,00:01:04.080,So how do you do that?,2019-03-29
00:01:04.080,00:01:08.520,"Well, the solution actually comes from the first ever fax machine,",2019-03-29
00:01:08.520,00:01:13.160,"which believe it or not, was invented in 1843 by Alexander Bain.",2019-03-29
00:01:13.160,00:01:15.360,Now he was a clock maker.,2019-03-29
00:01:15.360,00:01:20.520,"His invention involved a transmitter and receiver which each had a pendulum,",2019-03-29
00:01:20.520,00:01:22.920,and those pendulums were synchronized.,2019-03-29
00:01:22.920,00:01:27.440,"So what would happen is, at the transmitter, there would be a metal sheet",2019-03-29
00:01:27.440,00:01:32.000,on which something was written or drawn using a non-conducting ink.,2019-03-29
00:01:32.000,00:01:34.520,"- So a finger at the transmitter,",2019-03-29
00:01:34.520,00:01:39.120,"an electric finger, would stroke over the paper and wherever there was iron, it would conduct,",2019-03-29
00:01:39.120,00:01:42.040,"and that conducting signal was sent to the other end,",2019-03-29
00:01:42.040,00:01:47.160,"which was applied to paper with a chemical that would turn dark when electricity flowed through it,",2019-03-29
00:01:47.160,00:01:52.240,and it would reproduce a very accurate image of the handwritten note you just made.,2019-03-29
00:01:52.240,00:01:56.200,"- Now Alexander Bain only ever transmitted static images,",2019-03-29
00:01:56.200,00:02:00.560,"but some people have called him the real father of television,",2019-03-29
00:02:00.560,00:02:02.120,because he invented scanning.,2019-03-29
00:02:02.120,00:02:06.000,"This idea of moving back and forth across an image,",2019-03-29
00:02:06.000,00:02:08.800,breaking it down into lines.,2019-03-29
00:02:08.800,00:02:11.480,"But if you really want to get moving images,",2019-03-29
00:02:11.480,00:02:14.120,"well, you need to be able to scan much faster.",2019-03-29
00:02:14.120,00:02:21.400,"So we have to jump forward to 1884, and a 23-year-old German University student named Paul Nipkow.",2019-03-29
00:02:21.400,00:02:24.600,"He patented what is called the Nipkow disk,",2019-03-29
00:02:24.600,00:02:28.760,which is basically a big disc with a spiral of holes in it.,2019-03-29
00:02:28.760,00:02:31.080,"- The inner pinholes do the scanning,",2019-03-29
00:02:31.080,00:02:34.280,and if I go fast enough you can see the scanning.,2019-03-29
00:02:34.280,00:02:37.040,- You would put a light behind this Nipkow disk,2019-03-29
00:02:37.040,00:02:42.400,"and so you'd have a spot of light which scans across your subject, say a person.",2019-03-29
00:02:42.400,00:02:48.360,And then there would be a reflected light off that person which would be picked up by some light sensors.,2019-03-29
00:02:48.360,00:02:53.480,That would create an electrical signal which you could transmit over distance to a receiver.,2019-03-29
00:02:53.480,00:02:59.480,"Now at the receiver you use that electrical signal to modulate the brightness of a light source,",2019-03-29
00:02:59.480,00:03:02.640,"and then in front of that you place a synchronized Nipkow disk,",2019-03-29
00:03:02.640,00:03:06.920,and so the result is a recreation of the image from the transmitter.,2019-03-29
00:03:06.920,00:03:12.520,"- So it was just barely at the limits of the ability to make a viewable picture,",2019-03-29
00:03:12.520,00:03:15.880,"and it was actually broadcast for a couple of years in Britain,",2019-03-29
00:03:15.880,00:03:20.680,and in America and other countries did experimental broadcasts using this technique.,2019-03-29
00:03:20.680,00:03:25.000,- This is arguably the first-ever broadcast television image.,2019-03-29
00:03:25.000,00:03:28.360,"It was broadcast for a few hours a day for several years,",2019-03-29
00:03:28.360,00:03:33.320,and it was used by engineers to perform experiments and try to improve the quality of the broadcast.,2019-03-29
00:03:33.320,00:03:37.480,- What it proved was that this wasn't the way to do it. [Laughs.],2019-03-29
00:03:37.480,00:03:42.280,"- So by 1939 mechanical TV was all but phased out,",2019-03-29
00:03:42.280,00:03:46.040,and it was replaced by all-electric TV.,2019-03-29
00:03:46.160,00:03:48.540,♫,2019-03-29
00:03:48.600,00:03:51.360,Specifically the cathode-ray tube.,2019-03-29
00:03:51.360,00:03:56.280,So this is a glass vacuum tube with an electron gun at the back.,2019-03-29
00:03:56.280,00:03:59.880,"And the electron gun would fire a beam of electrons at the screen,",2019-03-29
00:03:59.880,00:04:06.160,where it was coated in a chemical which produced light when it got hit by the electrons that's called a phosphor.,2019-03-29
00:04:06.160,00:04:10.120,"And using magnetic fields, this beam was scanned across the screen",2019-03-29
00:04:10.120,00:04:11.800,"top-to-bottom, left-to-right,",2019-03-29
00:04:11.800,00:04:17.280,"and you would vary the brightness of the beam by varying the voltage on a control electrode,",2019-03-29
00:04:17.280,00:04:23.240,essentially determining how many electrons would get sent out in that beam at any instant to hit the screen.,2019-03-29
00:04:23.240,00:04:25.600,"So, if you send out a lot of electrons you get a bright spot,",2019-03-29
00:04:25.650,00:04:28.040,"if you don't then you get a dark spot,",2019-03-29
00:04:28.040,00:04:31.000,and in that way you can produce a nice black-and-white image.,2019-03-29
00:04:31.000,00:04:33.000,"And if you're wondering about color TV,",2019-03-29
00:04:33.000,00:04:35.560,"well, there were a number of dead ends along the path",2019-03-29
00:04:35.560,00:04:38.800,to the red-green-blue pixel system that became the standard.,2019-03-29
00:04:38.800,00:04:41.600,Like this TV with a spinning color wheel.,2019-03-29
00:04:41.600,00:04:45.720,- I named the project Goldmark I in honor of Dr. Goldmark.,2019-03-29
00:04:45.720,00:04:49.800,The television part is a standard black-and-white picture tube.,2019-03-29
00:04:49.800,00:04:56.680,"- It displayed 24 frames per second but each frame required six scans: blue-green-red, blue-green-red.",2019-03-29
00:04:56.680,00:05:01.680,"It worked really well, but it wasn't backwards compatible with black-and-white TVs.",2019-03-29
00:05:02.400,00:05:04.440,"And this is a mini triniscope,",2019-03-29
00:05:04.440,00:05:08.720,"so named for its three cathode ray tubes, one for each color.",2019-03-29
00:05:08.720,00:05:11.400,And their images were combined with prisms.,2019-03-29
00:05:11.400,00:05:13.760,- The downside of a triniscope monitor,2019-03-29
00:05:13.760,00:05:18.040,is that for every inch you add diagonally to your screen,2019-03-29
00:05:18.040,00:05:23.280,the volume of the cabinet increases by like the power of something like three and a half.,2019-03-29
00:05:23.280,00:05:25.920,They get huge fast.,2019-03-29
00:05:25.920,00:05:30.120,"- So the ultimate solution was to have red, green, and blue phosphors for each pixel,",2019-03-29
00:05:30.120,00:05:33.160,and three electron guns to determine their relative brightness.,2019-03-29
00:05:33.960,00:05:39.200,"- Now, the number of lines those electron beams make across the screen is, in theory,",2019-03-29
00:05:39.200,00:05:42.640,525 every thirtieth of a second.,2019-03-29
00:05:42.640,00:05:47.720,"But this is achieved by scanning every other line each sixtieth of a second,",2019-03-29
00:05:47.720,00:05:50.880,so it actually takes two scans to make one frame.,2019-03-29
00:05:50.880,00:05:53.320,This is called interlacing.,2019-03-29
00:05:53.320,00:05:58.640,And what you'll notice watching this is that most of the time you're actually staring at a blank screen.,2019-03-29
00:05:58.640,00:06:03.960,"The illusion of a continuous moving image is made possible by our persistence of vision,",2019-03-29
00:06:03.960,00:06:09.240,"that is, we don't stop seeing something instantaneously after light stops entering our eyes.",2019-03-29
00:06:09.240,00:06:12.080,"- So, initially I was thinking this wouldn't be too hard to film",2019-03-29
00:06:12.080,00:06:17.200,"I mean, a thirtieth of a second or a sixtieth of a second, that's not terribly fast.",2019-03-29
00:06:17.200,00:06:23.960,"But then if you think about it, 262 and 1/2 lines being drawn every sixtieth of a second,",2019-03-29
00:06:23.960,00:06:31.920,"that is 15,750 lines drawn per second.",2019-03-29
00:06:33.080,00:06:34.000,"That is fast,",2019-03-29
00:06:34.000,00:06:36.880,"so if you want to be able to see the lines being drawn on,",2019-03-29
00:06:36.880,00:06:40.320,"you need to shoot faster than 15,000 frames per second,",2019-03-29
00:06:40.320,00:06:43.160,"a lot faster, really, to be able to see this clearly.",2019-03-29
00:06:43.160,00:06:49.260,and so I am using the Phantom v2512.,2019-03-29
00:06:50.000,00:06:51.880,That is the beast,2019-03-29
00:06:51.880,00:06:54.200,that is allowing me to produce these images.,2019-03-29
00:06:54.200,00:06:58.920,"Now the actual resolution of these TVs turned out to be around 480 lines,",2019-03-29
00:06:58.920,00:07:04.400,"so when you select 480p on YouTube, that's why this is an option.",2019-03-29
00:07:04.400,00:07:08.040,"And I guess it's worth pointing out that the ""tube"" in ""YouTube""",2019-03-29
00:07:08.040,00:07:11.120,"is this thing, a cathode-ray tube.",2019-03-29
00:07:11.120,00:07:15.720,"So in the time before light-sensitive chips like we all use in our cameras today,",2019-03-29
00:07:15.720,00:07:19.880,how did you actually create the image to display on a television?,2019-03-29
00:07:19.880,00:07:22.560,"Well, there were many vacuum tube designs.",2019-03-29
00:07:22.560,00:07:25.680,"One of the most common was the image orthicon tube,",2019-03-29
00:07:25.680,00:07:27.440,sometimes called Emmy for short.,2019-03-29
00:07:27.440,00:07:30.640,"In fact, that's where the name Emmys comes from.",2019-03-29
00:07:30.640,00:07:34.560,So the way it would work is you use the camera lens to focus an image,2019-03-29
00:07:34.560,00:07:40.160,"onto the front of the image orthicon tube, and that was coated with a photoelectric substance,",2019-03-29
00:07:40.160,00:07:43.760,so it would release electrons in proportion to the light that hit them.,2019-03-29
00:07:43.760,00:07:47.560,Now those electrons were collimated by magnetic fields and sent straight back.,2019-03-29
00:07:47.560,00:07:52.360,"So essentially you had an electron version of the image sent straight back to a target,",2019-03-29
00:07:52.360,00:07:55.360,"which was a very, very thin glass plate.",2019-03-29
00:07:55.360,00:08:00.520,"And of course where there's more electrons, that creates a more negative spot on this target.",2019-03-29
00:08:00.520,00:08:06.040,From the back of the tube you'd send forward an electron beam to scan across the target.,2019-03-29
00:08:06.040,00:08:08.200,"And so these electrons as they came in,",2019-03-29
00:08:08.200,00:08:13.440,"the more negative a spot that was on the target, the more that beam would get reflected.",2019-03-29
00:08:13.440,00:08:16.920,"And so that reflected beam was amplified in the tube,",2019-03-29
00:08:16.920,00:08:23.320,and then used as the signal to essentially determine how bright that part of the image should be.,2019-03-29
00:08:23.320,00:08:28.960,So this is how television images were created and displayed for decades.,2019-03-29
00:08:28.960,00:08:31.160,But here is the crazy thing:,2019-03-29
00:08:31.160,00:08:34.680,there was no way to record them.,2019-03-29
00:08:35.640,00:08:39.320,I mean the purpose of video or the purpose of electronic images,2019-03-29
00:08:39.320,00:08:43.360,was really to transmit something from one place to another.,2019-03-29
00:08:43.360,00:08:46.680,"""Television"" literally means ""seeing at a distance.""",2019-03-29
00:08:47.160,00:08:51.680,It's not about recording for replaying later as film was.,2019-03-29
00:08:51.680,00:08:53.960,- The thing that blew me away was,2019-03-29
00:08:53.960,00:09:00.240,realizing that video cameras existed for a couple decades before video tape.,2019-03-29
00:09:00.240,00:09:05.160,- That's right. That was the the era of live broadcasting,2019-03-29
00:09:05.160,00:09:07.240,- But this introduced some problems.,2019-03-29
00:09:07.240,00:09:12.560,"For example in North America, in the US, a lot of the TV programs were produced out in New York,",2019-03-29
00:09:12.560,00:09:16.400,"and there was a coaxial cable which went across the whole of the US,",2019-03-29
00:09:16.400,00:09:19.400,"and that could deliver programming to, say, Los Angeles.",2019-03-29
00:09:19.400,00:09:21.680,But it was at the wrong time.,2019-03-29
00:09:21.680,00:09:25.000,I mean a news broadcast from New York at 6:00 or 7:00 p.m.,2019-03-29
00:09:25.000,00:09:28.680,couldn't just be broadcast live at 3:00 or 4:00 p.m. on the West Coast.,2019-03-29
00:09:28.680,00:09:30.040,"It just didn't make any sense,",2019-03-29
00:09:30.040,00:09:31.640,So you needed to time-delay it.,2019-03-29
00:09:31.640,00:09:33.600,So how did they do it?,2019-03-29
00:09:33.600,00:09:36.760,"Well the answer was to take a film camera,",2019-03-29
00:09:36.760,00:09:40.400,"a cinema camera, and point it at a television screen,",2019-03-29
00:09:40.400,00:09:43.200,and actually film the television screen.,2019-03-29
00:09:43.200,00:09:45.640,Then you would quickly develop the film,2019-03-29
00:09:45.640,00:09:48.880,"and bring it back three hours later to broadcast it live,",2019-03-29
