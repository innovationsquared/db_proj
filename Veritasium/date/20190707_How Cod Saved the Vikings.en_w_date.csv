00:01:18.040,00:01:20.440,but likely much earlier.,2019-07-07
00:01:20.440,00:01:26.120,And doctors were powerless to cure the disease because no one knew what caused it.,2019-07-07
00:01:27.640,00:01:33.400,Scientific evidence only came to light in the early 1920s during an experiment in Vienna.,2019-07-07
00:01:33.400,00:01:37.680,It was discovered that children with rickets recovered miraculously,2019-07-07
00:01:37.680,00:01:42.080,after they were regularly allowed to play outside on a balcony.,2019-07-07

00:02:20.080,00:02:22.520,hence the epidemic of rickets.,2019-07-07
00:02:23.380,00:02:27.280,The notable exception here is the Vikings.,2019-07-07
00:02:27.280,00:02:30.880,"They occupied what is now Denmark, Norway, and Sweden",2019-07-07

00:03:43.180,00:03:47.940,That is a big cod liver.,2019-07-07
00:03:48.200,00:03:54.320,Just one meal of cod with liver and eggs supplies enough vitamin D to last you a month.,2019-07-07
00:03:54.320,00:03:58.720,And your body can store it because vitamin D is fat soluble.,2019-07-07
00:03:58.720,00:04:05.600,"To survive the dark winter months, and to build strong healthy bones in children, cod was essential.",2019-07-07
00:04:08.840,00:04:11.080,So were the Vikings just lucky?,2019-07-07

00:04:27.000,00:04:31.400,So is cod the only reason we still know about the Vikings?,2019-07-07
00:04:31.400,00:04:35.000,"Did cod, in a sense, create the Vikings?",2019-07-07
00:04:35.000,00:04:37.920,Well I think it's more complicated than that.,2019-07-07
00:04:37.920,00:04:42.360,The Vikings figured out how to use the cod to promote better health.,2019-07-07
00:04:42.360,00:04:49.480,One practice they passed down from generation to generation was extracting oil from the cod's livers.,2019-07-07

00:05:12.160,00:05:15.640,but I think it probably went something like this:,2019-07-07
00:05:15.640,00:05:19.920,"maybe some people noticed that cod liver oil drinkers were healthier,",2019-07-07

00:05:34.800,00:05:37.280,is a kind of proto-science.,2019-07-07
