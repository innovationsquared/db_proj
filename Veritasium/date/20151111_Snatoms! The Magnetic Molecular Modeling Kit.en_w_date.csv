00:00:05.780,00:00:09.480,"and then this is H2, the hydrogen molecule.",2015-11-11
00:00:09.500,00:00:14.200,"You can break it apart, add an oxygen atom and make H2Oâ€”water.",2015-11-11
00:00:14.880,00:00:17.800,"A carbon with four hydrogens, that is methane.",2015-11-11
00:00:17.800,00:00:21.820,And you can actually combine it with water to make: methanol.,2015-11-11

00:00:25.580,00:00:29.040,"And I am Derek Muller, the creator of a Youtube channel called Veritasium,",2015-11-11
00:00:29.040,00:00:31.380,which has nearly 3 million suscribers.,2015-11-11
00:00:31.560,00:00:36.240,"Through my videos, I teach science virtually to millions of people around the world.",2015-11-11
00:00:36.280,00:00:38.800,But some things are best learned hands-on.,2015-11-11
00:00:38.800,00:00:42.240,"Like chemistry. I mean, atoms are impossible to see",2015-11-11
00:00:42.240,00:00:45.300,and chemical notation can be very confusing for students.,2015-11-11
00:00:45.300,00:00:48.780,"And that is why, as a teacher for 7 years before I started Veritasium,",2015-11-11
00:00:48.780,00:00:51.880,I've always wished that something like this existed.,2015-11-11
00:00:51.920,00:00:55.640,Snatoms are an improvement over ball-and-stick models for three reasons:,2015-11-11
00:00:55.640,00:00:58.680,"1) They're quicker to put together and break apart,",2015-11-11
00:00:58.780,00:01:02.240,"2) Plus, they're a better representation of what a molecule actually looks like.",2015-11-11
00:01:02.240,00:01:06.240,"I mean, bonds are not sticks. They are overlapping electron orbitals.",2015-11-11
00:01:06.240,00:01:10.040,"3) And most important, Snatoms allow you to feel the attraction between atoms.",2015-11-11
00:01:10.600,00:01:14.220,And that helps break the misconception that bonds store energy.,2015-11-11
00:01:14.220,00:01:17.520,This is something that I talked to Hank Green about on SciShow Talk Show.,2015-11-11
00:01:17.580,00:01:19.420,Derek: Where is the energy coming from?,2015-11-11
00:01:19.440,00:01:20.720,"Hank: The bonds, man.",2015-11-11
00:01:20.720,00:01:24.320,"Derek: But my concern is this, right? If you think that there really is energy in bonds,",2015-11-11
00:01:24.660,00:01:25.920,Hank: Yup.,2015-11-11
00:01:25.920,00:01:28.880,Derek: Then you would imagine something like breaking those bonds open,2015-11-11
00:01:28.880,00:01:30.380,releases that energy.,2015-11-11
00:01:30.380,00:01:30.880,Hank: Right.,2015-11-11
00:01:30.880,00:01:31.920,Derek: Which is totally false!,2015-11-11
00:01:31.920,00:01:32.980,Hank: That is true.,2015-11-11
00:01:32.980,00:01:34.400,Derek: This is my point!,2015-11-11
00:01:34.400,00:01:35.060,(laughter),2015-11-11
00:01:35.100,00:01:37.200,"Derek: It's the formation of bonds that releases energy,",2015-11-11
00:01:37.200,00:01:39.580,and it's the breaking of bonds which takes energy.,2015-11-11
00:01:39.640,00:01:44.240,"With Snatoms, you can easily feel the work you need to do to break a bond, and you",2015-11-11
00:01:44.300,00:01:47.460,can hear the energy released when a new bond forms. [click],2015-11-11
00:01:47.480,00:01:50.500,I've been developing Snatoms for over two years.,2015-11-11
00:01:50.500,00:01:55.700,The first prototypes I made out of Styrofoam balls that I cut and put magnets in.,2015-11-11
00:01:55.700,00:01:58.060,You may have seen this picture on my Instagram.,2015-11-11
00:01:58.100,00:02:00.740,Then I made drawings for the project and had them 3D printed,2015-11-11
00:02:00.840,00:02:03.260,And then I created some injection molded prototypes,2015-11-11
00:02:03.280,00:02:06.820,which I spray-painted and used in my video ''5 Fun Physics Phenomena'',2015-11-11
00:02:06.820,00:02:10.180,Now I need your help to make this project a reality.,2015-11-11
00:02:10.180,00:02:13.580,Veritasium has showed me that there are millions of people out there passionate,2015-11-11
00:02:13.620,00:02:15.820,about helping others understand science.,2015-11-11
00:02:15.820,00:02:19.920,"So if you agree with me that this would help and Snatoms should exist in the world,",2015-11-11
00:02:19.920,00:02:24.000,then help me fund the production molds and magnets required to make this happen.,2015-11-11
00:02:24.000,00:02:25.680,A basic Snatoms kit would include,2015-11-11
00:02:25.680,00:02:27.780,"6 carbon atoms, 6 oxygens",2015-11-11
00:02:27.780,00:02:29.520,and 12 hydrogens.,2015-11-11
00:02:29.640,00:02:32.880,"That's all the atoms you need to make glucose, the basic sugar molecule.",2015-11-11
00:02:32.880,00:02:34.880,But of course with this building blocks you can build,2015-11-11
00:02:34.880,00:02:36.580,hundreds of other molecules.,2015-11-11
00:02:36.580,00:02:40.060,And I will make some video guides explaining how to use Snatoms,2015-11-11
00:02:40.060,00:02:43.540,"to learn about molecules, chemical bonding, geometry",2015-11-11
00:02:43.620,00:02:45.680,and balancing equations.,2015-11-11
00:02:45.680,00:02:49.580,"And, if we reach a stretch target I will add another element to the kit,",2015-11-11
00:02:49.580,00:02:54.020,like nitrogen. Plus if we reach a further stretch target I will build an app,2015-11-11
00:02:54.020,00:02:56.480,"that will gamify the process of learning, allowing users to learn",2015-11-11
00:02:56.480,00:02:59.680,about new molecules and capture their progress.,2015-11-11
00:02:59.680,00:03:03.180,"I think the best way to learn science is hands-on from a young age,",2015-11-11
00:03:03.180,00:03:07.320,"and if you want to help me make this happen, then support this Kickstarter.",2015-11-11
00:03:07.360,00:03:10.200,You don't have to buy a set of Snatoms (though that definitely would help),2015-11-11
00:03:10.200,00:03:13.780,But if you think is a good idea just share it with your friends on Twitter or Facebook.,2015-11-11
00:03:14.160,00:03:17.380,I really appreciate your support and I look forward to helping the world,2015-11-11
00:03:17.380,00:03:21.840,learn science physically in addition to through the internet.,2015-11-11
