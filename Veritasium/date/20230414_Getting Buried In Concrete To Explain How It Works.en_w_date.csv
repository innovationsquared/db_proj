00:00:00.000,00:00:03.180,I am about to get buried in concrete.,2023-04-14
00:00:03.180,00:00:04.410,"And while that's happening,",2023-04-14
00:00:04.410,00:00:07.410,I'm going to explain everything you need to know,2023-04-14
00:00:07.410,00:00:09.360,about this substance.,2023-04-14
00:00:09.360,00:00:11.970,So the first thing that I want to clear up is the difference,2023-04-14
00:00:11.970,00:00:13.920,"between cement and concrete,",2023-04-14
00:00:13.920,00:00:15.870,"because people often mix these up, okay?",2023-04-14
00:00:15.870,00:00:17.820,Cement is like the glue.,2023-04-14
00:00:17.820,00:00:20.280,It's the matrix of stuff.,2023-04-14
00:00:20.280,00:00:21.810,"Oh there, I feel it.",2023-04-14
00:00:21.810,00:00:23.850,"Okay, that feels good.",2023-04-14
00:00:23.850,00:00:27.570,"Now concrete is cement plus aggregate,",2023-04-14
00:00:27.570,00:00:30.060,so plus gravel and sand.,2023-04-14
00:00:30.060,00:00:33.810,And this is filling up really rather quickly.,2023-04-14
00:00:33.810,00:00:36.840,Cement is the most important man-made substance,2023-04-14
00:00:36.840,00:00:37.890,on the planet.,2023-04-14
00:00:37.890,00:00:42.360,We use more of it than any other substance apart from water.,2023-04-14
00:00:42.360,00:00:46.800,"Every year, 500 kilograms of cement are created",2023-04-14
00:00:46.800,00:00:49.890,"for every man, woman, and child on earth.",2023-04-14
00:00:49.890,00:00:53.700,And that amount of cement can make two cubic meters,2023-04-14
00:00:53.700,00:00:58.233,"of concrete, which is about two of these big fishbowls.",2023-04-14
00:00:59.160,00:01:00.993,This video is sponsored by Wren.,2023-04-14
00:01:01.920,00:01:04.710,I don't think people realize just how important concrete is.,2023-04-14
00:01:04.710,00:01:07.020,So here's another way to think about it.,2023-04-14
00:01:07.020,00:01:10.650,"Every year, we make a certain weight of goods out of copper,",2023-04-14
00:01:10.650,00:01:12.360,"more out of aluminum,",2023-04-14
00:01:12.360,00:01:16.110,"and then you have glass, asphalt, lime,",2023-04-14
00:01:16.110,00:01:18.780,"iron is a big one for all the steel,",2023-04-14
00:01:18.780,00:01:21.660,and then there's ceramic and wood.,2023-04-14
00:01:21.660,00:01:24.600,"But by far, the solid product we make the most of,",2023-04-14
00:01:24.600,00:01:28.320,"is cementitious material, essentially cement.",2023-04-14
00:01:28.320,00:01:33.320,We use as much of it as we do all other materials combined.,2023-04-14
00:01:33.450,00:01:35.730,And it's easy to see why.,2023-04-14
00:01:35.730,00:01:38.040,Concrete is liquid rock.,2023-04-14
00:01:38.040,00:01:40.770,You can pour it into any shape you like.,2023-04-14
00:01:40.770,00:01:43.920,It's strong and durable and inexpensive.,2023-04-14
00:01:43.920,00:01:45.870,And it is so easy to produce,2023-04-14
00:01:45.870,00:01:47.610,that people have been making a version of it,2023-04-14
00:01:47.610,00:01:49.740,for thousands of years.,2023-04-14
00:01:52.030,00:01:53.290,"To make primitive cement,",2023-04-14
00:01:53.290,00:01:55.570,"the key ingredient is limestone,",2023-04-14
00:01:55.570,00:01:57.610,which is basically calcium carbonate.,2023-04-14
00:01:57.610,00:02:00.430,"If you heat it up to around 1,000 degrees Celsius,",2023-04-14
00:02:00.430,00:02:03.280,"that drives off CO2 out of the rock,",2023-04-14
00:02:03.280,00:02:07.180,"leaving calcium oxide, which is also known as quicklime.",2023-04-14
00:02:07.180,00:02:10.930,"Now if you grind up the calcium oxide and mix it with water,",2023-04-14
00:02:10.930,00:02:12.550,you get an exothermic reaction,2023-04-14
00:02:12.550,00:02:14.830,"that creates calcium hydroxide,",2023-04-14
00:02:14.830,00:02:17.440,which you can pour into a mold.,2023-04-14
00:02:17.440,00:02:21.400,"And over a time, it will absorb CO2 from the atmosphere,",2023-04-14
00:02:21.400,00:02:26.400,turning back into calcium carbonate as the water evaporates.,2023-04-14
00:02:26.620,00:02:28.420,"Now, that's a pretty good primitive cement.",2023-04-14
00:02:28.420,00:02:31.060,"It's the first way that people ever made cement,",2023-04-14
00:02:31.060,00:02:32.860,but there are several drawbacks to it.,2023-04-14
00:02:32.860,00:02:35.800,"I mean, for one thing, you can't make the molds very big",2023-04-14
00:02:35.800,00:02:39.490,"because otherwise, CO2 can't penetrate all of the material",2023-04-14
00:02:39.490,00:02:40.510,and harden it.,2023-04-14
00:02:40.510,00:02:42.340,"Plus, it's not gonna work underwater",2023-04-14
00:02:42.340,00:02:45.433,where there is no CO2 to harden your mixture.,2023-04-14
00:02:46.270,00:02:49.150,The Romans discovered the solution to these problems.,2023-04-14
00:02:49.150,00:02:51.640,They added volcanic ash called pozzolana,2023-04-14
00:02:51.640,00:02:54.100,to the crushed limestone before heating it up.,2023-04-14
00:02:54.100,00:02:56.770,And they discovered this cement was much stronger,2023-04-14
00:02:56.770,00:02:58.390,and much more durable.,2023-04-14
00:02:58.390,00:02:59.223,They used it,2023-04-14
00:02:59.223,00:03:02.080,to create the largest unreinforced concrete dome,2023-04-14
00:03:02.080,00:03:07.080,"in the world, the Pantheon, which has stood for 2,000 years.",2023-04-14
00:03:07.360,00:03:10.060,"And they built concrete piers into the sea,",2023-04-14
00:03:10.060,00:03:12.130,which hardened underwater.,2023-04-14
00:03:12.130,00:03:14.353,Some of which are still standing today.,2023-04-14
00:03:15.850,00:03:18.460,"I did not expect it to feel this heavy,",2023-04-14
00:03:18.460,00:03:20.410,like it's already really weighing down my feet,2023-04-14
00:03:20.410,00:03:21.580,and making me slightly concerned,2023-04-14
00:03:21.580,00:03:23.770,about being able to get out.,2023-04-14
00:03:23.770,00:03:27.700,What I can tell you is that concrete is about three times,2023-04-14
00:03:27.700,00:03:29.830,as dense as water.,2023-04-14
00:03:29.830,00:03:30.970,- Are you able to lift a leg?,2023-04-14
00:03:30.970,00:03:31.803,I just wanna make sure,2023-04-14
00:03:31.803,00:03:33.220,that you're not gonna have like some suction.,2023-04-14
00:03:33.220,00:03:35.050,"- Yeah, okay, I'm gonna try to lift a leg",2023-04-14
00:03:35.050,00:03:36.460,just to see how bad it's gonna be.,2023-04-14
00:03:36.460,00:03:38.110,What I like is having my feet on the bottom,2023-04-14
00:03:38.110,00:03:39.550,and I'm not sure I can get them back down there,2023-04-14
00:03:39.550,00:03:40.383,"after I lift it up,",2023-04-14
00:03:40.383,00:03:41.500,"but oh, boy.",2023-04-14
00:03:41.500,00:03:43.240,"Okay, so that was like...",2023-04-14
00:03:43.240,00:03:45.590,I'm gonna try to lifting this leg pretty slowly,2023-04-14
00:03:46.600,00:03:48.100,and I was able to lift it.,2023-04-14
00:03:48.100,00:03:49.210,- Right.,2023-04-14
00:03:49.210,00:03:51.940,"- So at least up to this point, I am able to get out.",2023-04-14
00:03:51.940,00:03:54.040,My fear is that the concrete is so dense,2023-04-14
00:03:54.040,00:03:55.510,"that when it gets up around my chest,",2023-04-14
00:03:55.510,00:03:57.040,"it may apply a lot of pressure,",2023-04-14
00:03:57.040,00:03:57.873,making it hard to breathe.,2023-04-14
00:03:57.873,00:03:59.890,Yeah. - It's like being in a trench,2023-04-14
00:03:59.890,00:04:01.387,and having it cave in on you.,2023-04-14
00:04:01.387,00:04:04.240,"You cave in your lungs so you can't breathe,",2023-04-14
00:04:04.240,00:04:05.470,so that once they contract,2023-04-14
00:04:05.470,00:04:07.423,and the weight gets against your lungs.,2023-04-14
00:04:08.350,00:04:09.220,- That's gonna be hard.,2023-04-14
00:04:09.220,00:04:10.900,- Have you thought about that?,2023-04-14
00:04:10.900,00:04:12.550,"- Well, now that you mention it.",2023-04-14
00:04:12.550,00:04:15.550,"But we do have oxygen on hand, just in case.",2023-04-14
00:04:15.550,00:04:18.190,"Earlier, I practiced how I could get out of the bowl",2023-04-14
00:04:18.190,00:04:19.600,if I'm in trouble.,2023-04-14
00:04:19.600,00:04:20.590,- Do you feel that's okay?,2023-04-14
00:04:20.590,00:04:21.541,- That's no problem.,2023-04-14
00:04:21.541,00:04:22.461,"- Okay, great.",2023-04-14
00:04:22.461,00:04:25.711,(truck signal beeping),2023-04-14
00:04:31.630,00:04:34.510,So how did Roman concrete harden underwater?,2023-04-14
00:04:34.510,00:04:38.593,And in thick slabs that CO2 couldn't possibly penetrate?,2023-04-14
00:04:40.000,00:04:44.260,There is a claim that it was superior to modern concrete.,2023-04-14
00:04:44.260,00:04:45.523,"So, was it?",2023-04-14
00:04:46.360,00:04:49.600,"For centuries, the Roman recipe was lost.",2023-04-14
00:04:49.600,00:04:51.280,It was only discovered in a book,2023-04-14
00:04:51.280,00:04:53.800,in a Swiss monastery in the 1400s.,2023-04-14
00:04:53.800,00:04:56.260,"And since then, architects, scientists,",2023-04-14
00:04:56.260,00:04:58.330,and engineers have been experimenting,2023-04-14
00:04:58.330,00:05:00.340,with different cement recipes to try,2023-04-14
00:05:00.340,00:05:02.470,to achieve the best result.,2023-04-14
00:05:02.470,00:05:05.230,"Now it turns out that that incredible strength,",2023-04-14

00:05:07.870,00:05:09.160,"of the Roman cement,",2023-04-14
00:05:09.160,00:05:10.840,"that came from the pozzolana,",2023-04-14
00:05:10.840,00:05:13.060,that volcanic ash that was added.,2023-04-14
00:05:13.060,00:05:15.340,"And nearly 2,000 years later,",2023-04-14
00:05:15.340,00:05:18.580,people discovered that adding clay or shale to the limestone,2023-04-14
00:05:18.580,00:05:22.540,"before it was crushed and heated, produced the same effect.",2023-04-14
00:05:22.540,00:05:26.080,And the reason is that all of these materials contain silica,2023-04-14
00:05:26.080,00:05:30.190,and silica totally changes the chemistry of the cement.,2023-04-14
00:05:30.190,00:05:34.030,It means that it doesn't need to dry in order to harden.,2023-04-14
00:05:34.030,00:05:38.170,"In fact, the water becomes an integral part",2023-04-14
00:05:38.170,00:05:39.850,of that hardened concrete,2023-04-14
00:05:39.850,00:05:42.610,so that it actually achieves maximum strength,2023-04-14
00:05:42.610,00:05:44.473,when it sets underwater.,2023-04-14
00:05:46.270,00:05:49.150,- So this is the compressive cylinder curing room.,2023-04-14
00:05:49.150,00:05:51.910,We're required to maintain the concrete samples,2023-04-14
00:05:51.910,00:05:53.050,in 100% humidity.,2023-04-14
00:05:53.050,00:05:56.950,So we've chose to submerge them in water in a lime bath.,2023-04-14
00:05:56.950,00:05:59.140,- Every time concrete suppliers pour concrete,2023-04-14
00:05:59.140,00:06:00.250,"on a job site,",2023-04-14
00:06:00.250,00:06:02.380,they cast sample cylinders of the material,2023-04-14
00:06:02.380,00:06:03.640,so they can later test it,2023-04-14
00:06:03.640,00:06:06.010,to ensure it has the strength required.,2023-04-14
00:06:06.010,00:06:07.570,- So we actually intercept a little bit,2023-04-14
00:06:07.570,00:06:08.410,of the concrete going,2023-04-14
00:06:08.410,00:06:09.880,into whatever structure they're pouring:,2023-04-14
00:06:09.880,00:06:10.900,"a slab, a wall.",2023-04-14
00:06:10.900,00:06:12.850,"We'll intercept it into a wheelbarrow,",2023-04-14
00:06:12.850,00:06:14.770,"take the wheelbarrow over to our testing station,",2023-04-14
00:06:14.770,00:06:17.350,and start casting these compressive cylinders.,2023-04-14

00:06:18.910,00:06:19.930,checking it for strength.,2023-04-14
00:06:19.930,00:06:21.910,You can see these have been broken today.,2023-04-14
00:06:21.910,00:06:24.100,"- This strength increases over time,",2023-04-14
00:06:24.100,00:06:28.480,"so samples are tested at 7, 14, and 28 days",2023-04-14
00:06:28.480,00:06:31.480,when the concrete is said to have reached full strength.,2023-04-14
00:06:31.480,00:06:33.940,- So what we do is we list the date,2023-04-14
00:06:33.940,00:06:35.950,that there will be placed in the compression machine,2023-04-14
00:06:35.950,00:06:37.450,on top of every cylinder.,2023-04-14
00:06:37.450,00:06:39.970,"- In reality, it will continue strengthening",2023-04-14
00:06:39.970,00:06:40.843,after that.,2023-04-14
00:06:42.790,00:06:45.160,Samples are placed in a hydraulic press,2023-04-14
00:06:45.160,00:06:48.610,and then the pressure is increased on them until they fail.,2023-04-14
00:06:48.610,00:06:49.443,"- All right, ready? - Yeah, let's do it.",2023-04-14
00:06:49.443,00:06:51.070,- I'll start loading. - Sure.,2023-04-14
00:06:51.070,00:06:53.650,- We want to maintain around 30 psi per second.,2023-04-14
00:06:53.650,00:06:55.570,- And it's important to load at that rate.,2023-04-14

00:14:25.210,00:14:26.200,Okay.,2023-04-14
00:14:26.200,00:14:28.630,I was surprised to see that all the cylinders broke,2023-04-14
00:14:28.630,00:14:30.010,under about the same pressure.,2023-04-14
00:14:30.010,00:14:31.480,"I think, to me, really interesting",2023-04-14
00:14:31.480,00:14:34.870,"that you could have all of that cement, right?",2023-04-14
00:14:34.870,00:14:36.820,But you don't get appreciably...,2023-04-14
00:14:36.820,00:14:39.130,- Right. - Stronger than like this,2023-04-14
00:14:39.130,00:14:40.750,or that.,2023-04-14
00:14:40.750,00:14:43.570,Cement is the most expensive part of concrete.,2023-04-14
00:14:43.570,00:14:45.430,So if you can get away with reducing it down,2023-04-14
00:14:45.430,00:14:46.540,to 30% in the mix,2023-04-14
00:14:46.540,00:14:48.700,"and still get the same strength characteristics,",2023-04-14
00:14:48.700,00:14:51.160,well then you should definitely do that.,2023-04-14
00:14:51.160,00:14:53.410,The other thing that was interesting was pure cement seemed,2023-04-14
00:14:53.410,00:14:56.770,to flake and chip more as it was loaded.,2023-04-14
00:14:56.770,00:14:58.420,So it seemed like adding the aggregate,2023-04-14
00:14:58.420,00:15:00.520,actually helped the sample cohere,2023-04-14
00:15:00.520,00:15:03.533,and stay together even under all that load.,2023-04-14

00:15:07.780,00:15:12.010,So was Roman concrete superior to modern concrete?,2023-04-14
00:15:12.010,00:15:14.560,"Well, the answer is no in short.",2023-04-14
00:15:14.560,00:15:17.050,I mean there were some surprising advantages,2023-04-14
00:15:17.050,00:15:18.070,that Roman concrete had.,2023-04-14
00:15:18.070,00:15:18.903,"For example,",2023-04-14
00:15:18.903,00:15:21.910,it was actually less well-mixed than modern concrete.,2023-04-14
00:15:21.910,00:15:26.770,So there were little blocks of undissolved calcium oxide,2023-04-14
00:15:26.770,00:15:30.340,or quicklime that remained inside Roman concrete.,2023-04-14
00:15:30.340,00:15:32.530,And then what happened is when the concrete cracked,2023-04-14
00:15:32.530,00:15:33.730,"and water got in there,",2023-04-14
00:15:33.730,00:15:36.130,"it would dissolve that calcium oxide,",2023-04-14
00:15:36.130,00:15:37.660,"forming calcium hydroxide,",2023-04-14
00:15:37.660,00:15:41.560,and then you would get the new growth of calcium carbonate.,2023-04-14
00:15:41.560,00:15:45.130,So Roman concrete was actually self-healing.,2023-04-14
00:15:45.130,00:15:48.070,That's kind of a fascinating advantage.,2023-04-14
00:15:48.070,00:15:49.930,"But I would say by and large, you know,",2023-04-14
00:15:49.930,00:15:51.400,"when we look back at the Roman structures,",2023-04-14
00:15:51.400,00:15:53.290,we only see the ones that have survived to this day.,2023-04-14
00:15:53.290,00:15:55.510,So there is a survivor bias.,2023-04-14
00:15:55.510,00:15:57.460,"And finally, there's the issue of cost.",2023-04-14
00:15:57.460,00:15:59.320,We could make very strong concretes,2023-04-14
00:15:59.320,00:16:01.660,that could last an incredibly long time,2023-04-14
00:16:01.660,00:16:04.540,but we choose not to because it's just cheaper,2023-04-14
00:16:04.540,00:16:07.113,and we don't expect our buildings to last that long.,2023-04-14
00:16:08.530,00:16:10.450,"Before the concrete goes out on site,",2023-04-14
00:16:10.450,00:16:12.370,they have to make sure it's the right consistency,2023-04-14
00:16:12.370,00:16:13.240,for the customer;,2023-04-14
00:16:13.240,00:16:15.880,not too dry and not too runny.,2023-04-14
00:16:15.880,00:16:17.800,This can be adjusted with water,2023-04-14
00:16:17.800,00:16:19.330,but you don't really wanna do that,2023-04-14
00:16:19.330,00:16:21.460,because that can also affect the strength.,2023-04-14
00:16:21.460,00:16:25.660,"So here, they use modern chemicals like superplasticizers.",2023-04-14
00:16:25.660,00:16:26.830,"- Up here on the top left,",2023-04-14
00:16:26.830,00:16:28.690,you have our dispensing units,2023-04-14
00:16:28.690,00:16:31.180,for all our chemical add mixtures.,2023-04-14
00:16:31.180,00:16:32.620,- And that's what they're adding now,2023-04-14
00:16:32.620,00:16:33.850,of superplasticizer.,2023-04-14
00:16:33.850,00:16:36.640,It makes the concrete easier to work and spread around,2023-04-14
00:16:36.640,00:16:39.730,without really changing the water content very much.,2023-04-14
00:16:39.730,00:16:41.410,"To check that the consistency is right,",2023-04-14
00:16:41.410,00:16:44.770,they perform something called a slump test or spread test.,2023-04-14
00:16:44.770,00:16:48.883,"- We're gonna fill the cone to the top nice and level,",2023-04-14
00:16:50.140,00:16:52.450,and we're gonna pull that metal cone off.,2023-04-14
00:16:52.450,00:16:54.910,Measure the distance it travels on the board.,2023-04-14

00:17:02.954,00:17:05.026,Right on a 27 on that one.,2023-04-14
00:17:05.026,00:17:05.859,- Yeah.,2023-04-14
00:17:05.859,00:17:07.450,"- And go this way,",2023-04-14
00:17:07.450,00:17:09.283,right on a 27 on that one.,2023-04-14
00:17:10.270,00:17:11.260,- So why is it so important,2023-04-14
00:17:11.260,00:17:13.390,that you got the right consistency of concrete?,2023-04-14
00:17:13.390,00:17:14.980,- You don't want it too dry.,2023-04-14
00:17:14.980,00:17:17.020,You want it wet enough to flow,2023-04-14
00:17:17.020,00:17:19.840,"and fill up whatever container you're trying to fill,",2023-04-14
00:17:19.840,00:17:23.140,"in this case, the sphere with you in it.",2023-04-14
00:17:23.140,00:17:24.850,"- So the question you're probably wondering is,",2023-04-14
00:17:24.850,00:17:28.450,how long can I stay in here before the concrete hardens?,2023-04-14
00:17:28.450,00:17:32.140,The usual answer is about four hours without agitation.,2023-04-14
00:17:32.140,00:17:34.270,And that's why when you see concrete trucks driving,2023-04-14
00:17:34.270,00:17:36.580,"down the road, that drum has to be turning",2023-04-14
00:17:36.580,00:17:38.170,to keep the concrete agitated,2023-04-14
00:17:38.170,00:17:40.000,and prevent it from setting up.,2023-04-14
00:17:40.000,00:17:42.340,But what happens if the truck breaks down,2023-04-14
00:17:42.340,00:17:45.340,"or there's a traffic jam or something breaks,",2023-04-14
00:17:45.340,00:17:48.700,"then, at times, concrete does harden inside the drum",2023-04-14
00:17:48.700,00:17:51.670,of these trucks and that is a terrible outcome.,2023-04-14
00:17:51.670,00:17:53.440,But there is one thing you can do,2023-04-14
00:17:53.440,00:17:56.350,to slow the concrete down from setting,2023-04-14
00:17:56.350,00:18:01.240,and that is to add some regular pop like Coke.,2023-04-14
00:18:02.140,00:18:04.570,The sugars inside this coke,2023-04-14
00:18:04.570,00:18:09.010,actually prevent the setting up process from happening,2023-04-14
00:18:09.010,00:18:11.680,and that can buy you a few hours.,2023-04-14
00:18:11.680,00:18:13.690,"So apparently these truck drivers,",2023-04-14
00:18:13.690,00:18:17.140,they drive around with a few two-liter bottles of pop,2023-04-14
00:18:17.140,00:18:18.610,inside their cab,2023-04-14
00:18:18.610,00:18:21.640,and so they can dump it in their load if they have to,2023-04-14
00:18:21.640,00:18:22.810,to prevent it from setting up.,2023-04-14
00:18:22.810,00:18:26.473,So hopefully that means I'll get out okay too.,2023-04-14
00:18:28.240,00:18:31.150,But how does concrete actually harden?,2023-04-14
00:18:31.150,00:18:34.090,"Well, you have the dry mixture of gravel, sand,",2023-04-14
00:18:34.090,00:18:37.660,and cement powder and then you add water.,2023-04-14
00:18:37.660,00:18:40.810,"The water starts dissolving the cement powder grains,",2023-04-14
00:18:40.810,00:18:43.090,"so ions enter solution,",2023-04-14
00:18:43.090,00:18:46.390,and some of those ions are calcium hydroxide.,2023-04-14
00:18:46.390,00:18:49.843,So that's what makes concrete a very basic solution.,2023-04-14
00:18:50.800,00:18:52.120,What do you see?,2023-04-14
00:18:52.120,00:18:55.180,"- We're approaching 12, 11.8.",2023-04-14
00:18:55.180,00:18:59.620,- So the pH of concrete can get up to 12 or 13.,2023-04-14
00:18:59.620,00:19:03.910,"The pH of this is 11.8 and that's incredibly basic,",2023-04-14
00:19:03.910,00:19:06.130,"which means if it's on your skin, if it's on your body,",2023-04-14
00:19:06.130,00:19:10.210,it can be dissolving your skin and cells.,2023-04-14
00:19:10.210,00:19:12.760,Being buried in concrete is sort of like jumping,2023-04-14
00:19:12.760,00:19:14.260,in a bath of bleach.,2023-04-14
00:19:14.260,00:19:16.540,And that's why I'm actually wearing a dry suit,2023-04-14
00:19:16.540,00:19:18.100,and some latex gloves.,2023-04-14
00:19:18.100,00:19:19.960,"Yeah, it's not something you want to try at home.",2023-04-14
00:19:19.960,00:19:23.800,So do not try swimming in concrete.,2023-04-14
00:19:23.800,00:19:26.860,So now the ions are dissolved in the solution.,2023-04-14
00:19:26.860,00:19:28.510,"And remember, the most common compound",2023-04-14
00:19:28.510,00:19:31.480,in cement is tricalcium silicate.,2023-04-14
00:19:31.480,00:19:33.370,"As it reacts with the water,",2023-04-14
00:19:33.370,00:19:37.480,"crystals start to form of calcium silicate hydrates,",2023-04-14
00:19:37.480,00:19:39.700,plus other hydrate minerals.,2023-04-14
00:19:39.700,00:19:43.690,"And all these crystals grow and become interlocking,",2023-04-14
00:19:43.690,00:19:46.000,causing the concrete to harden.,2023-04-14
00:19:46.000,00:19:47.740,Note that the water is essential,2023-04-14
00:19:47.740,00:19:49.930,to the formation of these crystals.,2023-04-14
00:19:49.930,00:19:52.030,"So water is not evaporating,",2023-04-14
00:19:52.030,00:19:53.680,it's not drying out.,2023-04-14
00:19:53.680,00:19:57.760,It's actually becoming part of the solid concrete material.,2023-04-14
00:19:57.760,00:20:01.210,And that's why this chemistry is called cement hydration.,2023-04-14
00:20:01.210,00:20:03.670,It's also why freshly poured concrete should be kept,2023-04-14
00:20:03.670,00:20:05.953,in as damp an environment as possible.,2023-04-14
00:20:08.620,00:20:11.320,Las Vegas is so dry they frequently set up misters,2023-04-14
00:20:11.320,00:20:13.360,to spray around new concrete,2023-04-14
