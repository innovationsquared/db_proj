00:00:12.000,00:00:13.540,I can see you.,2018-12-23
00:00:13.660,00:00:15.940,Do you know what went wrong in-uh.. during the launch..?,2018-12-23

00:00:54.540,00:00:57.380,But that - - is when something went wrong,2018-12-23
00:00:57.720,00:01:04.240,"Uhh. there was thermal breach between a line of cold helium, and a line of propellant.",2018-12-23

00:01:06.820,00:01:09.720,This caused the failure of the altitude control thrusters.,2018-12-23
00:01:09.720,00:01:13.160,The satellites seemed to have been injected into some random direction.,2018-12-23

00:02:07.660,00:02:10.700,And they could use that fuel to attempt to correct their orbits.,2018-12-23
00:02:10.700,00:02:13.260,So they used the propellant on board -,2018-12-23
00:02:13.265,00:02:15.855,They did some of these maneuvers to bring them into stable orbit -,2018-12-23

00:04:24.680,00:04:28.080,Why we could do it - is because it's a very predictable effect.,2018-12-23

00:04:48.780,00:04:52.380,You wouldn't be able to measure any change in the rate the clock is ticking.,2018-12-23
00:04:52.380,00:05:02.080,The relativity comes when you compare two clocks which are distant enough to feel the curvature of space and time.,2018-12-23
00:05:02.080,00:05:06.800,The clocks on the satellites - there are a couple of different types - are all atomic clocks.,2018-12-23
00:05:06.800,00:05:10.740,The primary clock typically is a passive hydrogen MASER clock.,2018-12-23

00:06:05.700,00:06:07.720,In other words - red-shifted.,2018-12-23
00:06:07.840,00:06:12.360,"And the closer the satellite is to Earth, the more red-shifted the microwaves would appear.",2018-12-23

00:06:35.020,00:06:40.900,This gravitational redshift was previously measured most precisely in 1976.,2018-12-23

00:07:19.920,00:07:25.120,The results matched the predictions of general relativity down to a 140 parts per million.,2018-12-23
