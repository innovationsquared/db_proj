00:00:50.080,00:00:55.840,"""Why should we expect the universe to be 5 percent ordinary baryonic matter in the first place?""",0.0258
00:00:55.840,00:00:58.440,"The answer is because, with that density,",0.0
00:00:58.440,00:01:04.440,we can explain the relative abundances of different elements that we observe in the universe.,0.0

00:01:12.920,00:01:15.760,there were all of these neutrons and protons whizzing around.,0.0

00:01:40.720,00:01:47.060,"And, this is a less stable nucleus. And as quickly as it formed, it would get smashed apart.",0.228
00:01:47.120,00:01:49.760,"But, by about 10 seconds after the big bang,",0.0
00:01:49.760,00:01:53.920,the universe had cooled sufficiently that deuterium could form.,0.0
00:01:53.920,00:01:57.640,"And as soon as it did, it would rapidly fuse into helium.",0.0
00:01:57.640,00:02:02.680,The rate at which this happened depended on the density of matter in the early universe.,0.0258

00:03:25.960,00:03:31.440,"And using the value of 26 deuterium nuclei per million hydrogen nuclei,",0.34
00:03:31.440,00:03:35.640,"well, we can work out the ratio of baryonic matter to photons,",0.296
00:03:35.640,00:03:41.480,and that is how we work out that there should be about five percent baryonic matter in the universe.,0.0258
00:03:41.960,00:03:43.480,So in the late 1990s,0.0
00:03:43.480,00:03:47.000,scientists went looking for all this baryonic matter.,0.0258
00:03:47.000,00:03:49.600,It was a census of sorts.,0.0

00:04:08.920,00:04:13.560,it only makes up barely 20 percent of all the baryonic matter.,0.0258
00:04:14.160,00:04:16.280,So where is the rest?,0.0
00:04:17.120,00:04:23.440,"Well, not all ordinary matter is glowing brightly or is illuminated by nearby stars",0.5463
00:04:23.440,00:04:28.320,It's not dark matter but it is ordinary matter that is just in darkness.,-0.3372
00:04:29.000,00:04:31.880,"And so if you want to find those baryons,",0.144
00:04:31.880,00:04:34.840,"well, one way is to use a backlight",0.2732
00:04:35.200,00:04:38.000,"-- a bright source of light very far away,",0.4404
00:04:38.000,00:04:41.160,and that also means in the very early universe.,0.0
00:04:41.160,00:04:43.800,And quasars are the perfect backlight.,0.5719
00:04:44.480,00:04:49.680,Their luminosity can be thousands of times that of whole galaxies.,0.0
00:04:49.680,00:04:53.880,The light comes from the accretion disk of a supermassive black hole,0.0

00:04:55.840,00:04:58.440,as it engulfs all this matter.,0.0323
00:04:59.080,00:05:00.920,And since it is so distant,0.0
00:05:00.920,00:05:04.840,the light we receive from quasars is heavily redshifted.,0.0

00:05:21.640,00:05:26.080,at over 560 nanometers -- that is yellow light.,0.0
00:05:26.880,00:05:30.240,What's fascinating is if you look to the left of this peak,0.5423
00:05:30.240,00:05:32.560,you see many little dips.,0.0
00:05:32.560,00:05:36.680,These are absorption lines created by neutral hydrogen atoms,0.25
00:05:36.680,00:05:39.880,that lie along our line of sight with the quasar.,0.0
00:05:39.880,00:05:43.400,When light from the quasar reaches neutral hydrogen,0.0516
00:05:43.400,00:05:45.840,the photons that can excite the electrons,0.4767
00:05:45.840,00:05:49.280,from the ground state to the first excited state are absorbed.,0.34
00:05:49.280,00:05:52.360,"This is the same Lyman-alpha transition,",0.0
00:05:52.360,00:05:55.720,but since these patches of hydrogen gas are closer to us,0.0
00:05:55.720,00:05:58.200,they are less redshifted,0.0
00:05:58.200,00:06:05.360,so the notches they make in the spectrum are at shorter and shorter wavelengths the closer the gas is to us.,0.0
00:06:06.080,00:06:09.920,This has been described as the Lyman-alpha forest.,0.0
00:06:10.880,00:06:13.240,It's like a one-dimensional map,0.3612
00:06:13.240,00:06:17.320,that shows us where and how much neutral hydrogen gas,0.0
00:06:17.320,00:06:20.680,lies along the line connecting us to the quasar.,-0.4215
00:06:23.440,00:06:26.800,Adding all of that neutral hydrogen gas into our baryon budget,0.0
00:06:26.800,00:06:29.480,brings us almost to 50 percent.,0.0
00:06:30.160,00:06:33.040,So where is the other half of the baryons?,0.0
00:06:33.680,00:06:37.440,"Well, computer simulations of the entire universe suggested",0.2732
00:06:37.440,00:06:43.640,they are out there just in between the galaxies in these sheets or filaments,0.0
00:06:43.640,00:06:48.920,and they're very spread out -- just one to ten particles per cubic meter.,0.0
00:06:48.920,00:06:54.960,"Plus, these particles are ionized so they don't absorb the light like the neutral hydrogen gas.",0.3612
00:06:54.960,00:07:00.000,"And they're in a temperature range between about 100,000 and 10 million Kelvin,",0.0
00:07:00.000,00:07:03.360,"a range astronomers like to refer to as warm-hot,",0.3612
00:07:03.360,00:07:09.400,so this is known as the warm-hot intergalactic medium or WHIM for short.,0.0
00:07:09.400,00:07:12.640,But finding the WHIM has been a real challenge,0.1154
00:07:12.640,00:07:14.800,"because they're ionized, because of their temperature,",0.0
00:07:14.800,00:07:20.360,they only emit or absorb in the high energy UV or low energy X-rays.,0.2732
00:07:20.560,00:07:25.560,"Now, some people have used very sophisticated techniques to try to find the WHIM",0.5984
00:07:25.560,00:07:29.280,but then recently a naturally occurring physical phenomenon,0.0
00:07:29.280,00:07:32.400,allowed us to find all of the missing baryons.,-0.296
00:07:32.400,00:07:33.640,Let's find out how.,0.0
00:07:34.760,00:07:37.720,First we need to talk lightning,0.0
00:07:37.720,00:07:39.800,and I promise this is related.,0.3182
00:07:39.800,00:07:45.000,Okay so did you know that it's possible to detect lightning from the other side of the earth?,0.2263
00:07:45.600,00:07:51.400,This is because lightning produces a flash of electromagnetic radiation in all parts of the spectrum.,0.0
00:07:51.400,00:07:57.020,I mean we see the white light but there's also broad spectrum radio waves which are released,0.0
00:07:57.020,00:08:01.080,and if you were nearby you could detect those as a pulse.,0.0
00:08:01.080,00:08:06.680,But the very low frequency radio waves can actually travel up and out of the atmosphere,-0.4748
00:08:06.680,00:08:10.200,and they get guided along the Earth's magnetic field lines,0.0
00:08:10.200,00:08:12.680,out several radii from the Earth,0.0
00:08:12.680,00:08:16.720,and then back down where they can be detected in the other hemisphere.,0.0
00:08:16.720,00:08:21.440,"Except if they're detected there they don't come in as a single pulse,",0.0
00:08:21.440,00:08:24.720,instead they are spread out as a whistler.,0.0
00:08:24.720,00:08:27.120,Now if you play these radio waves through a speaker,0.34
00:08:27.120,00:08:29.720,"we can actually hear them, so listen to this.",0.0
00:08:34.920,00:08:37.280,You hear that descending tone,0.0
00:08:37.280,00:08:39.920,that sounds like a sci-fi laser gun?,0.0258
00:08:39.920,00:08:43.240,"Yeah, that is lightning on the other side of the earth.",0.296
00:08:43.760,00:08:45.560,So what's happening here?,0.0
00:08:45.560,00:08:49.480,"Well, as the radio waves travel through the earth's magnetosphere",0.2732
00:08:49.480,00:08:53.400,"they encounter free electrons, which slows them down",0.5106
00:08:53.400,00:08:58.440,and more for the lower frequency waves: this is dispersion.,-0.3535
00:08:58.440,00:09:02.280,Just as a prism separates white light into its component colors,0.0
00:09:02.280,00:09:07.800,the plasma in the magnetosphere separates the radio waves into its component frequencies:,0.0
00:09:07.800,00:09:10.920,"low frequencies are slowed down more than high frequencies,",-0.2732
00:09:10.920,00:09:14.440,so what started as a pulse ends up as a whistler.,0.0
00:09:14.440,00:09:18.440,And the amount of dispersion tells you how many free electrons,0.5106
00:09:18.440,00:09:21.040,that radio wave had to pass through to reach the detector.,0.0258
00:09:21.960,00:09:24.880,Now just imagine we could do something very similar,0.0
00:09:24.880,00:09:28.360,to find all the ionized baryons in the universe.,0.0
00:09:28.360,00:09:35.400,All we would need is a bright flash of radio waves somewhere in the distant universe,0.4404
00:09:35.400,00:09:42.200,"and as if on cue in 2007 astronomers found the first fast radio burst,",0.0
00:09:42.200,00:09:48.320,which is just what it sounds like: a very short-duration pulse of intense radio waves.,0.4215
00:09:48.320,00:09:52.760,"And it came from the deep universe, from other galaxies.",0.0
00:09:53.120,00:09:56.040,"Now, these pulses can be incredibly powerful,",0.4754
00:09:56.040,00:10:00.360,"I'm talking billions or trillions of times as powerful as the sun,",0.4215
00:10:00.360,00:10:03.320,but they last for on order of a millisecond.,0.0
00:10:03.960,00:10:06.080,"We don't really know what creates them,",0.3321
00:10:06.080,00:10:10.100,though some people suspect that it's magnetars or neutron stars,-0.296
00:10:10.100,00:10:14.400,or some sort of collision between these very powerful massive objects,0.0772
00:10:14.400,00:10:16.920,like black holes and neutron stars.,0.3612
00:10:16.920,00:10:22.760,But for our purposes all we need to know is that those flashes exist,0.0
00:10:22.760,00:10:25.520,and that we can use them to look at their dispersion,0.0
00:10:25.520,00:10:29.960,and figure out how many ionized baryons are between us and the source.,0.0
00:10:29.960,00:10:33.880,And this is exactly what one recent paper did in Nature:,0.0
00:10:33.880,00:10:39.160,they plotted out the dispersion measure of several of these fast radio bursts,0.0
00:10:39.160,00:10:42.840,versus the redshift of their host galaxy.,0.0
00:10:42.840,00:10:47.840,"And what they found was, sure enough, the further out these fast radio bursts were",0.3182
00:10:47.840,00:10:51.480,the more dispersed their signal when it reached the earth.,0.1027
00:10:51.480,00:10:53.800,And in fact using their measurements,0.0
00:10:53.800,00:10:58.120,"they were able to estimate the total baryonic matter that is out there,",0.0972
00:10:58.680,00:11:01.640,"and that includes all the ionized particles in the WHIM,",0.0
00:11:01.640,00:11:04.640,and they found that it was five percent.,0.0
00:11:05.400,00:11:09.120,They found the missing baryons. Roughly 50 percent of them,-0.296
00:11:09.120,00:11:12.600,are in that warm-hot intergalactic medium,0.0
00:11:12.600,00:11:16.480,and so this validates what we had been thinking the whole time.,0.4763
00:11:17.320,00:11:20.920,"You know, what surprised me in making this video was realizing",0.2263
00:11:20.920,00:11:23.800,just how little of the ordinary matter from the big bang,0.0258
00:11:23.800,00:11:26.080,"ended up in things like stars and galaxies,",0.3612
00:11:26.080,00:11:29.320,what I normally consider as the stuff of the universe.,0.0
00:11:29.320,00:11:32.800,"No, that's only like 10 or 20 percent of all the baryonic matter.",0.3818
00:11:33.240,00:11:36.280,So it turns out the formation of these interesting structures,0.4019
00:11:36.280,00:11:38.480,is a really inefficient process.,0.0
00:11:39.040,00:11:42.680,But this finding is yet another triumph for science.,0.631
