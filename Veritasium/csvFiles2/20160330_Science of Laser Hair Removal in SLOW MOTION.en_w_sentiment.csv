00:02:52.240,00:02:54.480,So what's actually going on here?,0.0
00:02:54.820,00:02:58.480,"Well dark eyes, skin, and hair contain a molecule called melanin,",0.2732
00:02:58.860,00:03:04.300,"and melanin absorbs a wide range of wavelengths of light, especially in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum,",0.0
00:03:04.300,00:03:10.440,"and this makes it an ideal shield against the sun's harmful rays, which is why you get a tan when you go out in the sun.",0.5267
00:03:10.440,00:03:14.380,That's your body producing and releasing more melanin in the skin.,0.0
00:03:14.380,00:03:20.280,"But, the idea with laser hair removal is to get the melanin in dark hairs to absorb the laser light",0.0
00:03:20.280,00:03:23.000,without the skin around it absorbing much of that energy.,0.2732
00:03:23.000,00:03:27.060,"So, it actually works best if you have really dark hairs and light skin.",0.6369
00:03:27.840,00:03:31.940,Infrared lasers are commonly used because melanin absorbs in this part of the spectrum,0.0
00:03:32.040,00:03:35.880,more than other common molecules in the skin like water and oxyhemoglobin.,0.3612
00:03:36.200,00:03:40.480,"Red lasers, at 755nm, are also often used for the same reason.",0.0
00:03:40.900,00:03:46.040,"As the melanin absorbs the laser energy, the hair heats up to well over 100 degrees Celsius,",0.4939

00:03:49.720,00:03:52.400,and this puffs the hair up a little bit like a cheeto.,0.3008
00:03:52.720,00:03:57.840,"It's that expanding water vapor. Looking closely at this shot, you can actually see the bubbles on the hair",0.0

00:04:00.560,00:04:06.660,"But, the objective is not to destroy the hair, it's to actually use the hair to destroy the germ cells",-0.2441

00:04:10.180,00:04:14.120,"So, it's kind of like using the hair to kill the hair.",-0.5413
00:04:14.240,00:04:19.160,This image shows a cross section of three hair follicles following a laser hair removal treatment.,0.0
00:04:19.460,00:04:22.840,"The one in the middle contained little melanin, and therefore, shows no damage.",0.3875
00:04:22.840,00:04:27.740,"The other two show the hair shaft has been destroyed, rupturing the inner root sheath",-0.4939

00:04:30.140,00:04:33.780,Cells suffer damage when their temperature rises above 60 degrees Celsius.,-0.7717
00:04:33.780,00:04:39.740,"This is because at that temperature, the bonds in proteins and collagen molecules start breaking apart,",0.0
00:04:39.740,00:04:41.800,and that's a process known as denaturation.,0.0
00:04:41.800,00:04:46.800,"So, the hotter it is and the longer that temperature is maintained, the more denaturation occurs",0.0
00:04:46.800,00:04:49.360,and the higher the likelihood that that cell will die.,-0.5994
00:04:49.360,00:04:54.060,"Now, if you cause enough damage to the cells in the follicle that make the hair,",-0.4939

00:04:56.080,00:04:58.600,and that is the goal of laser hair removal.,0.0
00:04:58.600,00:05:03.680,This sequence of ultrashort pulses is used to ensure that the heat doesn't spread too far,0.3818

00:05:06.120,00:05:11.440,"So, the idea is the hair heats up, damages the germ cells right next to it, but then the laser light turns off",-0.2382
00:05:11.440,00:05:16.500,"before that heat can spread too much further, and then you hit the hair with another very short pulse again.",0.0
00:05:16.500,00:05:21.640,"If you were instead just to keep heating the hair, it would heat not only the germ cells around it,",0.0
00:05:21.640,00:05:25.880,"but also your skin that you don't want to damage, and you would end up with burns.",0.4782
00:05:25.880,00:05:29.280,"So, that's the reason for the series of pulses that we saw.",0.0
00:05:29.740,00:05:32.880,"But, if you think about it, this is kind of a weird irony.",-0.3291
00:05:33.160,00:05:37.240,"I mean melanin is a molecule meant to protect us, meant to protect our skin",0.6369

00:05:39.420,00:05:43.460,and that's why it absorbs that light before it can penetrate further into your body and do damage.,-0.4939
00:05:43.460,00:05:49.500,"But now with laser hair removal, we're using melanin - it's unique absorption powers - against it.",0.0
00:05:49.520,00:05:55.700,"By overpowering it with lots of laser energy, we get it to heat up the hair to such high temperatures that",0.2732

00:06:01.220,00:06:05.440,"So, we are using melanin's powers against it.",0.0
00:06:05.800,00:06:09.600,"Normally before a laser hair removal procedure, the hair is shaved",0.0
00:06:09.600,00:06:11.140,and that serves a few purposes.,0.0
00:06:11.140,00:06:15.780,"For one thing, not too much energy goes into burning the external hair, which does you no good",-0.4973
00:06:15.780,00:06:20.100,"in the first place, and, second, it prevents the hot hair from landing on the skin and causing surface burns.",0.0772
00:06:20.100,00:06:23.320,"Well, we found that shaved patches were less interesting to watch, because you can't really",0.5434

00:07:30.680,00:07:35.860,"so I will definitely be listening to, uh, my audio books. In fact, the audio book I'm listening to at the moment",0.4522
