00:01:30.420,00:01:34.260,So the problem is that the brain has what's called the blood-brain barrier,-0.539
00:01:34.260,00:01:42.040,which lines the blood vessels of the brain and prevents molecules moving from the bloodstream into the brain.,0.0772

00:02:09.640,00:02:16.600,"And then wherever we apply the ultrasound, the sound waves cause the bubbles to expand and contract in size,",0.3182

00:02:23.340,00:02:26.900,So they get that blood-brain barrier that's normally caused by really tight,-0.128

00:03:49.060,00:03:53.400,[Derek] Is this a special ultrasound for... mice?,0.4019

00:04:20.320,00:04:24.090,[Mikhail] Yeah. So it's going to give us an image of the anatomy of the brain,0.296
00:04:24.090,00:04:27.640,and allow us to target the focus of this ultrasound transducer,0.2263

00:04:39.700,00:04:43.520,That allows a diffusion of what is essentially a,0.0

00:04:49.280,00:04:53.220,The hippocampus is a fairly large structure that's important in the formation of memory,0.2023
