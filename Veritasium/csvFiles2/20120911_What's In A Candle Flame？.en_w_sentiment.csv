00:00:00.900,00:00:03.100,What is a candle flame really made of?,0.0
00:00:03.600,00:00:07.080,I am at the Palace of Discovery in Paris to do an experiment,0.0
00:00:07.080,00:00:09.080,that beautifully demonstrates the answers.,0.5719
00:00:17.060,00:00:18.500,Ok so we're turning on an electric field here,0.296
00:00:18.500,00:00:20.580,and we see that the flame is spreading out.,0.0
00:00:35.540,00:00:36.380,"Thats very cute,",0.5095
00:00:36.380,00:00:37.500,it's like a butterfly.,0.3612
00:00:42.500,00:00:44.060,And you can see that the flame,0.0
00:00:44.060,00:00:47.180,has two separate pieces to it now.,0.0
00:00:47.180,00:00:49.260,One is going towards the negative plate.,-0.5719
00:00:49.260,00:00:50.720,"Those would be the positive ions,",0.5574
00:00:50.720,00:00:53.580,and the negative ions will be going towards a positively charged plate.,-0.2732
00:00:53.580,00:00:55.740,So we see the flame kinda flattening out.,0.0
00:00:55.740,00:00:57.080,But if that didn't convince you,-0.2755
00:00:57.100,00:00:58.700,"that flame contains ions,",0.0
00:00:58.700,00:01:00.480,then check part two of our experiment,0.0
00:01:00.480,00:01:02.080,where we compare the conductivity of a,0.0
00:01:02.080,00:01:03.940,"flame to the connectivity of air,",0.0
00:01:04.240,00:01:05.860,which is normally a pretty good insulator.,0.7269
00:01:06.380,00:01:07.740,"It requires about 10,000 volts",0.0
00:01:07.740,00:01:09.740,to break down a centimeter of air.,0.0
00:01:09.740,00:01:13.120,"So right now this plate is is about 20,000 V.",0.0
00:01:13.800,00:01:15.640,"You see that the spark is only little,",0.2263
00:01:18.120,00:01:19.660,"but if I put it around the flame,",0.0
00:01:19.660,00:01:21.820,we will see if we can get a bigger spark happen.,0.2263
00:01:23.420,00:01:25.780,"Look at that, yeaaa!",0.0
00:01:30.200,00:01:32.120,"Because the flame has those ions in it,",0.0
00:01:32.120,00:01:33.520,that means that we can break down,0.0
00:01:33.580,00:01:35.280,a greater distance of air.,0.3612
00:01:36.340,00:01:37.640,This greater conductivity.,0.3612
00:01:43.060,00:01:46.520,"It's awesome! You love doing this, right?",0.8622
00:01:46.520,00:01:48.260,A strong enough electric field,0.5106
00:01:48.260,00:01:50.280,can actually extinguish the flame,0.0
00:01:50.280,00:01:53.120,but watch carefully what happens  when the flame goes out.,0.1901
00:02:03.660,00:02:06.580,"Just like in the flame,  the opposite charges in the smoke",0.1027
00:02:06.580,00:02:08.580,are pulled in opposite directions.,0.0
00:02:08.580,00:02:11.280,Now while some may argue that a flame is not,-0.34
00:02:11.280,00:02:13.500,truly a plasma because it's not hot enough,0.4404
00:02:13.500,00:02:15.660,"and it doesn't have a high enough density of ions,",0.0
00:02:16.160,00:02:18.640,"one thing is for sure, it does contain ions",0.3182
00:02:18.640,00:02:20.700,"which have important electrical properties,",0.2023
00:02:20.700,00:02:23.560,which can be demonstrated if  you have a strong enough electric field.,0.5106
