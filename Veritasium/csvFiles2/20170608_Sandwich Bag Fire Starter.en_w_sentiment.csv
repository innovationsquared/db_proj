00:00:12.509,00:00:15.809,We're going to try to use a ziploc bag to start a fire,-0.34
00:00:15.809,00:00:18.659,G: I guess when you're building a fire the first thing you're going to need is some tinder,-0.34
00:00:18.660,00:00:22.180,So we're gonna have to go scavenge around for some options this stuff works pretty well,0.6486
00:00:22.180,00:00:23.070,D: now this is pretty dry,0.7297
00:00:23.070,00:00:26.939,"G: Yeah, we definitely want something that's off the ground if possible because we need it as dry as possible",0.6369
00:00:27.519,00:00:32.789,The first step was to grind up the tinder into a fine powder. I'm just following Grant's instructions here,0.2023
00:00:32.790,00:00:37.679,I'm not really sure if this is going to work see that right there. That's the stuff We're going for it's super fine,0.5456
00:00:37.680,00:00:43.439,"We're gonna take our base plate. We're going to pinch a nice little pile in there. okay, so at this point We're pretty much ready",0.8555
00:00:43.439,00:00:45.399,to start,0.0
00:00:45.399,00:00:46.899,the ignition process,0.0
00:00:46.899,00:00:50.218,So what do we need for that? ...for that We're going to need Ziplock bag and a little bit of water,0.0

00:01:02.260,00:01:04.199,We're going to be making a liquid magnifying glass,0.0
00:01:04.199,00:01:07.199,I do that by turning my ziploc bag you know 45 degrees,0.0
00:01:07.200,00:01:10.470,So it creates this diamond shape and then we're [just] going to gather these two Corners together,0.6284
00:01:10.470,00:01:12.390,We're going to lose a little bit of water as we do okay,-0.2023
00:01:12.390,00:01:16.650,I'm going to pinch that off and the next goal is to twist it trap all that water inside,-0.3182
00:01:17.259,00:01:21.539,You see as I twist it it creates pressure that exerts [-] almost an equal pressure on all sides,-0.2585
00:01:21.610,00:01:23.639,And now while it's not a perfect sphere,-0.4585
00:01:24.610,00:01:27.029,It will eventually start to bubble out,0.0
00:01:28.360,00:01:32.069,Into a nice liquid sphere where we need it we've essentially just made a makeshift magnifying glass,0.4215
00:01:32.140,00:01:34.799,And you start to fire the same way you would with a magnifying glass,-0.34
00:01:34.869,00:01:38.099,Now once he rolled the ball around you can see where it looks the best,0.6369
00:01:38.100,00:01:41.790,We're looking for as close to as sphere as possible. Which is right there now if I back it out,0.0

00:01:42.869,00:01:49.409,You can see there start smoking immediately that's incredible the focal length of the lens is the place where [all] of the light converges?,0.0

00:01:52.509,00:01:55.529,Position the tinder pile at the focal point of this,0.0
00:01:55.960,00:02:00.449,Spherical by convex lens [essentially] now you can see [that's] been smoking [for] a little while Mm-hmm,0.0
00:02:00.509,00:02:03.659,We've developed a little bit of an Ember base. It's burned a little bit,0.0
00:02:03.659,00:02:06.659,"Yeah, so now I'm going to sprinkle a little bit more fuel on top there",0.5046
00:02:07.030,00:02:11.929,And that will cause the heat to rise and burn that from the bottom and I'm going to again from the top nice,0.5574
00:02:12.629,00:02:18.859,It's interesting how you're like kind of bringing it down so that the surface of that is not actually where the most concentrated,0.6369

00:02:23.910,00:02:27.919,"We don't want the heat to [dissipate] too much, and if we're at an extreme focal point like this. Yes",0.6875
00:02:27.920,00:02:33.229,"The heats going to bleed off, so if we can warm the surrounding area it actually helps speed the process, right?",0.5423
00:02:33.330,00:02:36.380,We're just going to repeat that process until it will stay smoking on its own,0.0
00:02:36.380,00:02:39.679,[we've] only been at this for a minute or two and the amount of smoke,0.0
00:02:39.680,00:02:46.489,We're seeing there is it's pretty significant [a] little bit of sprinkle a little bit of sunlight rinse and repeat. We're really elevating the temperature,0.6124
00:02:48.239,00:02:50.040,Mm-Hmm I,0.0
00:02:50.040,00:02:52.340,Just point our pile smoking pretty well on its own now,0.6486
00:02:52.340,00:02:56.450,I'm going to go ahead and take this plastic bag and just set it to the side we could reuse this again if we wanted,0.0
00:02:56.450,00:03:01.789,To at this point. We can probably start adding smaller pieces of tinder. You'll get a few of these little pieces here,0.0

00:03:08.519,00:03:14.659,Sure to still allow the [oxygen] to get in there exactly because if you take away the oxygen you smother the fire cool,0.0772
00:03:14.660,00:03:17.149,I think right there. We're just going to let it sit for a [couple] minutes now,0.0
00:03:17.150,00:03:20.630,Well that's going we can start chopping up some of these pieces. We just found lying on the ground. They're dry,-0.3182

00:03:29.690,00:03:32.929,We need to transfer this without disturbing the coals as much as possible,0.4023
00:03:33.150,00:03:37.039,The way that I like to do that is take this base. Mm-hmm. We're going to take this grass,0.3612
00:03:37.040,00:03:39.980,We're going to put over top and we're just going to gently roll. It over like this,0.743

00:03:50.880,00:03:55.609,now because of all that straw the air can flow through it and help build the heat one trick that I use it look a,0.3612
