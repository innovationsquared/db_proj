00:00:16.309,00:00:20.160,ball when weighed against a beaker with a submerged ping pong ball.,0.0
00:00:20.160,00:00:23.940,"But what would happen if, instead of tethering the ping pong ball to the base of the beaker,",0.0
00:00:23.940,00:00:26.120,it was instead submerged by my finger.,0.0
00:00:26.120,00:00:31.070,I posed this question in the last video and you responded with thousands of comments.,0.0
00:00:31.070,00:00:34.450,Thirteen percent of you thought that the acrylic ball beaker would be heavier.,0.0
00:00:34.450,00:00:37.410,Twenty-nine percent thought the ping pong ball beaker would be heavier.,0.0
00:00:37.410,00:00:40.820,And 54 percent of you thought that they would be balanced.,0.0
00:00:40.820,00:00:53.660,"So now let’s see what actually happens in three, two, one.",0.0
00:00:53.660,00:00:55.280,Perfectly balanced.,0.6369
00:00:55.280,00:00:57.460,But why is this the case?,0.0
00:00:57.460,00:01:01.970,"Well, just as in the previous experiment, both balls displaced the same amount of water",0.2732
00:01:01.970,00:01:07.049,and so they experienced the same upward buoyant force equal to the weight of water they displace.,0.2263
00:01:07.049,00:01:12.380,"Therefore, there are equal and opposite downward forces on the water, making both beakers heavier",0.0

00:01:14.110,00:01:16.640,And our answer could stop here.,-0.296
00:01:16.640,00:01:20.299,"But if you are wondering why this result is different from the previous case, consider",0.0
00:01:20.299,00:01:24.109,"that in the first part, the downward force on the ping pong ball side was counteracted",0.0
00:01:24.109,00:01:26.689,by the upward tension in the string.,-0.3182
00:01:26.689,00:01:29.970,"But not any more, because there is no string.",-0.4215
00:01:29.970,00:01:34.869,"Instead, the downward force from my hand is equal to the buoyant force minus the weight",0.6249

00:01:36.329,00:01:39.070,So that overall both beakers get heavier by the same amount.,0.0
00:01:39.070,00:01:43.569,It is just the weight of water displaced by the ping pong ball or the acrylic ball because,0.0
00:01:43.569,00:01:45.189,it has the same volume.,0.0
00:01:45.189,00:01:48.439,I hope you enjoyed this experiment.,0.7351
