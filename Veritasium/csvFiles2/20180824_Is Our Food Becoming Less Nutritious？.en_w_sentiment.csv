00:00:12.460,00:00:16.500,"But is this really true, and should we be worried?",0.3269
00:00:16.560,00:00:21.800,"A study published in 2004 looked at 43 different common garden crops,",0.0

00:00:46.300,00:00:49.400,How well could we really have measured those nutrients back in 1950?,0.2732

00:01:02.260,00:01:06.540,"So if we're witnessing a nutrient collapse, what's causing it?",-0.4939
00:01:09.120,00:01:13.980,One factor that many people point to is depletion of the soils.,0.0

00:01:17.800,00:01:21.760,intense farming practices were thought to be the cause of nutrient depletion.,0.0772

00:01:28.100,00:01:31.700,"But, farmers have always put a lot of effort into maintaining their soils,",0.0
00:01:31.700,00:01:36.100,"and using fertilizers to ensure that the plants have all the nutrients they need,",0.3818
00:01:36.400,00:01:39.000,which makes that argument less convincing.,-0.024
00:01:39.400,00:01:45.480,"We're still getting big plants, and they wouldn't grow that well if they didn't have the nutrients they need in the soil.",-0.2057
00:01:49.440,00:01:52.249,So why else might nutrients be declining?,0.0
00:01:53.240,00:01:56.400,One possibility is that it's selective breeding.,0.0
00:01:56.400,00:02:03.200,"If you look at crops like corn today, they're barely recognizable when you compare them to their ancestors,",0.3612

00:02:22.860,00:02:24.900,But are they more nutritious?,0.0
00:02:25.200,00:02:32.080,Maybe we've accidentally been breeding the nutrition out of our foods in pursuit of other objectives.,-0.34
00:02:32.790,00:02:37.000,"It's tough to really assess how big of a factor selective breeding is,",-0.128
00:02:37.100,00:02:43.550,because we can't easily compare this produce to the same produce a hundred years ago or a thousand years ago.,-0.2584
00:02:43.550,00:02:50.990,So we need something else to be able to determine whether it's selective breeding causing this decrease or something else.,0.0
00:02:51.720,00:02:55.800,What would be really helpful would be a plant that has never been selectively bred.,0.4754

00:03:13.500,00:03:22.900,"And so, it has remained wild, or untouched by selective breeding, but how would you know what goldenrod was like 100 or 200 years ago?",0.5023
00:03:23.480,00:03:30.700,The Smithsonian Institute have been keeping hundreds of samples of goldenrod dating all the way back to 1842.,0.0

00:03:54.260,00:04:00.639,what else has contributed to goldenrod becoming less nutritious over the last 150 years or so?,0.0
00:04:01.100,00:04:07.300,One rather surprising idea was that carbon dioxide could play a vital role.,0.6908

00:04:35.200,00:04:36.700,"Now, that might not sound like a lot,",-0.2755
00:04:36.770,00:04:42.100,"but if you're thinking of it as plant food, we're talking about an increase by almost 50%,",0.4497
00:04:42.700,00:04:44.900,and we can see the impact from space.,0.0
00:04:45.080,00:04:47.679,It's called the greening of the planet.,0.0

00:05:21.479,00:05:28.600,scientists pumped carbon dioxide into rice crops to simulate the kind of CO2 concentrations expected in 50 years time.,0.0

00:05:36.240,00:05:42.979,But a lower concentration of nutrients doesn't necessarily correlate with a decline in the plant's nutrient contents.,-0.4215
00:05:43.500,00:05:45.500,It's called the dilution effect.,0.0
00:05:47.310,00:05:49.339,So what does all this mean for us?,0.0
00:05:49.560,00:05:54.949,"Well, by 2050 scientists estimate that up to a hundred and fifty million people in the developing world",0.2732

00:06:01.260,00:06:04.339,So does that mean we should all be taking vitamins and supplements?,0.0
00:06:05.220,00:06:07.300,"Well, no. At least, not yet.",0.2732
00:06:07.300,00:06:13.009,"Because the nutrient declines are small enough that you should still be able to get everything you need from a well balanced diet,",0.2732
