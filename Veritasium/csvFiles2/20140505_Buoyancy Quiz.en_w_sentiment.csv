00:00:10.468,00:00:12.800,So why does it sink in the detergent?,0.0
00:00:12.820,00:00:19.160,Because the golf ball is more heavy than the liquid that’s in the container— then the detergent.,0.0
00:00:19.420,00:00:26.820,What do you mean heavier ? Can you elaborate on that at all ? umm probably more dense ? Good. And if I put this in this is saltwater…,0.5724
00:00:27.180,00:00:29.560,"How salt is it ? It's very salty, huh ?",0.0
00:00:29.640,00:00:34.720,This is the  saltiest salt water you can make. Okay. And I think it’s saturated solution. What will it do?,0.4939
00:00:34.740,00:00:40.480,"I think it would be floating. Okay, lets have a look… ooh, oh",0.2263
00:00:40.720,00:00:45.899,"Excellent, so the golf ball floats in the salt water… And if you have a look it’s like it’s just is sticking out just a little bit.",0.7351
00:00:45.899,00:00:48.029,So what does that tell you about it?,0.0
00:00:53.110,00:00:57.149,It’s just slightly less dense right? Like it was a lot less dense to when it’s higher.,0.3041
00:00:57.149,00:01:03.299,"Yeah, the question is if we now take the detergent and we pour it in on top of the golf ball.",0.4588
00:01:03.879,00:01:08.789,What do you think will happen? Will the golf ball stay where it is ? Will it go down ? Or will it go up ?,0.0
00:01:08.790,00:01:10.790,I think it’ll go down a little bit.,0.0
00:01:11.110,00:01:14.339,"Yeah, why do you think that ? Well ? No let’s see.",0.3527

00:01:17.920,00:01:23.400,Maybe it'll go up. I have no idea. I think it will go down a little bit.,-0.296
00:01:23.460,00:01:26.790,Do you think this is going to mix with that ? Well that's what I was thinking about,0.2732
00:01:26.790,00:01:31.259,"I wonder if it’s gonna mix or if it’s gonna layer itself, and just, sort of sit on top here.",0.2023

00:01:36.729,00:01:41.399,So you can make your prediction by clicking on one of the on-screen annotations or you can click a link in the description.,0.0
00:01:42.420,00:01:47.380,"But make your prediction now. What do you think is Gonna happen to this golf ball ? Ready in three, two, one.",0.5023
