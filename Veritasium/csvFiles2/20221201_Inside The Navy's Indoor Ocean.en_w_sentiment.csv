00:02:25.740,00:02:28.230,about waves is they transmit energy,0.2732

00:02:45.630,00:02:48.213,This is known as the wave base.,0.0
00:02:49.350,00:02:51.570,"But even in an ideal water wave,",0.6808
00:02:51.570,00:02:53.580,the molecules do drift a bit,0.0

00:02:55.170,00:02:57.690,And this is because the molecules travel faster,0.0
00:02:57.690,00:02:59.130,the higher up they are.,0.0
00:02:59.130,00:03:01.740,So they move farther at the top of their loop,0.2023
00:03:01.740,00:03:03.960,"than they move backwards at the bottom,",0.0
00:03:03.960,00:03:06.930,creating a spiral path.,0.296
00:03:06.930,00:03:09.570,This place is perfect for observing properties,0.5719

00:03:20.310,00:03:21.720,"'Cause we're at .6, we'll go to .5,",0.0
00:03:21.720,00:03:23.220,so it'll be a two second wave.,0.0

00:03:36.990,00:03:38.760,the ones with higher frequency,0.0
00:03:38.760,00:03:40.830,look like they have a greater amplitude,0.6124
00:03:40.830,00:03:43.710,because the slope of the waves is steeper.,0.0
00:03:43.710,00:03:48.000,"And second, the frequency of a wave affects its speed.",0.0
00:03:48.000,00:03:51.960,High frequency waves travel slower than low frequency waves.,-0.2732
00:03:51.960,00:03:55.110,"In fact, as long as the water is deeper than the wave base,",0.0
00:03:55.110,00:03:58.293,wave speed is inversely proportional to its frequency.,0.0
00:03:59.430,00:04:01.050,They have a really cool demo,0.3804
00:04:01.050,00:04:02.880,that takes advantage of the different speeds,0.25

00:04:04.740,00:04:06.960,You can see it starting here.,0.0
00:04:06.960,00:04:09.240,They send out high frequency waves first,0.0
00:04:09.240,00:04:13.110,followed by lower and lower frequency waves.,-0.5267
00:04:13.110,00:04:15.930,"And because the high frequency waves travel slower,",0.0
00:04:15.930,00:04:18.663,the lower frequency waves gradually catch up.,-0.296
00:04:19.536,00:04:20.369,Whoa.,0.0
00:04:23.220,00:04:25.860,And they've timed it so that all the waves meet up,0.0
00:04:25.860,00:04:28.557,"at exactly the same time and place in the pool,",0.0
00:04:28.557,00:04:31.560,and this causes the wave to break.,0.0
00:04:31.560,00:04:34.060,The ocean engineers can do this again,0.0
00:04:35.760,00:04:37.263,"and again,",0.0

00:04:40.290,00:04:43.323,thanks to their precise control over the waves.,0.4404
00:04:44.160,00:04:45.990,This demo also nicely illustrates,0.4404
00:04:45.990,00:04:47.580,"the principle of superposition,",0.0
00:04:47.580,00:04:50.340,that when waves meet they add together.,0.0
00:04:50.340,00:04:53.220,The height of the water is equal to the sum of the heights,0.0
00:04:53.220,00:04:56.550,of the individual waves meeting at that point.,0.0
00:04:56.550,00:04:59.160,You can see how much bigger the amplitude is.,0.0
00:04:59.160,00:05:01.590,"Those individual waves weren't that big,",0.0
00:05:01.590,00:05:03.300,"but when you add them all together,",0.0
00:05:03.300,00:05:05.523,you can make this big breaking wave.,0.0
00:05:07.230,00:05:09.720,They can also take advantage of the superposition principle,0.25
00:05:09.720,00:05:11.820,to create standing waves.,0.2732
00:05:11.820,00:05:13.680,- So what's coming up next are two regular waves,0.0
00:05:13.680,00:05:15.180,coming at each other.,0.0
00:05:15.180,00:05:16.590,What we call the quilt wave.,0.0
00:05:16.590,00:05:18.030,So we're gonna have a wave coming this way,0.0
00:05:18.030,00:05:19.350,"and a wave going this way,",0.0
00:05:19.350,00:05:21.030,and it's gonna create standing waves.,0.2732
00:05:21.030,00:05:22.620,So there's two regular waves coming out,0.0
00:05:22.620,00:05:23.940,"and if you look at the wave,",0.0
00:05:23.940,00:05:26.850,it looks like a big quilt pattern out there.,0.3612
00:05:26.850,00:05:28.200,"- At some places in the pool,",0.0
00:05:28.200,00:05:31.500,"the waves always cancel out to zero amplitude,",-0.25
00:05:31.500,00:05:35.313,and at other places the waves add up for maximum amplitude.,0.0

00:05:38.880,00:05:41.310,so they form circular wave fronts,0.0
00:05:41.310,00:05:44.550,and then all the wave energy is channeled into one spot,0.2732
00:05:44.550,00:05:45.783,they call the bullseye.,0.0
00:05:47.400,00:05:49.080,- And so now we're gonna run the bullseye wave,0.0

00:05:50.430,00:05:52.530,"but instead of having a line of waves,",0.0
00:05:52.530,00:05:55.920,we're having it all coalesce at one individual point.,0.0
00:05:55.920,00:05:57.180,So you can start seeing the waves are,0.0

00:05:59.100,00:06:01.260,and you can see they're making a spherical wave.,0.0
00:06:01.260,00:06:02.670,And then you have another spherical wave,0.0
