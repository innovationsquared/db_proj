00:03:45.280,00:03:51.280,in 1874 Georg Cantor a german mathematician&nbsp; published a paper that launched a new branch,0.128

00:04:30.240,00:04:37.040,he wondered are there more natural numbers&nbsp; or more real numbers between zero and one,0.4201
00:04:38.000,00:04:43.040,the answer might seem obvious there are&nbsp; an infinite number of each so both sets,0.0772
00:04:43.040,00:04:49.200,should be the same size but to check this logic&nbsp; canter imagined writing down an infinite list,0.0

00:04:54.800,00:05:00.480,now since each real number is an infinite decimal&nbsp; there is no first one so we can just write them,-0.2263
00:05:00.480,00:05:06.240,down in any random order the key is to make sure&nbsp; we get them all with no duplicates and line them,-0.296

00:05:26.880,00:05:34.480,identifier for each real number on the list now&nbsp; Cantor says start writing down a new real number,0.1531
00:05:34.480,00:05:40.160,and the way we're going to do it is by taking the&nbsp; first digit of the first number and adding one,0.0772

00:08:34.000,00:08:39.600,and most other mathematicians agreed with him no&nbsp; one shall expel us from the paradise that Cantor,0.5667
00:08:39.600,00:08:46.880,has created Hilbert declared but in 1901 Bertrand&nbsp; Russell pointed out a serious problem in Cantor's,-0.5423

00:09:58.480,00:10:03.520,but the barber can't shave himself because the&nbsp; barber doesn't shave anyone who shaves themselves,0.0
00:10:03.520,00:10:10.240,so the barber must shave himself if and only if&nbsp; he doesn't shave himself it's a contradiction,-0.25
00:10:11.360,00:10:15.920,the intuitionists rejoiced at Russell's&nbsp; paradox thinking it had proven set theory,0.3818

00:10:20.800,00:10:26.560,solved the problem by restricting the concept of&nbsp; a set so the collection of all sets for example is,-0.4939

00:15:06.720,00:15:12.320,was impossible the only person who paid much&nbsp; attention was John von Neumann one of Hilbert's,0.0
00:15:12.320,00:15:17.840,former students who pulled G√∂del aside to ask a&nbsp; few questions but the next year G√∂del published,0.0
00:15:17.840,00:15:25.840,a proof of his incompleteness theorem and this&nbsp; time everyone including Hilbert took notice,0.0
00:15:29.040,00:15:35.680,this is how G√∂del's proof works G√∂del&nbsp; wanted to use logic and mathematics,0.0
00:15:35.680,00:15:43.360,to answer questions about the very system&nbsp; of logic and mathematics and so he took,0.0
00:15:43.360,00:15:49.840,all these basic symbols of a mathematical&nbsp; system and then he gave each one a number,0.0772
00:15:51.120,00:15:57.760,this is known as the symbol's G√∂del number&nbsp; so the symbol for not gets the number one,-0.0572
00:15:58.640,00:16:05.760,or has the G√∂del number two if then it's G√∂del&nbsp; number three now if you're expressing all of these,0.1531
00:16:05.760,00:16:11.760,symbols with numbers then what do you do about&nbsp; the numbers themselves well zero gets its own,0.2732
00:16:11.760,00:16:18.400,G√∂del number six and if you want to write a one&nbsp; you just put this successor symbol next to it the,0.4069
00:16:18.400,00:16:25.760,immediate successor of zero is 1. and if you&nbsp; want to write 2 then you have to write ss0,0.296
00:16:26.560,00:16:30.640,and that represents 2 and so on so you could&nbsp; represent any positive integer this way,0.5574
00:16:31.440,00:16:35.840,granted it is cumbersome but it works&nbsp; and that is the point of this system,0.128
00:16:36.560,00:16:42.080,so now that we have G√∂del numbers for all of&nbsp; the basic symbols and all of the numbers we might,0.0
00:16:42.080,00:16:50.000,want to use we can start to write equations&nbsp; like we could write zero equals zero so these,0.4215
00:16:50.000,00:16:59.360,symbols have the G√∂del numbers six five six and&nbsp; we can actually create a new card that represents,0.2732
00:16:59.360,00:17:07.120,this equation zero equals zero and the way we&nbsp; do it is we take the prime numbers starting at 2,0.0
00:17:07.120,00:17:14.000,and we raise each one to the power of the G√∂del&nbsp; number of the symbol in our equation so we have,0.0772
00:17:14.000,00:17:21.200,2 to the power of 6 times 3 to the power of 5&nbsp; times 5 to the power of 6 equals 243 million,0.0
00:17:21.920,00:17:29.200,so 243 million is the G√∂del number&nbsp; of the whole equation zero equals,0.0
00:17:29.200,00:17:36.000,zero we can write down G√∂del numbers for&nbsp; any set of symbols that you can imagine,0.0
00:17:36.000,00:17:42.880,so really this is an infinite deck of cards where&nbsp; any set of symbols that you want to write down,0.0772
00:17:42.880,00:17:48.400,in a sequence you can represent with a unique&nbsp; G√∂del number and the beauty of this G√∂del,0.6249
00:17:48.400,00:17:55.280,number is you can do a prime factorization of it&nbsp; and you can work out exactly what symbols made up,0.0772
00:17:55.840,00:18:01.200,this card so in this whole pack of cards&nbsp; there are going to be true statements,0.4215
00:18:01.200,00:18:07.520,and there are going to be false statements so how&nbsp; do you prove that something is true well you need,0.5994
00:18:07.520,00:18:14.720,to go to the axioms the axioms also have their own&nbsp; G√∂del numbers which are formed in the same way,0.0
00:18:15.360,00:18:24.480,so here's an axiom which says not the successor of&nbsp; any number x equals zero which makes sense because,-0.0941
00:18:24.480,00:18:29.920,in this system there are no negative numbers and&nbsp; so the successor of any number cannot be zero,0.668
00:18:30.480,00:18:38.400,so we can put down this axiom and then we can&nbsp; substitute in zero for x saying that one does not,0.0
00:18:38.400,00:18:46.000,equal zero and we've created a proof this is the&nbsp; simplest proof i can think of that shows that one,0.25
00:18:46.000,00:18:54.160,does not equal zero now this card for the proof of&nbsp; one does not equal zero gets its own G√∂del number,0.0772
00:18:54.160,00:18:59.120,and the way we calculate this G√∂del number&nbsp; is just as before we take the prime numbers,0.0
00:18:59.120,00:19:08.640,and we raise 2 to the power of the axiom times&nbsp; 3 to the power of 1 does not equal 0 and we get,0.0
00:19:08.640,00:19:14.560,a tremendously large number it would have 73&nbsp; million digits if you calculated it all out so,0.1477
00:19:14.560,00:19:22.160,i've just left it here in exponential notation as&nbsp; you can see these numbers get very large and so,0.0
00:19:22.160,00:19:27.120,you might want to start just calling them by&nbsp; letters so we could say this one is G√∂del,0.0772
00:19:27.120,00:19:35.520,number a this is G√∂del number b G√∂del number&nbsp; c and so on G√∂del goes to all this trouble to find,-0.3664
00:19:36.160,00:19:45.360,this card which says there is no proof for the&nbsp; statement with G√∂del number g the trick is,-0.2732
00:19:46.400,00:19:53.280,that the G√∂del number of this card is&nbsp; g so what this statement is really saying,0.0772
00:19:53.280,00:20:00.400,is this card is unprovable there is no proof&nbsp; anywhere in our infinite deck for this card,-0.296
00:20:01.200,00:20:04.400,now think about it if it's&nbsp; false and there is a proof,0.0
00:20:05.040,00:20:12.080,then what you have just proven is there is&nbsp; no proof so you're stuck with a contradiction,-0.6682
00:20:14.320,00:20:20.800,that would mean the mathematical system is&nbsp; inconsistent the other alternative is that,0.0
00:20:20.800,00:20:26.000,this card is true there is no proof for the&nbsp; statement with G√∂del number g but that means,0.1154
00:20:26.720,00:20:33.360,this mathematical system has true statements&nbsp; in it that have no proof so your mathematical,0.1531
00:20:33.360,00:20:40.480,system is incomplete and that is G√∂del's&nbsp; incompleteness theorem this is how he shows,0.0
00:20:40.480,00:20:47.600,that any basic mathematical system that can do&nbsp; fundamental arithmetic will always have statements,0.0
00:20:47.600,00:20:55.840,within it which are true but which have no proof&nbsp; there's a line in the tv show the office that,-0.2263
00:20:55.840,00:21:01.280,echoes the self-referential paradox of G√∂del's&nbsp; proof jim is my enemy but it turns out the jim,-0.3506
00:21:01.280,00:21:07.760,is also his own worst enemy and the enemy of my&nbsp; enemy is my friend so jim is actually my friend,-0.8481
00:21:09.840,00:21:13.040,but because he is his own worst enemy the enemy,-0.9528
00:21:13.040,00:21:17.920,of my friend is my enemy so&nbsp; actually jim is my enemy but,-0.34
00:21:22.800,00:21:28.480,G√∂del's incompleteness theorem means that&nbsp; truth and provability are not at all the same,0.3182
00:21:28.480,00:21:34.240,thing Hilbert was wrong there will always be true&nbsp; statements about mathematics that just cannot,-0.4767
00:21:34.240,00:21:39.760,be proven now Hilbert could console himself with&nbsp; the hope that at least we could still prove maths,0.4404
00:21:39.760,00:21:44.960,consistent that is free of contradictions&nbsp; but then G√∂del published his second,0.2846
00:21:44.960,00:21:49.680,incompleteness theorem in which he showed&nbsp; that any consistent formal system of math,0.0
00:21:49.680,00:21:56.800,cannot prove its own consistency so taken together&nbsp; G√∂del's two incompleteness theorems say that the,0.0
00:21:56.800,00:22:03.040,best you can hope for is a consistent yet&nbsp; incomplete system of math but a system like,0.7783
00:22:03.040,00:22:08.720,that cannot prove its own consistency so some&nbsp; contradiction could always crop up in the future,-0.3134
00:22:08.720,00:22:13.760,revealing that the system you'd been working with&nbsp; had been inconsistent the whole time and that,0.0
00:22:13.760,00:22:19.920,leaves only the third and final big question from&nbsp; Hilbert is mathematics decidable that is is there,0.0

00:22:51.520,00:22:57.760,could reason through its operation so he came up&nbsp; with a machine that takes as input an infinitely,0.0

00:23:19.600,00:23:25.440,to completion the program consists of a set of&nbsp; internal instructions you can think of it like,0.3612
00:23:25.440,00:23:30.880,a flow chart that tells the machine what to do&nbsp; based on the digit it reads and its internal state,0.0
00:23:32.480,00:23:37.200,you could imagine exporting these instructions to&nbsp; any other Turing machine which would then perform,0.0

00:23:58.480,00:24:04.080,that's what made the Turing machine so useful in&nbsp; answering Hilbert's question on decidability when,0.5777
00:24:04.080,00:24:10.160,a touring machine halts the program has finished&nbsp; running and the tape is the output but sometimes a,0.0
00:24:10.160,00:24:16.400,touring machine never halts maybe it gets stuck in&nbsp; an infinite loop is it possible to tell beforehand,-0.25
00:24:16.400,00:24:22.400,if a program will halt or not on a particular&nbsp; input Turing realized this halting problem,-0.4019
00:24:22.400,00:24:26.960,was very similar to the decidability problem if&nbsp; he could find a way to figure out if a Turing,-0.4019
00:24:26.960,00:24:32.560,machine would halt then it would also be possible&nbsp; to decide if a statement followed from the axioms,0.0
00:24:33.280,00:24:37.920,for example you could solve the twin prime&nbsp; conjecture by writing a Turing machine program,0.2023
00:24:37.920,00:24:42.480,that starts with the axioms and constructs&nbsp; all theorems that can be produced in one step,0.0
00:24:42.480,00:24:47.360,using the rules of inference then it constructs&nbsp; all theorems that can be produced in one step,0.0
00:24:47.360,00:24:52.800,from those and so on each time it generates a&nbsp; new theorem it checks if it's the twin prime,0.0
00:24:52.800,00:25:00.080,conjecture and if it is it halts if not it never&nbsp; halts so if you could solve the halting problem,-0.2263
00:25:00.080,00:25:04.480,you could solve the twin prime conjecture&nbsp; and all sorts of other unsolved questions,0.2023
00:25:05.280,00:25:10.400,so Turing said let's assume we can make a&nbsp; machine h that can determine whether any,0.0
00:25:10.400,00:25:16.720,Turing machine will halt or not on a particular&nbsp; input you insert the program and its input,0.0
00:25:16.720,00:25:24.240,and h simulates what will happen printing out&nbsp; either halts or never halts for now we don't worry,0.3412
00:25:24.240,00:25:30.800,about how h works we just know that it always&nbsp; works it always gives you the right answer now,0.0
00:25:30.800,00:25:37.360,we can modify the h machine by adding additional&nbsp; components one if it receives the output halts,0.0
00:25:37.360,00:25:44.400,immediately goes into an infinite loop another if&nbsp; it receives never holds then it immediately halts,0.0
00:25:45.200,00:25:53.440,we can call this entire new machine h plus and&nbsp; we can export the program for that entire machine,0.0
00:25:54.800,00:26:01.440,now what happens if we give this machine&nbsp; its own code both as program and input,0.0
00:26:02.160,00:26:09.600,well now h is simulating what h plus&nbsp; would do given its own input essentially h,0.2732
00:26:09.600,00:26:16.240,has to determine the behavior of a machine&nbsp; that it itself is a part of in this exact,0.0
00:26:16.240,00:26:25.600,circumstance if h concludes that h plus never&nbsp; halts well this makes h plus immediately halt,0.2732
00:26:28.640,00:26:37.840,if h thinks h plus will halt well then&nbsp; that necessarily forces h plus to loop,0.2732
00:26:38.960,00:26:46.400,whatever output the halting machine h gives it&nbsp; turns out to be wrong there's a contradiction,-0.6249
00:26:47.120,00:26:53.680,the only explanation can be that a machine like&nbsp; h can't exist there's no way to tell in general,0.2235
00:26:53.680,00:27:02.400,if a touring machine will halt or not on a given&nbsp; input and this means mathematics is undecidable,0.0
00:27:02.400,00:27:08.160,there is no algorithm that can always determine&nbsp; whether a statement is derivable from the axioms,-0.296
00:27:08.160,00:27:13.600,so something like the twin prime conjecture&nbsp; might be unsolvable we might never know,0.4173
00:27:14.320,00:27:20.880,whether there are infinite twin primes or not&nbsp; the problem of undecidability even crops up,-0.4019

00:27:49.040,00:27:54.240,while gapped systems cannot they don't have&nbsp; the energy needed to overcome the spectral gap,-0.2057
