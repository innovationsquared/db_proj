00:03:31.920,00:03:34.400,So a lot of people will look at this and conclude,0.0
00:03:34.400,00:03:38.000,the electron carried the energy from the battery to the bulb,0.2732

00:04:11.360,00:04:13.920,So although it is the electron that transfers energy,0.2732

00:05:06.080,00:05:09.840,So mobile electrons cannot push each other through the wire.,0.0
00:05:10.560,00:05:13.120,So where does the electric field come from?,0.0
00:05:13.760,00:05:15.920,Misconception number three is that it comes,0.0772
