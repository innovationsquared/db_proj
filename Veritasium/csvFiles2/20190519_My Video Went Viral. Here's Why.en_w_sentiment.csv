00:00:45.400,00:00:51.480,I think it's worth understanding that there may be sort of a common factor at play amongst all of them.,0.5106
00:00:51.480,00:00:57.040,So what I'm actually gonna present is a kind of theory of everything when it comes to YouTube;,0.0

00:01:01.320,00:01:04.600,why do videos go viral on the platform right now.,0.0
00:01:04.600,00:01:09.160,"Okay, so, you know, I think as a viewer your response to burnout might be to say,",0.2263

00:01:19.200,00:01:21.120,"so why should we care about this YouTuber thing,",0.4939
00:01:21.120,00:01:25.280,but I think that YouTuber burnout is a more specific phenomenon;,0.0
00:01:25.280,00:01:28.200,I think there's something particular going on here.,0.0
00:01:28.200,00:01:32.560,and it all starts with the YouTuber life cycle.,0.0

00:01:50.080,00:01:54.200,so maybe you work a little bit harder but things don't really change,0.0

00:01:57.240,00:02:00.840,I think there's a certain thing to do with the psychology of anchoring here.,0.2732
00:02:00.840,00:02:04.000,"You know, once you have a certain number of subscribers,",0.34
00:02:04.000,00:02:07.720,"then, you know, a hundred thousand views which might be amazing in the beginning",0.5859
00:02:07.720,00:02:10.080,feels like a horrible disappointment.,-0.6486
00:02:10.080,00:02:14.600,"So there's a real problem between sort of expectations and reality,",-0.4019

00:02:36.000,00:02:41.600,"okay, so this idea we assume that views reflect something about video quality,",0.2263
00:02:41.600,00:02:43.520,"we kind of make that assumption,",0.0
00:02:43.520,00:02:48.120,"and so when there are, you know, fewer views taking place,",0.0
00:02:48.120,00:02:49.960,that means the video is lower quality.,-0.296

00:02:52.572,00:02:54.400,but I want to question that.,0.1154
00:02:54.400,00:02:58.120,I also want to question these YouTubers who essentially put the blame on themselves,-0.2732
00:02:58.120,00:03:02.000,"and say, you know, they're just not making as good videos anymore",-0.3412
00:03:02.000,00:03:05.000,"to me I think there's something else at play,",0.34
00:03:05.000,00:03:07.800,and it is the system.,0.0
00:03:07.920,00:03:10.860,"So, from time to time, I like to go over to Google Trends,",0.3612

00:03:38.800,00:03:40.800,"So this is how much people are searching for me,",0.0
00:03:40.800,00:03:45.720,"which I think kind of correlates to how much my videos are being shown on YouTube,",0.0
00:03:45.720,00:03:47.840,and how much people are watching them and enjoying them.,0.5267
00:03:47.840,00:03:54.080,Now let's look at a similar channel for comparison. How about the channel Numberphile?,0.0

00:03:56.040,00:03:59.720,"but it's, uh, you know, very diff- made by very different people",0.0

00:04:07.760,00:04:11.000,So this is the AsapSCIENCE curve.,0.0
00:04:11.720,00:04:17.600,"So here you have Veritasium, Numberphile, and AsapSCIENCE: three educational YouTube channels,",0.0
00:04:17.600,00:04:22.480,which all follow a fairly similar pattern on Google Trends.,0.0
00:04:23.280,00:04:28.920,"So my question is: You know, why is this? Why should we follow a similar trend?",0.0
00:04:28.920,00:04:31.760,"Well, the obvious answer is the algorithm.",0.2732
00:04:32.840,00:04:35.160,"And the algorithm has a very important job,",0.2716
00:04:35.160,00:04:39.480,"because in traditional media, there are not that many works produced.",0.0

00:05:19.320,00:05:26.760,"And yet, YouTube claims that they have this algorithm, which you can think of, like, the brain of the platform",0.3612

00:05:50.680,00:05:54.560,and the audience itself is always kind of shifting,0.0
00:05:54.560,00:05:58.000,"and changing who they are and what they like to watch,",0.3612
00:05:58.000,00:06:01.960,"and so, the algorithm, you can think of as following the audience",0.0
00:06:01.960,00:06:07.280,the algorithm is-is chasing this audience around and trying to reach them.,0.0258
00:06:07.280,00:06:10.520,"Now, what YouTube doesn't much consider, is that",0.0
00:06:10.520,00:06:17.360,"well, the YouTube creators use their content to try to chase the algorithm.",0.2732
00:06:17.360,00:06:20.240,"So these YouTubers who would love to be creating content about,",0.7506

00:06:29.000,00:06:33.800,"And so there's a way in which the content is chasing the algorithm, the algorithm is chasing the audience,",0.0
00:06:33.800,00:06:37.720,"and if the content actually manages to catch up with the algorithm,",0.0
00:06:37.720,00:06:40.800,"you get a-a kind of perverse situation,",-0.4754

00:08:07.960,00:08:12.440,"but they quickly figured out that, of course, like, a 20 minute view is worth a lot more than a 5 second view,",0.6808
00:08:12.440,00:08:15.520,so the actual metric should be watch time.,0.0

00:08:18.400,00:08:21.640,because people like to watch people play video games for long periods of time.,0.5994
00:08:21.640,00:08:23.680,"They also reduced the latency of the algorithm,",0.0

00:09:37.360,00:09:41.880,"Uh, there was this famous experiment where, you know, pigeons were put in a cage with a lever",0.0

00:10:03.280,00:10:07.920,"Well, they started to do the types of behaviors that they were doing when the food appeared,",0.2732

00:10:16.360,00:10:20.960,"so, the point being they started to engage in these superstitious behaviors,",0.34

00:10:43.040,00:10:45.520,now I can understand why the algorithm has to change.,0.0
00:10:45.520,00:10:51.000,"I mean in the early days of YouTube, it was this situation where if you had subscribers you were golden",0.0
00:10:51.000,00:10:53.560,because the next time you uploaded some content,0.0
00:10:53.560,00:10:56.680,then YouTube would show it to all your subscribers it'll get a ton of views,0.0
00:10:56.680,00:11:01.400,"YouTube would say ""oh this is a popular video"", show it to even more people, getting you even more subscribers",0.4215
00:11:01.400,00:11:05.880,so the next time you launch another video then it goes to more subscribers more views,0.0
00:11:05.880,00:11:09.640,and it was just this positive feedback loop where you would grow and grow and grow a channel,0.6428
00:11:09.640,00:11:13.040,so the rich got richer and small channels stayed small,0.8062
00:11:13.040,00:11:15.640,so obviously we needed something to break the cycle,0.0
00:11:15.640,00:11:18.760,and so YouTube started doing some experiments,0.0
00:11:18.760,00:11:24.440,where they would essentially change what was recommended to your audience,0.2023
00:11:24.440,00:11:28.520,so they would stop showing some of the content from certain subscribers,-0.0935
00:11:28.520,00:11:30.920,and they saw what happened to views,0.0
00:11:30.920,00:11:35.440,so they started disconnecting these subscribers from the channel,0.0
00:11:35.440,00:11:39.200,"No longer was a subscription like ""I want to see every video by this person""",0.1531
00:11:39.200,00:11:45.880,it was more of a suggestion that maybe something this person creates is something I might like to see,0.5574
00:11:45.880,00:11:48.200,and what YouTube found when they did that,0.0
00:11:48.200,00:11:54.040,was that the number of views on the platform the amount of watch time all rose dramatically,0.0772
00:11:54.040,00:12:01.440,so for YouTube to get growth of the site they found that reducing the importance of subscriptions was essential,0.6249
00:12:01.440,00:12:03.160,and this kind of makes sense if you think about it,0.0
00:12:03.160,00:12:05.200,"I mean if you make one great video,",0.6249
00:12:05.200,00:12:08.880,that doesn't necessarily mean that every video you're gonna make is gonna be great,0.6249
00:12:08.880,00:12:10.760,so it makes sense for YouTube to step in,0.0
00:12:10.760,00:12:16.200,and play some role in terms of determining what gets shown to which audience members,0.34
00:12:16.200,00:12:20.320,"Now, as has been observed by MatPat previously,",0.0
00:12:20.320,00:12:27.040,moving away from subscriptions moves YouTube back to what it was like to sell newspapers on the street,0.3612
00:12:27.040,00:12:30.400,you really had to inspire people to buy on the spot,0.6077
00:12:30.400,00:12:35.160,you have to serve up really sensational news items. This is also called yellow journalism.,0.0
00:12:35.160,00:12:38.520,it was only once the newspapers built subscription models,0.0
00:12:38.520,00:12:44.880,"that newspapers could make sober journalism a reality, something that they focused on",0.3818
00:12:44.880,00:12:48.920,"because they already had your eyeballs, they didn't have to fight for that sort of attention",0.2924
00:12:48.920,00:12:51.120,they didn't have to be as sensational,0.0
00:12:51.120,00:12:54.040,but YouTube is going in the opposite direction,0.0
00:12:54.680,00:13:00.240,reducing the importance of subscribers means increasing the importance of sensationalism,0.6124
00:13:00.240,00:13:02.400,and click-baity thumbnails,0.0
00:13:02.400,00:13:06.680,and so a few weeks ago I was out at the creator summit in New York,0.0
00:13:06.680,00:13:08.240,and I met MrBeast.,0.0
00:13:08.240,00:13:13.200,I showed him some of the footage from this video I was working on about the shade balls in LA Reservoir,0.0
00:13:13.200,00:13:16.800,"and MrBeast took one look at it, and he said to me",0.0
00:13:19.200,00:13:20.290,that's a banger,0.0
00:13:21.240,00:13:26.360,which I think it's pretty funny but I think clearly he knew that this was going to be a video that would take off,0.765
00:13:26.360,00:13:28.880,and we talked about titles and thumbnails,0.0
00:13:28.880,00:13:35.600,you might have noticed that the thumbnail borrows a bit from say his work with cereal and Orbeez in backyards,0.0
00:13:35.600,00:13:39.160,"and I told him that I was thinking about calling it something like,",0.3612

00:13:41.800,00:13:43.560,"and he was like, ""No"".",0.3612
00:13:44.160,00:13:48.960,"He suggested, why are there 96 million black balls on this lake",0.0
00:13:49.600,00:13:54.360,Now I changed it to reservoir because I mean let's be real that's what it is,0.0
00:13:54.360,00:13:58.320,but it just goes to show how important the title and thumbnail are,0.296
00:13:58.320,00:14:05.120,what I learned talking to MrBeast was that going viral you can boil down to two metrics:,0.0
00:14:05.120,00:14:08.360,you need to do two things with your video in order for it to go viral,0.0
00:14:08.360,00:14:11.720,and I mean tens of millions of views as his channel shows,0.0
00:14:11.720,00:14:15.360,"Okay the first thing, maybe not surprising, is watch time.",0.0222
00:14:15.360,00:14:19.880,so when people click on your video they actually have to watch a significant portion of it,0.2023
00:14:19.880,00:14:22.360,It's useful if that's sort of seven or eight minutes,0.4404
00:14:22.360,00:14:26.080,"now that is the actual time that they watch, so you need a longer video than that,",0.0
00:14:26.080,00:14:31.040,"say 15 minutes, if you want the average watch time to be around that 7 or 8 minute mark",0.0772
00:14:31.040,00:14:35.760,"Now for me, watch time is not that exciting of a metric to know that I have to hit",-0.3875
00:14:35.760,00:14:39.800,because I know that most people already watch most of my videos,0.0
00:14:39.800,00:14:42.480,so for me the big insight came with number two,0.0772
00:14:42.480,00:14:46.560,if you want a viral video you need to have a high click-through rate,0.0772
00:14:46.560,00:14:50.560,so that is the total number of clicks on your titles and thumbnails,0.1513
00:14:50.560,00:14:54.960,divided by the number of times that title and thumbnail have been shown,0.0772
00:14:54.960,00:14:56.360,that is your click-through rate,0.0
00:14:56.360,00:15:03.440,and MrBeast showed me this graph showing that as you approach 10% 20% 30% click-through rate,0.0
00:15:03.440,00:15:07.080,then the number of views and the number of impressions that video will get,0.3612
00:15:07.080,00:15:09.960,Just skyrockets. It jumps dramatically,0.0
00:15:10.640,00:15:12.600,now on the one hand that kind of makes sense,0.4939
00:15:12.600,00:15:16.600,because you know people are clicking a video obviously you're going to get more views,0.0
00:15:16.600,00:15:19.760,but it is such a dramatic increase,0.4497
00:15:19.760,00:15:26.200,that it really turns the site into a place where the title and thumbnail are everything,0.0
00:15:26.200,00:15:30.520,you can have a great video but unless you have a great hook to get people in,0.8481
00:15:30.520,00:15:31.800,it's not going to go viral,0.0
00:15:32.400,00:15:35.480,and so it was amazing to hear all these different YouTubers,0.6204
00:15:35.480,00:15:37.720,talk about how they optimized a thumbnail,0.4588
00:15:37.720,00:15:41.040,many people told me that when they were working on a thumbnail for a new video,0.0
00:15:41.040,00:15:46.880,they would actually Photoshop it onto a screenshot of their current YouTube home screen,0.0
00:15:46.880,00:15:50.440,in various positions and just see how eye catching it was,0.0
00:15:50.440,00:15:56.200,they're really working hard to make these thumbnails as clickable as possible,-0.1725
00:15:56.200,00:15:58.320,it's like weaponizing the thumbnail,0.3612
00:15:58.320,00:16:04.040,and that arms race is only set to increase with the introduction of real-time click-through rate,0.3182
00:16:04.040,00:16:06.440,which is coming out in a month or two,0.0
00:16:06.440,00:16:08.120,so what you can bet will happen,0.0
00:16:08.120,00:16:13.400,is that creators will launch a video and then they'll be sitting there with all these different variants of thumbnails,0.0
00:16:13.400,00:16:17.720,and they'll be swapping them out and looking at what that does to click-through rate,0.0
00:16:17.720,00:16:22.040,and then going with the one that leads to the greatest click-through rate,0.6369
00:16:22.560,00:16:26.360,"and you can imagine, if you don't do this, you're gonna be left behind",0.0
00:16:26.360,00:16:30.520,because all the other creators are sitting there swapping their thumbnails,0.0
00:16:30.520,00:16:34.080,to get the highest engagement that they possibly can on their videos,0.4588
00:16:34.080,00:16:38.160,"and if you're not doing that, then your videos will end up getting buried",0.0
00:16:38.960,00:16:43.440,"So, acknowledging that this is the reality of YouTube",0.0
00:16:43.440,00:16:47.560,I want to outline to you my plan for what I will do going forward,0.0772
00:16:47.560,00:16:50.960,"First and foremost, I want to keep making high-quality videos",0.0772
00:16:50.960,00:16:53.480,because if I don't do that I'm not going to be happy,0.5719
00:16:53.480,00:16:55.720,I won't be satisfied and neither will you,-0.3252
00:16:55.720,00:17:01.000,but second of all I'm gonna have to choose topics that are more clickable,0.0
00:17:01.000,00:17:06.880,because frankly if I'm going to work for days and weeks and months on a video,0.0
00:17:06.880,00:17:12.240,I would like that video to get say 10 million views instead of half a million,0.3612
00:17:12.240,00:17:16.600,"so a lot of that comes down to ""is this topic clickable""",0.0
00:17:16.600,00:17:21.960,and so or number three I'm gonna have to use some clickbaity titles and thumbnails,0.1477
00:17:21.960,00:17:24.560,and I apologize for that,0.1027
00:17:24.560,00:17:27.360,but it just seems like it's an existential threat,-0.3291
00:17:27.360,00:17:30.520,that if you don't do that your channel will not be around for very long,0.0
00:17:30.520,00:17:33.320,and you'll be on that sort of downward slide,0.0
00:17:33.320,00:17:36.200,"I'd love to know what you think, If you think it's a good idea a bad idea",0.5574

00:18:25.480,00:18:29.200,but on the other hand I challenge you to think of a better way,0.8625
00:18:29.200,00:18:36.240,because they have this limited real estate in which to show people potential videos they might be interested in,0.1469
00:18:36.240,00:18:41.160,and of course they want to put the videos there that people are most likely to click,0.0772

00:18:47.120,00:18:51.600,would you make the argument that you should put some videos there that people are less likely to click?,-0.3612
