00:01:05.480,00:01:09.160,"So you don't know, you don't hear about many helicopters at a hundred thousand.",0.0
00:01:09.160,00:01:11.280,I think forty thousand feet is probably the record.,0.0
00:01:11.280,00:01:16.320,- I checked. Forty thousand feet is the record altitude reached by helicopters on Earth.,0.1027
00:01:16.320,00:01:19.720,"85,000 feet is the highest a plane has ever flown.",0.0

00:01:23.520,00:01:26.560,- Right. In terms of density is 1% of what you have in this room.,0.0
00:01:26.560,00:01:30.560,"So in this room, a cubic meter of air is about a kilogram.",0.0
00:01:30.560,00:01:35.680,- Yeah - The same cubic meter on Mars will be about 15 grams to 18 grams.,0.296
00:01:35.680,00:01:36.680,So that much,0.0
00:01:36.680,00:01:38.520,- So you have to push a lot of air down.,0.0
00:01:38.520,00:01:40.440,- Yes. You gotta get a lot of air flowing.,0.4019
00:01:40.440,00:01:45.400,"And so the obvious trick, if you will, is to spin the blades faster.",-0.1189

00:02:01.040,00:02:05.360,So the Mars helicopter will have to spin its blades five times faster.,0.0
00:02:05.360,00:02:11.320,"- But there are some limits you know, you really don't want to get the tips of the blades breaking the speed of sound,",-0.1902
00:02:11.320,00:02:13.040,- cause then you have shockwaves and all sorts of,0.0
00:02:13.040,00:02:18.760,"- and you get all kinds of funky aerodynamics and you know the transonic flows and things like that, so you don't want to go there.",0.1567
00:02:18.760,00:02:23.560,"So we, in our designs, keep the tip Mach numbers down to below about 0.7.",0.0
00:02:23.560,00:02:25.040,- So 70% the speed sound.,0.0
00:02:25.040,00:02:26.360,- Yeah. It was very conservative.,0.296
00:02:26.360,00:02:32.080,- One advantage of flying on Mars is that gravity is only 38% of what it is on Earth.,0.25
00:02:32.080,00:02:35.320,"Even so, making the craft lightweight was essential.",0.0
00:02:35.320,00:02:40.560,- Keeping the mass of this vehicle contained during the entire design process has been the major challenge.,0.1513

00:02:44.000,00:02:46.840,The entire vehicle is less than 1.8 kilograms,0.0

00:02:58.040,00:02:59.600,"- Yes, it's quite light. Yes.",0.6887
00:03:01.120,00:03:04.400,- 35 grams is the mass of six quarters.,0.0
00:03:04.400,00:03:15.280,Think about that: two 35 gram blades lifting an 1800 gram helicopter by spinning 40 times per second in just 1% of Earth's atmosphere.,0.0

00:03:30.840,00:03:32.440,"Like, that's a long time!",0.4199
00:03:32.440,00:03:33.120,- That is. Yeah.,0.296
00:03:33.120,00:03:37.520,"- One of the questions I had was, why didn't they use a quadcopter design?",0.0
00:03:37.520,00:03:43.600,"Well, because on Mars, the blades have to be so long that the whole craft would barely fit on the rover.",0.5118
00:03:43.600,00:03:47.560,Two counter-rotating propellers provide the simplest design.,0.0
00:03:47.560,00:03:52.200,They also generate lift more efficiently when stacked on top of each other.,0.5849
00:03:52.200,00:03:58.280,- The bottom rotor sees the sort of the more compactified flow.,0.0
00:03:58.280,00:04:02.800,"The top one pulls it, the bottom one sees sort of a more concentrated flow.",0.2023
00:04:02.800,00:04:06.040,So the bottom rotor actually can do better than if they were separated apart.,0.4404
00:04:06.040,00:04:10.760,- But how do you test a helicopter designed for conditions on Mars on Earth?,0.0
00:04:10.760,00:04:16.560,What would happen if you just took your Mars helicopter and you tried to take off on Earth?,0.0
00:04:16.560,00:04:17.960,- It would just make a lot of noise.,0.0
00:04:17.960,00:04:18.520,- Really?,0.0
00:04:18.520,00:04:20.440,- And it probably wouldn't get the full head speed either...,0.0
00:04:20.440,00:04:22.240,- because of how much atmosphere we've got.,0.0
00:04:22.240,00:04:23.920,"- Exactly, it's like trying to swim in a thick soup.",0.3612
00:04:23.920,00:04:28.040,We have a really amazing chamber here on lab called the 25-foot space simulator.,0.624
00:04:28.040,00:04:31.520,And in that chamber you could simulate any kind of atmosphere you want.,0.0772
00:04:31.520,00:04:34.360,"You can go to Martian pressures, you can stay at Earth pressures, whatever you want.",-0.5106
00:04:34.360,00:04:38.240,"But that only took care of half of the problem, that was the aerodynamics aspect of it.",0.1901
00:04:38.240,00:04:40.200,There's the other part which is the gravity.,0.0
00:04:40.200,00:04:43.600,"We needed a way to fake Mars' gravity here on Earth,",-0.4767
00:04:43.600,00:04:46.760,and the best way that we could figure out to do that was a gravity offload.,0.6369
00:04:46.760,00:04:50.040,"- Gravity offload just means pulling up on the helicopter,",0.0
00:04:50.040,00:04:55.080,so it only has to support about 38% of its weight just like it will have to do on Mars.,0.6369
00:04:55.080,00:04:57.200,"- And effectively it was a high-tech fishing reel,",0.4404
00:04:57.200,00:05:01.080,"so taking a brushed DC motor, a reaction torque sensor, and a pulley,",0.0
00:05:01.080,00:05:03.240,mounting that a couple stories in the air,0.0
00:05:03.240,00:05:06.360,and then attaching a fishing string to the top of the helicopter,0.2023
00:05:06.360,00:05:10.880,that would tug the necessary force required to offload the differences in gravity.,0.0
00:05:10.880,00:05:12.120,- An actual fishing line?,0.0
00:05:12.120,00:05:13.200,"- Yeah, real fishing line.",0.296
00:05:13.200,00:05:14.600,"- But isn't that stretchy,",0.0
00:05:14.600,00:05:18.880,like don't you want something that's perfectly rigid so as soon as you apply the torque it gets applied to the craft?,0.7165
00:05:18.880,00:05:23.960,"- Right right, and we did a lot of testing with different vendors to find out which fishing line had the best spring constant for us.",0.6369
00:05:24.680,00:05:26.920,- What does the helicopter sound like?,0.3612
00:05:26.920,00:05:32.040,"I imagined that in 1% of Earth's atmosphere, the helicopter would be pretty quiet.",0.4939
00:05:32.040,00:05:35.200,"- Yeah you're still at 1%, but it's still, real loud.",0.1531
00:05:35.200,00:05:35.760,- Really?,0.0
00:05:35.760,00:05:37.520,- Yeah we have audio recordings of it too.,0.296
00:05:37.520,00:05:42.460,"But it's it's, I would characterize it more like a 'baaaaaaaaah', something like that.",0.7869
00:05:43.120,00:05:46.440,(baaaaaaah),0.0
00:05:46.560,00:05:51.640,"When gravity offload systems working and the chamber was pumped down, the helicopter thought it was on Mars.",0.0
00:05:51.640,00:05:53.960,It felt like it was on Mars.,0.3612
00:05:53.960,00:05:57.840,- How do you actually steer this thing around and drive it?,0.0
00:05:57.840,00:06:03.040,- So the way helicopters work is they have something called collective and cyclic.,0.0
00:06:03.040,00:06:06.960,So what collectives do is they change the pitch on the blades uniformly.,0.0
00:06:06.960,00:06:09.640,"So throughout the entire revolution you will move the collective,",0.0
00:06:09.640,00:06:13.800,"the blades will change, you can change your angle of attack, you'll get more lift",-0.4767
00:06:13.800,00:06:16.280,"so that's basically what you would provides you height control,",0.0
00:06:16.280,00:06:20.040,"Right? You pitch more you go up, pitch less you come down.",0.0
00:06:20.040,00:06:23.320,"But then, there's something called a cyclic on helicopters,",0.0
00:06:23.320,00:06:29.040,"which basically what it does is it modulates the pitch as it goes around,",0.0
00:06:29.040,00:06:34.200,"so it can pitch it a little bit more here, less here, so it kind of like modulates.",0.2975
00:06:34.200,00:06:37.640,"So what that does is it provides an asymmetric torque, right?",0.0
00:06:37.640,00:06:40.040,When you're pitched up there you get that additional torque.,0.0
00:06:40.040,00:06:46.960,"Now you get it, depending upon the stiffness the system you actually get it with that a gyroscopic lag that can happen afterwards.",-0.34
00:06:46.960,00:06:54.200,"So once you get an asymmetric torque, the vehicle wants to start pitching or rolling. Right?",0.0
00:06:54.200,00:06:56.600,"So once it pitches and rolls,",0.0
00:06:56.600,00:06:58.400,you're doing it stably.,0.0
00:06:58.400,00:07:05.480,You are now pointed in a direction and your thrust vector now has a component that's horizontal in the direction that you pitched. Right?,0.0
00:07:05.480,00:07:07.680,So then you start translating in that direction.,0.0
00:07:07.680,00:07:12.240,- I've heard that initially someone tried to fly it with a joystick?,0.1779
00:07:12.240,00:07:13.600,- Yes. - Was it an early prototype?,0.4019
00:07:13.600,00:07:16.880,"- If you were sitting right there on Mars and you were trying to joystick it, what is it like?",0.4939
00:07:16.880,00:07:19.040,And it's almost unflyable.,0.0
00:07:19.040,00:07:24.760,And the reason for that it's the aerodynamics of when you want to command a roll to the left,0.0772
00:07:24.760,00:07:28.640,because you see yourself starting to move to the right and you start commanding a roll to the left.,0.0
00:07:28.640,00:07:30.160,There's a delay aspect.,-0.3182
00:07:30.160,00:07:34.840,So that that delay effect makes it very very difficult for a human to try and pilot it.,-0.6844
00:07:34.840,00:07:37.240,- You can't fly this from Earth...,0.0
00:07:37.240,00:07:42.760,"- because of the twenty-minute kind of time delay, so you have to really send sequences.",-0.3182
00:07:42.760,00:07:45.200,"- So essentially you're gonna push a button,",0.0
00:07:45.200,00:07:49.280,and like 20 minutes later it'll take off and do its thing and then you will find out.,0.3612

00:08:33.000,00:08:38.400,"So when you see video tapes of our ""successful flights"", right!",0.6239
