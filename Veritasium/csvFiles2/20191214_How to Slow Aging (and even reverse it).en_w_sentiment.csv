00:00:18.340,00:00:19.860,And I made a Twitter poll,0.0
00:00:19.860,00:00:24.180,where I found that the majority of people were supportive and thought there should be more of it,0.296
00:00:24.180,00:00:27.300,but there were some important concerns and I want to address those here,0.3919
00:00:27.300,00:00:30.420,at the beginning. I mean the most significant concern was:,0.2716
00:00:30.420,00:00:32.500,"if we're looking to extend human lifespan,",0.1779
00:00:32.500,00:00:34.620,does that just mean we'll have more,0.0

00:01:04.820,00:01:08.060,"I mean, if you really are tackling aging,",0.0
00:01:08.060,00:01:13.780,then you should also see that those age-related diseases do not set in so quickly.,0.0
00:01:13.780,00:01:18.240,"So, the point of slowing aging and extending human lifespan",0.0
00:01:18.240,00:01:23.680,"is to extend the healthy lifespan, also called the health span.",0.5267
00:01:23.680,00:01:26.580,The other concerns I saw were that people were saying:,0.0
00:01:26.580,00:01:29.940,"""Well, this could be used only for the wealthy and increase inequality""",0.7096

00:01:47.280,00:01:52.940,can we slow aging in humans? Can we extend the lifespan and the health span?,0.264
00:01:52.940,00:01:55.800,And what does that look like? How do we do it?,0.4329
00:01:55.800,00:02:00.140,"Okay. So for this video I traveled up to the 'Bodega Marine Lab',",0.2263
00:02:00.140,00:02:05.740,which is north of San Francisco and there I got to see some 'moon jellyfish'.,0.0
00:02:05.740,00:02:10.780,Now what's fascinating about these 'moon jellyfishes' is that some people consider them immortal.,0.6705
00:02:11.080,00:02:12.400,How can that be?,0.0
00:02:12.440,00:02:15.660,So all these jellyfish have this complex life cycle,0.0
00:02:15.760,00:02:18.340,"where they start off as a polyp,",0.0
00:02:18.340,00:02:22.020,which is basically like a small sea anemone and then they'll go through a metamorphosis,0.3612
00:02:22.100,00:02:27.100,and become a medusa. And the medusa stage is what we generally think of when we think about a jellyfish.,0.0
00:02:27.100,00:02:33.800,"And in most of these species the polyps are generally able to asexually reproduce,",0.0
00:02:33.840,00:02:38.600,"and they can regenerate if tissue is cut off of them or if they're damaged,",-0.6124
00:02:38.660,00:02:44.560,"and they don't have any clear evidence of senescence, which is the term for biological aging.",-0.2924
00:02:44.960,00:02:47.800,So they appear to have some degree of immortality.,0.0
00:02:47.820,00:02:52.860,No one had reported their ability to do this until... I think this was 2015.,0.0258
00:02:52.880,00:02:58.260,So do 'moon jellyfish' hold the key to slowing aging and extending our lifespan?,0.0
00:02:58.260,00:03:00.400,Could they help us live forever?,0.4019
00:03:00.400,00:03:07.200,"Before I got into making this video, I would have put this sort of research in the same category as",0.0

00:03:16.500,00:03:19.260,"Because we don't even understand how the brain works or how memories are stored,",0.0

00:03:22.460,00:03:28.180,"I would have put, say, extending the human lifespan to 120, 150, and beyond in the same category,",0.0

00:03:33.920,00:03:38.080,I think it seems much more possible and in fact plausible,0.0
00:03:38.080,00:03:42.600,that we'll make some progress over controlling aging in our lifetimes.,0.4215
00:03:42.600,00:03:47.720,"Now, if you want to slow aging, the first question you need to answer is:",0.0772
00:03:47.720,00:03:52.000,"Why do we age in the first place? I mean, what really is aging?",0.0
00:03:52.120,00:03:54.840,I've made a video in the past about telomeres.,0.0
00:03:54.840,00:04:01.780,These are the end caps on your chromosomes. And every time a cell divides the telomere gets a bit shorter.,0.0
00:04:01.780,00:04:03.600,So it was thought that these,0.0
00:04:03.620,00:04:08.960,telomeres are kind of like the tips of your shoelaces and they prevent the chromosome from fraying.,0.3197
00:04:08.960,00:04:14.480,But there are other signs in older bodies that you have old cells.,0.0
00:04:14.480,00:04:17.620,"There are an accumulation of things, they're called senescent cells.",0.0
00:04:17.620,00:04:24.120,They're essentially these zombie-like cells that just go on living in your body and inflaming the cells around them.,0.0
00:04:24.120,00:04:28.020,"There's poor intercellular communication,",-0.4767
00:04:28.020,00:04:31.420,"there's mitochondrial dysfunction, those are the powerhouses of the cell.",-0.4215
00:04:31.440,00:04:38.760,There are these 8 or 9 different features of older cells and they are the hallmarks of aging.,0.0
00:04:38.800,00:04:42.220,"But the question is: are they the cause of aging,",0.0
00:04:42.260,00:04:46.560,or are they kind of the result of a deeper root cause?,0.0
00:04:46.580,00:04:50.980,"In the middle of the last century, the hypothesis was that",0.0
00:04:50.980,00:04:55.820,"it was damage to our DNA, mutations to our DNA that happened over  the course of our lives",-0.4939
00:04:55.860,00:04:58.280,that led us to be older,0.0
00:04:58.500,00:04:59.360,"But,",0.0
00:04:59.820,00:05:03.720,evidence since then has suggested that that is not really the case.,0.0
00:05:03.720,00:05:06.800,"I mean, you can take an adult cell,",0.0
00:05:06.800,00:05:11.260,and you can clone it into a new organism.,0.0
00:05:11.340,00:05:17.860,And that organism appears to live about as long as non-cloned organisms of the same species.,0.0
00:05:17.860,00:05:22.360,"Now, the first sheep, Dolly the sheep, had a short lifespan. She died early.",-0.5574
00:05:22.360,00:05:25.060,"But cloned animals; you can now clone a monkey,",0.0
00:05:25.100,00:05:29.920,"you can clone dogs, in fact Barbra Streisand, the actress, she cloned her dogs,",0.0
00:05:29.920,00:05:32.320,and they are expected to live a normal lifespan.,0.0
00:05:32.320,00:05:36.780,So in that way it seems like all the information is still there in the DNA.,0.3612
00:05:36.780,00:05:43.220,So if we're not losing information in our DNA then what is the reason for aging?,0.2924
00:05:43.220,00:05:47.040,"Well, professor Sinclair suspects that it's a loss of information,",-0.3818
00:05:47.040,00:05:51.360,"but not the information in our DNA, in our genome.",0.0
00:05:51.420,00:05:57.680,"No, professor Sinclair suspects that the loss of information is in our epigenome.",-0.5719
00:05:57.960,00:06:00.280,So what is the epigenome?,0.0
00:06:00.340,00:06:04.580,"Every cell in your body has the same DNA,",0.0
00:06:04.900,00:06:08.760,"but, different cell types have different epigenomes.",0.0
00:06:08.760,00:06:11.740,"They have different ways of packaging that DNA,",0.0
00:06:11.820,00:06:15.360,"coiling up, you know, a lot of it so that it's not read,",0.0
00:06:15.360,00:06:18.240,"and leaving some parts of the DNA spooled out,",0.0
00:06:18.240,00:06:23.220,so it's easier to transcribe and turn into proteins and run that cell.,0.4728
00:06:23.220,00:06:25.780,So the epigenome is responsible for,0.3182
00:06:25.800,00:06:30.040,turning on or turning off different parts of the DNA.,0.0
00:06:30.140,00:06:33.500,The way it does that is with proteins called 'histones',0.0
00:06:33.500,00:06:37.040,"that, essentially, the DNA is wrapped on,",0.0
00:06:37.040,00:06:39.360,and also things like methylation.,0.3612
00:06:39.360,00:06:44.940,So there's these chemical signaling markers which are placed on the DNA in certain positions.,0.2732
00:06:44.940,00:06:52.700,"So the idea is: when your body is first forming, the epigenome is what tells your cells what type of cell to be.",0.0

00:06:54.780,00:06:59.900,professor Sinclair's hypothesis is that we are losing information in the epigenome.,-0.3818
00:06:59.960,00:07:02.080,And that's important because if a skin cell,0.2023
00:07:02.080,00:07:05.880,"needs to remain a skin cell, that's the epigenome.",0.0
00:07:06.060,00:07:08.220,And if you don't have the epigenome,0.0
00:07:08.220,00:07:12.140,"the skin cell will forget what type of cell it is and it might turn into a brain cell,",-0.2263
00:07:12.140,00:07:15.260,which may not be that bad but if your brain turns into a skin cell,0.2323
00:07:15.260,00:07:18.500,you've got a problem and I think that's largely what aging is.,-0.4019
