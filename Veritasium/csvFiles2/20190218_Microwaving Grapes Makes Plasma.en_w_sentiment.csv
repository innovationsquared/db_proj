00:00:09.660,00:00:14.340,grape and cut it almost completely in half and put it in the microwave you can,-0.2732

00:00:21.200,00:00:25.380,but the explanation we had in that video was lacking this was,0.0
00:00:25.380,00:00:28.980,me and my friend Dr. Stephen Bosi a fellow physicist so you should look,0.4939
00:00:28.980,00:00:33.059,forward to that on another episode of veritasium to be honest nobody really,0.5106
00:00:33.059,00:00:39.390,knew how this effect worked that is until now as of the publication of this,0.0

00:00:47.010,00:00:51.449,cameras thermal cameras electromagnetic modeling and they came up with an,0.0
00:00:51.449,00:00:54.989,explanation that I think is pretty satisfying and it extends way beyond,0.7717
00:00:54.989,00:01:00.539,just microwave great plasma so naturally I called up these scientists yeah,0.743
00:01:00.539,00:01:05.519,actually saw your video before that your videos before joining the grape project,0.0
00:01:05.519,00:01:08.310,oh really that's why I was like already kind of,0.3612
00:01:08.310,00:01:12.000,like interested before joining the project the scientists showed you don't,0.6369
00:01:12.000,00:01:16.710,even need to use a grape you can get the same effect with hydrogel water beads,0.0
00:01:16.710,00:01:20.490,these are those tiny polymer beads which when you soak in water they increase in,0.3182
00:01:20.490,00:01:24.140,volume like 100 times,0.3612
00:01:28.620,00:01:33.820,to understand how microwaving a grape gives you plasma we first need to know a,0.0
00:01:33.820,00:01:38.530,few things like a typical household microwave uses a frequency of,0.3612
00:01:38.530,00:01:43.570,electromagnetic radiation at about two point four five gigahertz that means,0.0
00:01:43.570,00:01:49.509,that the wavelength of microwaves inside the oven is about twelve centimeters,0.0
00:01:49.509,00:01:53.050,long. now if you've ever studied electromagnetic radiation you might have,0.0
00:01:53.050,00:01:57.490,the intuition that interesting things start to happen when the object or,0.4019
00:01:57.490,00:02:03.039,obstacle is around the same size as the wavelength which a grape certainly is not,-0.0258
00:02:03.039,00:02:08.679,it's not twelve centimeters but the important quantity is how big is the,0.296
00:02:08.679,00:02:14.890,wavelength inside the object inside the grape twelve centimeters in air but the,0.0
00:02:14.890,00:02:19.180,like index of refraction of grape material must be close to like one point,0.6124
00:02:19.180,00:02:23.170,three three or something right like at visible wavelengths it is a lot lower,0.0772
00:02:23.170,00:02:28.810,but in the microwave regime the index of refraction is a almost 10 so you have a,0.0
00:02:28.810,00:02:33.250,much higher index of refraction so microwaves are traveling you know like,0.3612
00:02:33.250,00:02:37.299,ten times slower through the grape than they are through yet air yes and that,0.4019
00:02:37.299,00:02:41.530,means that the wavelength is a tenth its size through air so instead of twelve,0.0
00:02:41.530,00:02:47.950,centimeters it's about 1.2 centimeters right about the size of a grape now if,0.0
00:02:47.950,00:02:52.000,you take a single grape and place it inside the microwave don't cut it in,0.2057
00:02:52.000,00:02:56.110,half what you find is that the microwaves actually become trapped,-0.5267
00:02:56.110,00:03:01.060,inside the grape and that's because of its high refractive index and its size,0.0
00:03:01.060,00:03:05.680,because turns out that when you have like a ball where approximately the,0.3612
00:03:05.680,00:03:10.420,diameter is roughly the same as the wavelength of the microwaves in the material. It,0.0
00:03:10.420,00:03:14.799,actually turns out that it can be trapped in there so that it interacts its kind...,0.0
00:03:14.799,00:03:19.930,it's kind of it bounces at the borders of the of the ball and it can't get out,0.0
00:03:19.930,00:03:25.540,is it like total internal reflection? yes pretty much wow that's interesting I,0.9345
00:03:25.540,00:03:29.140,hadn't thought of it that way so the microwaves become trapped inside,-0.5267
00:03:29.140,00:03:33.820,the grape and they actually form these resonant modes you can think of them as,0.0
00:03:33.820,00:03:37.660,standing waves just ways in which the electromagnetic fields like to,0.3612
00:03:37.660,00:03:42.130,oscillate inside a grape such that the maximum electromagnetic field is,0.0
00:03:42.130,00:03:46.360,actually in the center of the grape when you put in the microwave you see that it,0.0
00:03:46.360,00:03:50.170,heats up not from the outside in like you would expect if it was just,0.3612
00:03:50.170,00:03:54.670,absorbing the microwaves but rather from the inside out. if you add a second grape,0.0
00:03:54.670,00:03:57.940,to the microwave you see that the same thing happens the microwaves get trapped,-0.5267
00:03:57.940,00:04:01.780,in the second grape too- and the amplitude is highest in the very center of the,0.0
00:04:01.780,00:04:07.450,grape and so the heating occurs most of all of there. but if you move these two,0.0
00:04:07.450,00:04:12.340,grapes close together so they're closer than say a wavelength well then you can,0.2732
00:04:12.340,00:04:15.700,start to get interactions between the electromagnetic fields in the one grape,0.0
00:04:15.700,00:04:20.290,and in the other and in fact if you get the grapes touching then the greatest,0.6369
00:04:20.290,00:04:25.600,electromagnetic field actually occurs at that contact point between the two,0.0
00:04:25.600,00:04:30.070,grapes and so that is where you're gonna get the greatest oscillating,0.6369
00:04:30.070,00:04:35.010,electromagnetic fields and that is where those grapes are going to get hottest,0.0
00:04:35.010,00:04:39.580,it's also interesting that you don't need to cut the grapes in half. two,0.5445
00:04:39.580,00:04:44.500,grapes placed side-by-side will make this effect work as long as they stay in,0.0
00:04:44.500,00:04:49.240,contact. but that's why in a lot of the videos you see there's a watch glass so,0.0
00:04:49.240,00:04:52.540,the reason the watch glass is there is to keep the grapes together now,0.0
00:04:52.540,00:04:55.780,with the very strong electromagnetic fields at the intersection of the two,0.5563
00:04:55.780,00:05:01.300,grapes what you can get is some sparks some breakdown of air that is the,0.0
00:05:01.300,00:05:05.020,electric fields are strong enough that they ionize the air creating those,0.6705
00:05:05.020,00:05:10.240,Sparks and that is what leads to the plasma it creates these ions which can,0.2732
00:05:10.240,00:05:16.090,then receive more energy from the microwaves. you can see it here pulsing,0.3384
00:05:16.090,00:05:21.940,at 120 Hertz that's twice the 60 Hertz frequency of mains power which reflects,0.0
00:05:21.940,00:05:26.140,the fact that the amplitude of the microwaves is pulsing twice every cycle,0.0
00:05:26.140,00:05:33.070,and what is that plasma made of? well the scientists looked at the spectrum of the,0.2732
00:05:33.070,00:05:37.600,plasma from a grape and they found that there's a strong potassium emission line,0.5106
00:05:37.600,00:05:43.420,and also a sodium emission line so it seems like those ions must be pretty,0.7152
00:05:43.420,00:05:46.660,common in the grape and when the plasma gets formed as those ions which are,0.0
00:05:46.660,00:05:50.620,sprayed up into the air and that is what we're seeing,0.0
00:05:50.620,00:05:55.600,who needs drugs?! now the size of the grapes is important which is something I,0.2714
00:05:55.600,00:05:58.900,of course suspected because you don't see this happening with too many other,-0.2263
00:05:58.900,00:06:05.290,squishy fruits but you don't have to get them the exact right size and this is,0.0
00:06:05.290,00:06:11.860,because water absorbs microwaves so the scientists did some modeling of this and,0.0
00:06:11.860,00:06:17.139,if you had a material inside the grape that did not absorb microwaves then what,0.0
00:06:17.139,00:06:22.630,you would see is at certain particular sizes you get extreme amplification of,0.2732
00:06:22.630,00:06:26.350,the electromagnetic fields it's basically one size that you'd have to,0.0
00:06:26.350,00:06:31.960,hit to get the amplification but made of an absorbent material like water this,0.5023
00:06:31.960,00:06:36.190,broadens out the peaks so you get less amplification of the field but over a,0.0
00:06:36.190,00:06:41.050,broader range of sizes this is why a lot of grapes will work even if the sizes,0.0
00:06:41.050,00:06:46.870,vary. so in terms of like applications of this research what do you think I mean,0.3612
00:06:46.870,00:06:52.780,obviously people like me are excited and because this is a fun trick but but,0.5423
00:06:52.780,00:06:56.440,beyond that what do you think in terms of like applications of this? the main,0.3612
00:06:56.440,00:07:01.300,limit in fabricating microchips right now and going smaller and smaller is the,0.0
00:07:01.300,00:07:06.130,lithography so how to make these very small features. this phenomenon shows,0.0
00:07:06.130,00:07:09.940,that two spheres of the right size and refractive index can focus,0.0
00:07:09.940,00:07:15.039,electromagnetic energy down to a tiny spot in between them in this case down,0.2732
00:07:15.039,00:07:20.050,to around a millimeter from radiation with a 12 centimeter wave length if,0.0
00:07:20.050,00:07:23.889,similar focusing could be achieved with light it would provide a significant,0.2023
00:07:23.889,00:07:29.289,improvement over current lithography techniques. So if we could somehow harness,0.4588
00:07:29.289,00:07:33.070,this to do this lithography to be able to maybe write things very small you,0.0
00:07:33.070,00:07:37.150,could actually use light to to make really small features you could do like,0.3612
00:07:37.150,00:07:41.979,every two nanometers marks spot with about 2 nanometers resolution - it would help,0.4019
00:07:41.979,00:07:46.630,help continue this like Moore's Law yes it would help continue Moore's Law like,0.9022
00:07:46.630,00:07:54.099,putting much more small things in a single chip so I'm glad I was finally able to,0.507
00:07:54.099,00:07:59.289,explain how this effect works did you enjoy it do you feel like you get it any,0.6908
