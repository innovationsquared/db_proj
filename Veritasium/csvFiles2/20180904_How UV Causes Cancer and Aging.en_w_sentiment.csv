00:00:00.030,00:00:04.640,Recently I made a video about what the world looks like in the ultraviolet,0.3612
00:00:04.640,00:00:08.480,Some things look the same but generally it's hazier,0.0
00:00:08.480,00:00:10.920,sometimes light and dark are flipped,0.0
00:00:10.920,00:00:15.340,skin looks blotchier and fake teeth stand out,-0.4767
00:00:15.340,00:00:16.370,Whoa!,0.0
00:00:17.180,00:00:18.880,Smile for me,0.3612
00:00:18.880,00:00:20.080,Oh my goodness,0.4588
00:00:20.080,00:00:22.080,Are my teeth black?,0.0
00:00:25.360,00:00:27.680,Do you have a fake tooth baby?,-0.4767
00:00:27.680,00:00:28.920,--Yes --Which one?,0.4019
00:00:30.200,00:00:34.520,"but the idea for this video started a long time ago with a question I had which is,",0.0
00:00:34.520,00:00:38.260,How does non ionizing radiation like ultraviolet light,0.3612
00:00:38.260,00:00:41.080,like ultraviolet light damage skin and lead to cancer?,-0.7269
00:00:41.080,00:00:44.240,"I do like to tell people that if you want to see how good your skin could look,",0.6908
00:00:44.240,00:00:45.340,look at your butt,0.0
00:00:45.340,00:00:47.380,because that's an area that doesn't get sun,0.0
00:00:47.380,00:00:49.700,and even old people have perfect butts,0.5719
00:00:49.700,00:00:52.560,it's how your skin would age without the sun,0.0
00:00:52.560,00:00:56.840,"when I thought about what UV light must be doing to our cells and our DNA,",0.0
00:00:56.840,00:01:01.440,I imagined it would be getting in there and breaking all these bonds and that would be the problem,-0.4019
00:01:01.440,00:01:03.800,but in fact it's kinda the opposite,0.0
00:01:03.800,00:01:10.340,UV actually facilitates the formation of covalent bonds in our DNA that shouldn't be there.,0.0
00:01:10.340,00:01:15.020,It comes in and it kind of creates these unauthorized bonds between the bases,0.204
00:01:15.020,00:01:16.820,called pyrimidine dimers,0.0
00:01:16.820,00:01:20.440,instead of having them bonded across it bonds the one next to each other,0.0
00:01:20.440,00:01:21.980,if that makes sense. -- Oh. -- Yeah.,0.296
00:01:21.980,00:01:25.140,"so what happens is two thymines, which are side be side,",0.0
00:01:25.140,00:01:27.820,can actually get covalently bonded together,0.0
00:01:27.820,00:01:31.600,and that creates a lesion on the DNA you can think of it like a little bump,0.5574
00:01:31.600,00:01:34.540,that makes the DNA hard to read and work with,-0.1027
00:01:34.540,00:01:39.060,That's not enough in itself to cause skin cancer. If that were the case we would just be covered in skin cancers,-0.6597
00:01:39.060,00:01:41.820,then the next step is that we have to repair it,0.0
00:01:41.820,00:01:43.360,"and in the repair,",0.0
00:01:43.360,00:01:48.320,that's when you form mutations that could eventually lead to cancer through a bunch of different pathways,-0.6597
00:01:48.320,00:01:51.220,and there's actually people who have specific,0.0
00:01:51.220,00:01:56.700,genetic issues that they can't repair these issues and they are covered in skin cancer,-0.6597
00:01:56.700,00:01:59.080,UV has other effects on the body like,0.3612
00:01:59.080,00:02:03.520,"suppresses the immune system so, as Haley says, it's a ""double whammy""",0.296
00:02:03.520,00:02:09.000,There's also kind of a double whammy because UV not only induces these unauthorized bonds,0.0
00:02:09.000,00:02:12.660,it actually tamps down our natural immune system,0.5719
00:02:12.660,00:02:15.980,so one of the best ways we fight cancer is through our immune system,-0.1531
00:02:15.980,00:02:18.580,we have constantly need surveillance through our skin,0.0
00:02:18.580,00:02:21.340,"so not only is sunlight creating these problems,",-0.128
00:02:21.340,00:02:24.900,It's actually reducing our ability to fix them.,0.3182
00:02:24.900,00:02:25.920,So unfair,-0.5256
00:02:25.920,00:02:31.400,UV light also causes us to visibly age. It's called photo-aging,0.0
00:02:31.400,00:02:37.280,"I should clear up a misconception here that I had which was, I thought glass blocks all ultra-violet light.",0.1779
00:02:37.280,00:02:41.840,"so I thought if you're inside a car, for example, you really don't need to put on sunscreen because,",0.0
00:02:41.840,00:02:43.560,you're not being exposed to UV light,0.0572
00:02:43.560,00:02:45.840,The car does not block UVA. It's glass,0.3412
00:02:45.840,00:02:48.040,It does block most UVB,-0.4404
00:02:48.040,00:02:52.560,but you're still susceptible to those sunspots and those wrinkles through the glass,0.0
00:02:52.560,00:02:55.540,"and a lot of my patients if you look and you compare their hands,",0.0
00:02:55.540,00:03:01.000,the left is is more wrinkled or has more sunspots on it because they're driving.,0.0
00:03:01.000,00:03:06.140,So they're sticking that hand... --Sticking that hand out their truckers. Absolutely you can see it the worst,0.3182
00:03:06.140,00:03:09.900,And there's a really famous picture of someone whose left side of their face,0.0
00:03:09.900,00:03:15.620,"is significantly more, as we'll call photo-aged, or old-looking, than the other side of their face.",0.0
00:03:15.620,00:03:21.400,"So that's mostly UVA and UVA, as I said, it's a longer wavelength, penetrates a little bit deeper.",0.0
00:03:21.400,00:03:26.440,so wrinkles mostly come from destruction of our collagen and elastin,-0.5719
00:03:26.440,00:03:30.380,which is natural fibers that hold up the scaffolding of our skin,0.3612
00:03:30.380,00:03:33.840,so with age the cells that secrete collagen,0.0
00:03:33.840,00:03:37.020,they're called fibroblasts they stop producing as much,-0.296
00:03:37.020,00:03:41.800,and what the Sun does is it breaks down the existing collagen and elastin we have,0.0
00:03:41.800,00:03:48.040,"so fibroblasts really like to be stretched, they like to be pulled and collagen does that, that collagen matrix",0.6764
00:03:48.040,00:03:52.760,so the Sun damages the collagen fibers leading to less stretch on fibroblasts,-0.4877
00:03:52.760,00:03:55.000,and less production of collagen,0.0
00:03:55.000,00:03:58.020,which means that you look a little more saggy,0.0
00:03:58.020,00:04:04.560,I know it's very depressing so sun protection helps the degradation of those collagen and elastin fibers,-0.5314
00:04:04.560,00:04:09.120,You know there are a lot of creams on the market that claim to be anti-aging,0.0
00:04:09.120,00:04:11.280,but the one that really works,0.0
00:04:11.280,00:04:13.360,is sunscreen,0.0
00:04:13.360,00:04:18.580,preventing ultraviolet light from hitting your skin is the best thing you can do,0.6249
00:04:18.580,00:04:22.680,to avoid skin cancer and to avoid photo aging,-0.8316
00:04:22.680,00:04:26.820,So yeah. It's good advice. Use sunscreen.,0.6865
00:04:30.960,00:04:33.840,hey I'm on set for Jurassic world fallen,-0.3612
