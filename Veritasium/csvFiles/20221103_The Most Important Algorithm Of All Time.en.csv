00:00:00.090,00:00:04.417,"This is a video about the most important algorithm of all time,"
00:00:04.417,00:00:07.350,"the Fast Fourier Transform or FFT."
00:00:07.350,00:00:09.270,"I mean, you use it all the time"
00:00:09.270,00:00:11.310,"including right now to watch this video"
00:00:11.310,00:00:15.390,"and it's used in radar and sonar, 5G and WiFi."
00:00:15.390,00:00:17.910,"Basically, anytime a signal is processed,"
00:00:17.910,00:00:20.100,"there's a good chance that a Fast Fourier Transform"
00:00:20.100,00:00:21.210,"is involved."
00:00:21.210,00:00:25.260,"But on top of all this, the FFT was discovered by scientists"
00:00:25.260,00:00:28.470,"trying to detect covert nuclear weapons tests."
00:00:28.470,00:00:30.540,"And if they had discovered it sooner,"
00:00:30.540,00:00:33.423,"it may have put a stop to the nuclear arms race."
00:00:36.750,00:00:39.090,"You know I always assumed that the nuclear arms race"
00:00:39.090,00:00:41.850,"was inevitable, that once the U.S. dropped atomic bombs"
00:00:41.850,00:00:43.440,"on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,"
00:00:43.440,00:00:45.960,"it was just unavoidable that all the other major powers"
00:00:45.960,00:00:47.370,"would develop nukes."
00:00:47.370,00:00:51.090,"But maybe it wasn't because it was clear to everyone"
00:00:51.090,00:00:54.060,"that nuclear weapons were game changing."
00:00:54.060,00:00:56.760,"The bomb dropped on Hiroshima released a thousand times"
00:00:56.760,00:00:59.880,"more energy than the biggest conventional explosive"
00:00:59.880,00:01:02.643,"so other countries were rightfully concerned."
00:01:03.630,00:01:05.550,"At the end of the war, Canada and the U.K."
00:01:05.550,00:01:08.220,"requested a meeting to discuss what would be done"
00:01:08.220,00:01:09.900,"about nuclear weapons."
00:01:09.900,00:01:12.240,"And contrary to what I expected,"
00:01:12.240,00:01:15.510,"the U.S. was actually open to these discussions."
00:01:15.510,00:01:18.060,"They realized that they wouldn't be the only nation"
00:01:18.060,00:01:19.920,"with nukes for long."
00:01:19.920,00:01:22.860,"So they offered to decommission all their nuclear weapons"
00:01:22.860,00:01:25.533,"if other nations would pledge never to make them."
00:01:28.770,00:01:31.560,"This was known as the Baruch plan"
00:01:31.560,00:01:34.290,"and it proposed that an international body would control"
00:01:34.290,00:01:36.510,"all radioactive materials on earth,"
00:01:36.510,00:01:39.840,"from mining to refining to using these materials"
00:01:39.840,00:01:43.230,"for peaceful purposes as a nuclear power generation."
00:01:43.230,00:01:45.750,"But the Soviets rejected the proposal."
00:01:45.750,00:01:48.240,"They saw it as just another ploy to maintain"
00:01:48.240,00:01:49.830,"American nuclear dominance"
00:01:49.830,00:01:53.283,"and so the global nuclear arms race began."
00:01:55.560,00:01:59.310,"To develop new nuclear weapons required extensive testing"
00:01:59.310,00:02:02.160,"and most of it was done in remote places like the Arctic"
00:02:02.160,00:02:04.500,"or the South Pacific Islands."
00:02:04.500,00:02:07.620,"The U.S. also created a nuclear testing site in Nevada,"
00:02:07.620,00:02:10.800,"the radioactive products of which blew across the country"
00:02:10.800,00:02:14.190,"so that outside of Japan, the people most adversely affected"
00:02:14.190,00:02:18.750,"by American nuclear weapons were Americans themselves."
00:02:18.750,00:02:21.510,"The U.S. soon graduated from fission weapons"
00:02:21.510,00:02:24.400,"to thermonuclear bombs which combined fission and fusion"
00:02:24.400,00:02:27.303,"to release even more energy."
00:02:28.980,00:02:31.440,"They were as big leap from the first atomic bombs"
00:02:31.440,00:02:34.260,"as those devices were from conventional explosives,"
00:02:34.260,00:02:37.203,"a thousand times again more powerful."
00:02:37.203,00:02:41.700,"- Annihilation of any life on earth has being brought"
00:02:41.700,00:02:44.647,"within the range of technical possibility."
00:02:48.752,00:02:51.780,"- [Narrator] In 1954 at Bikini Atoll in the South Pacific,"
00:02:51.780,00:02:54.030,"the U.S. tested a new thermonuclear design"
00:02:54.030,00:02:56.880,"that used lithium deuteride as a fuel"
00:02:56.880,00:02:58.950,"and they expected the device code named Shrimp"
00:02:58.950,00:03:03.480,"to release the energy equivalent of six million tons of TNT"
00:03:03.480,00:03:04.871,"but they were wrong."
00:03:04.871,00:03:07.371,"(bomb blasts)"
00:03:09.270,00:03:11.610,"It released two and a half times that"
00:03:11.610,00:03:15.210,"due to unanticipated reactions with lithium-7."
00:03:15.210,00:03:18.630,"And as a result, more radioactive material was created"
00:03:18.630,00:03:22.500,"and it rained down over a much larger area than planned."
00:03:22.500,00:03:24.930,"Residents of neighboring atolls were only evacuated"
00:03:24.930,00:03:28.260,"three days later suffering from radiation sickness."
00:03:28.260,00:03:31.410,"And further east, the 23 crew of a Japanese fishing boat"
00:03:31.410,00:03:34.920,"were caught in a flurry of radioactive white ash."
00:03:34.920,00:03:35.820,"And by that evening,"
00:03:35.820,00:03:38.320,"they were suffering from acute radiation syndrome."
00:03:39.210,00:03:41.289,"One of the crew died from ensuing complications"
00:03:41.289,00:03:42.497,"six months later."
00:03:42.497,00:03:44.074,"- [Reporter] As a result of the extended illness"
00:03:44.074,00:03:46.793,"brought about by his exposure to the radiation fallout."
00:03:48.690,00:03:51.090,"- These events triggered public outcry"
00:03:51.090,00:03:52.800,"against nuclear testing."
00:03:52.800,00:03:55.860,"The modern peace sign was designed in the 1950s"
00:03:55.860,00:03:59.220,"by combining the semaphore letters for N and D"
00:03:59.220,00:04:01.800,"standing for nuclear disarmament."
00:04:01.800,00:04:04.650,"A number of world leaders called for a comprehensive"
00:04:04.650,00:04:09.090,"test ban, no more testing of nuclear weapons by any state"
00:04:09.090,00:04:11.880,"and this call was actually taken seriously"
00:04:11.880,00:04:13.500,"by the world's nuclear powers."
00:04:13.500,00:04:15.450,"They entered into negotiations at meetings"
00:04:15.450,00:04:17.250,"with very literal names like"
00:04:17.250,00:04:20.550,"the Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Weapon Tests"
00:04:20.550,00:04:22.683,"held in Geneva in 1958."
00:04:24.060,00:04:26.190,"And to show just how serious they were,"
00:04:26.190,00:04:29.220,"they even stopped all testing during the negotiations"
00:04:29.220,00:04:33.420,"which is why 1959 is the only year in a long stretch"
00:04:33.420,00:04:35.703,"when no nuclear weapons were detonated."
00:04:36.960,00:04:39.360,"But there was a big problem with negotiating"
00:04:39.360,00:04:42.750,"a comprehensive test ban which is how do you know"
00:04:42.750,00:04:46.170,"that the other side will hold up their end of the bargain?"
00:04:46.170,00:04:48.540,"The U.S. worried that the Soviets would continue"
00:04:48.540,00:04:51.810,"testing covertly and leapfrog them technologically"
00:04:51.810,00:04:55.230,"and the Soviets similarly distrusted the U.S.."
00:04:55.230,00:04:56.850,"So to address these concerns,"
00:04:56.850,00:04:59.790,"they convened the Conference of Experts to Study"
00:04:59.790,00:05:02.250,"the Possibility of Detecting Violations"
00:05:02.250,00:05:06.540,"of a Possible Agreement on Suspension of Nuclear Tests."
00:05:06.540,00:05:10.503,"Seriously, that was the name, I am not making this up."
00:05:13.260,00:05:16.830,"Now detecting atmospheric tests was fairly straightforward."
00:05:16.830,00:05:19.440,"The radioactive isotopes they produced disperse"
00:05:19.440,00:05:21.120,"in the atmosphere and can be detected"
00:05:21.120,00:05:22.983,"thousands of kilometers away."
00:05:23.940,00:05:26.520,"Underwater tests produce distinctive sounds"
00:05:26.520,00:05:29.610,"that travel efficiently around a kilometer below the surface"
00:05:29.610,00:05:32.793,"of the ocean and these can be picked up by hydrophones."
00:05:33.630,00:05:37.320,"But underground tests are much harder to detect from afar"
00:05:37.320,00:05:40.530,"because their radiation is mostly contained"
00:05:40.530,00:05:43.950,"and the Soviets refused to allow onsite compliance visits"
00:05:43.950,00:05:46.290,"which they regarded as espionage."
00:05:46.290,00:05:49.800,"And this is ultimately why when a test ban treaty was signed"
00:05:49.800,00:05:53.670,"in 1963, it was only a partial ban."
00:05:53.670,00:05:55.410,"It banned testing underwater,"
00:05:55.410,00:05:57.450,"in the atmosphere and in space,"
00:05:57.450,00:05:59.670,"places where compliance could be verified,"
00:05:59.670,00:06:03.030,"but it didn't ban testing underground for the simple reason"
00:06:03.030,00:06:06.330,"that it was almost impossible to verify compliance."
00:06:06.330,00:06:08.730,"But scientists had been trying to find a way"
00:06:08.730,00:06:11.700,"to reliably detect underground detonations."
00:06:11.700,00:06:14.640,"Following the Geneva meeting, American and Soviet scientists"
00:06:14.640,00:06:17.400,"formed a working group to discuss the issue"
00:06:17.400,00:06:20.190,"and their idea was to use seismometers located"
00:06:20.190,00:06:22.680,"outside the countries where nukes were being tested"
00:06:22.680,00:06:27.210,"to detect the faint ground vibrations caused by explosions."
00:06:27.210,00:06:30.570,"The problem was how do you distinguish a nuclear test"
00:06:30.570,00:06:32.340,"from an earthquake?"
00:06:32.340,00:06:33.480,"Every day around the world,"
00:06:33.480,00:06:35.670,"there are close to 300 earthquakes"
00:06:35.670,00:06:37.863,"with a magnitude of three or greater."
00:06:39.300,00:06:41.760,"In addition, part of the purpose of detecting"
00:06:41.760,00:06:44.460,"your adversaries tests is to spy on them,"
00:06:44.460,00:06:47.490,"to know how big of an explosion they can make."
00:06:47.490,00:06:50.400,"But the seismometer signal depends not only on the yield"
00:06:50.400,00:06:54.360,"of the device but also on how deep it was buried."
00:06:54.360,00:06:58.620,"For a given yield, deeper explosions appear smaller."
00:06:58.620,00:07:01.500,"So scientists wanted a method to reliably determine"
00:07:01.500,00:07:04.530,"whether a given signal was a bomb or an earthquake"
00:07:04.530,00:07:06.990,"and if it was a bomb, how big it was"
00:07:06.990,00:07:09.240,"and how deep it was buried."
00:07:09.240,00:07:11.850,"They knew that all this information was contained"
00:07:11.850,00:07:15.210,"in the seismometer signal but it couldn't just be read off"
00:07:15.210,00:07:16.800,"by looking at the squiggles."
00:07:16.800,00:07:19.740,"They needed to know how much of different frequencies"
00:07:19.740,00:07:22.740,"were present which meant they needed to take"
00:07:22.740,00:07:24.513,"a Fourier transform."
00:07:25.860,00:07:28.860,"A Fourier transform is a way of decomposing a signal"
00:07:28.860,00:07:32.220,"into pure sine waves, each with its own amplitude"
00:07:32.220,00:07:35.580,"and frequency that add to make it up."
00:07:35.580,00:07:38.250,"This seems a bit like magic since the sum"
00:07:38.250,00:07:40.890,"of a set of sine waves can look arbitrarily complicated"
00:07:40.890,00:07:44.040,"and nothing like its component parts."
00:07:44.040,00:07:46.230,"There are some elegant ways to understand"
00:07:46.230,00:07:47.850,"how Fourier transforms work,"
00:07:47.850,00:07:50.730,"shout out to the awesome video by 3Blue1Brown."
00:07:50.730,00:07:53.820,"But I wanna take more of a brute force approach."
00:07:53.820,00:07:56.700,"If you wanna know how much of a particular sine wave"
00:07:56.700,00:08:00.240,"is in a signal, just multiply the signal by the sine wave"
00:08:00.240,00:08:05.130,"at each point and then add up the area under the curve."
00:08:05.130,00:08:08.670,"As a simple example, say our signal is just a sine wave"
00:08:08.670,00:08:11.520,"with a certain frequency but pretend we don't know that"
00:08:11.520,00:08:12.930,"and we're trying to figure out"
00:08:12.930,00:08:15.600,"which sine waves add to make it up."
00:08:15.600,00:08:17.910,"Well, if you multiply this signal by a sine wave"
00:08:17.910,00:08:22.110,"of an arbitrary frequency, the two waves are uncorrelated."
00:08:22.110,00:08:23.850,"You're just as likely to find places where they have"
00:08:23.850,00:08:26.880,"the same sign, both positive or both negative"
00:08:26.880,00:08:29.610,"as where they have opposite signs and therefore"
00:08:29.610,00:08:32.970,"when you multiply them together, the area above the x-axis"
00:08:32.970,00:08:35.490,"is equal to the area below the x-axis."
00:08:35.490,00:08:38.880,"So these areas add up to zero which means"
00:08:38.880,00:08:42.630,"that frequency sine wave is not a part of your signal"
00:08:42.630,00:08:45.120,"and this will be true for almost all frequencies"
00:08:45.120,00:08:46.920,"you could try assuming you're looking over"
00:08:46.920,00:08:48.630,"a long enough timeframe."
00:08:48.630,00:08:51.900,"The only exception is if the frequency of the sine wave"
00:08:51.900,00:08:55.080,"exactly matches that of the signal,"
00:08:55.080,00:08:57.750,"now these waves are correlated"
00:08:57.750,00:09:01.020,"so their product is always positive and so is the area"
00:09:01.020,00:09:02.910,"under the curve that indicates"
00:09:02.910,00:09:06.390,"that this sine wave is part of our signal."
00:09:06.390,00:09:08.820,"And this trick works even if the signal is composed"
00:09:08.820,00:09:10.830,"of a bunch of different frequencies."
00:09:10.830,00:09:13.560,"If the sine waves frequency is one of the components"
00:09:13.560,00:09:15.750,"of the signal it will correlate with the signal"
00:09:15.750,00:09:17.850,"producing a non-zero area."
00:09:17.850,00:09:20.940,"And the size of this area tells you the relative amplitude"
00:09:20.940,00:09:24.060,"of that frequency sine wave in the signal."
00:09:24.060,00:09:27.300,"Repeat this process for all frequencies of sine waves"
00:09:27.300,00:09:29.190,"and you get the frequency spectrum."
00:09:29.190,00:09:31.500,"Essentially which frequencies are present"
00:09:31.500,00:09:33.393,"and in what proportions."
00:09:35.580,00:09:38.250,"Now so far I've only talked about sine waves"
00:09:38.250,00:09:40.800,"but if the signal is a cosine wave,"
00:09:40.800,00:09:42.810,"then even if you multiply it by a sine wave"
00:09:42.810,00:09:44.640,"of the exact same frequency,"
00:09:44.640,00:09:47.400,"the area under the curve will be zero."
00:09:47.400,00:09:48.690,"So for each frequency,"
00:09:48.690,00:09:51.420,"we actually need to multiply by a sine wave"
00:09:51.420,00:09:55.530,"and a cosine wave and find the amplitudes for each."
00:09:55.530,00:09:58.830,"The ratio of these amplitudes indicates the phase"
00:09:58.830,00:10:01.320,"of the signal that is how much it's shifted"
00:10:01.320,00:10:03.330,"to the left or to the right."
00:10:03.330,00:10:05.820,"You can calculate these sine and cosine amplitudes"
00:10:05.820,00:10:09.570,"separately or you can use Euler's formula"
00:10:09.570,00:10:11.160,"so you only need to multiply your signal"
00:10:11.160,00:10:13.440,"by one exponential term."
00:10:13.440,00:10:16.380,"Then the real part of the sum is the cosine amplitude"
00:10:16.380,00:10:19.593,"and the imaginary part is the sine amplitude."
00:10:20.790,00:10:22.980,"In the American delegation at the Geneva meeting,"
00:10:22.980,00:10:24.870,"there was a physicist, Richard Garwin"
00:10:24.870,00:10:27.120,"and a mathematician John Tukey."
00:10:27.120,00:10:29.640,"They got into a debate with the Soviet delegation"
00:10:29.640,00:10:32.700,"over which nation's seismometers were superior."
00:10:32.700,00:10:36.780,"So Garwin simulated the responses of both countries' devices"
00:10:36.780,00:10:39.000,"on a computer at CERN."
00:10:39.000,00:10:43.500,"The next day, everyone agreed there wasn't much difference."
00:10:43.500,00:10:46.860,"The real obstacle to detecting underground explosions"
00:10:46.860,00:10:49.170,"wasn't the accuracy of the seismometers,"
00:10:49.170,00:10:51.690,"it was the vast amounts of computation required"
00:10:51.690,00:10:54.513,"to Fourier transform the seismometer signals."
00:10:56.160,00:10:58.200,"Here's an example seismometer signal"
00:10:58.200,00:11:00.150,"and its Fourier transform."
00:11:00.150,00:11:02.430,"Thus far I've been thinking about signals"
00:11:02.430,00:11:04.650,"as infinite continuous waves"
00:11:04.650,00:11:06.300,"and when you take their Fourier transform,"
00:11:06.300,00:11:09.960,"you get an infinite continuous frequency spectrum."
00:11:09.960,00:11:12.240,"But real world signals are not like that."
00:11:12.240,00:11:14.940,"They are finite and made up of individual samples"
00:11:14.940,00:11:16.440,"or data points."
00:11:16.440,00:11:19.050,"Even though a seismometer signal looks smooth"
00:11:19.050,00:11:22.200,"and continuous, it doesn't record ground motion"
00:11:22.200,00:11:24.180,"with infinite precision."
00:11:24.180,00:11:27.270,"There is some fundamental graininess to the data"
00:11:27.270,00:11:30.900,"so what you have is discreet finite data."
00:11:30.900,00:11:34.890,"So you can't use the idealized Fourier transform."
00:11:34.890,00:11:37.110,"Instead, you have to perform something"
00:11:37.110,00:11:40.110,"called a Discreet Fourier Transform."
00:11:40.110,00:11:42.060,"And one of the distinguishing features"
00:11:42.060,00:11:43.860,"of a Discreet Fourier Transform"
00:11:43.860,00:11:48.270,"is that the frequency spectrum is also discreet and finite."
00:11:48.270,00:11:49.650,"You can think of the frequencies"
00:11:49.650,00:11:53.370,"as falling into a finite number of bins."
00:11:53.370,00:11:56.370,"And what determines the number and size of these bins"
00:11:56.370,00:11:58.290,"is the number of samples in the signal"
00:11:58.290,00:12:00.810,"and how closely spaced they are."
00:12:00.810,00:12:03.960,"For example, the more spaced out the samples are,"
00:12:03.960,00:12:06.660,"the lower the maximum frequency you can measure."
00:12:06.660,00:12:08.790,"Because the samples aren't close enough together"
00:12:08.790,00:12:12.030,"to capture high frequency oscillations,"
00:12:12.030,00:12:14.400,"the shorter the duration of the signal,"
00:12:14.400,00:12:17.520,"the harder it is to tell similar frequencies apart."
00:12:17.520,00:12:20.550,"So this lowers the frequency resolution."
00:12:20.550,00:12:25.230,"The shorter the signal, the wider each frequency bin is."
00:12:25.230,00:12:28.950,"The lowest non-zero frequency you can effectively measure"
00:12:28.950,00:12:32.850,"is one whose period is equal to the duration of the signal."
00:12:32.850,00:12:35.880,"And the higher frequency bins are just integer multiples"
00:12:35.880,00:12:36.990,"of this frequency."
00:12:36.990,00:12:40.620,"So they fit two, three, four, and so on periods"
00:12:40.620,00:12:42.690,"in the duration of the signal."
00:12:42.690,00:12:46.200,"The total number of frequency bins is equal"
00:12:46.200,00:12:48.570,"to the number of samples in the signal."
00:12:48.570,00:12:51.030,"So if the signal is made up of eight samples,"
00:12:51.030,00:12:53.760,"then the transform has eight frequency bins"
00:12:53.760,00:12:58.530,"going from zero up to seven times the fundamental frequency."
00:12:58.530,00:13:00.540,"So let's do an example."
00:13:00.540,00:13:03.960,"Say we have a signal made up of eight samples."
00:13:03.960,00:13:05.940,"Well, then the discrete Fourier transform"
00:13:05.940,00:13:08.460,"will have eight frequency bins."
00:13:08.460,00:13:11.940,"The first bin corresponds to a frequency of zero."
00:13:11.940,00:13:13.950,"Essentially this measures if the signal"
00:13:13.950,00:13:17.250,"is systematically shifted off the x-axis."
00:13:17.250,00:13:20.670,"You can think of it as measuring the DC offset."
00:13:20.670,00:13:23.070,"You multiply each data point by one"
00:13:23.070,00:13:26.673,"and add them all together, in this case, they add to zero."
00:13:28.290,00:13:31.260,"The second frequency bin corresponds to the frequency"
00:13:31.260,00:13:34.590,"that fits one period in the duration of the signal."
00:13:34.590,00:13:37.740,"So in this case that corresponds to one hertz."
00:13:37.740,00:13:41.610,"You multiply each point by a sine wave of this frequency"
00:13:41.610,00:13:44.430,"and a cosine wave of this frequency"
00:13:44.430,00:13:46.740,"and separately add them up."
00:13:46.740,00:13:48.780,"For sine, they add to zero."
00:13:48.780,00:13:51.390,"For cosine, they add to four"
00:13:51.390,00:13:54.840,"and then repeat the process for two hertz, three hertz,"
00:13:54.840,00:13:57.390,"and so on, up to seven hertz."
00:13:57.390,00:14:00.570,"And you have the discreet Fourier transform"
00:14:00.570,00:14:02.970,"of this really simple signal."
00:14:02.970,00:14:05.730,"Now this process works fine in principle"
00:14:05.730,00:14:07.530,"and you could use it to calculate"
00:14:07.530,00:14:09.900,"all discrete Fourier transforms."
00:14:09.900,00:14:14.160,"But the problem is it requires way too many calculations."
00:14:14.160,00:14:16.590,"To complete one discrete Fourier transform"
00:14:16.590,00:14:18.810,"requires multiplying N data points"
00:14:18.810,00:14:21.360,"by N different frequency waves."
00:14:21.360,00:14:24.990,"So N squared complex multiplications."
00:14:24.990,00:14:27.390,"Now this is doable for eight samples"
00:14:27.390,00:14:30.180,"but if you had say a million samples,"
00:14:30.180,00:14:32.250,"that would require a million squared"
00:14:32.250,00:14:35.253,"or one trillion calculations."
00:14:37.350,00:14:39.750,"At the speed of 1960s computers,"
00:14:39.750,00:14:42.330,"that would take over three years to complete,"
00:14:42.330,00:14:44.580,"all for a single transform."
00:14:44.580,00:14:47.520,"Now a million samples is admittedly more than you would need"
00:14:47.520,00:14:50.910,"for a single seismic event but to analyze tens of events"
00:14:50.910,00:14:53.160,"per day from hundreds of seismometers,"
00:14:53.160,00:14:55.590,"it would just be far too time consuming"
00:14:55.590,00:14:57.630,"and that's what gave scientists the impetus"
00:14:57.630,00:14:59.850,"to look for a better way."
00:14:59.850,00:15:02.490,"And the breakthrough came in 1963 at a meeting"
00:15:02.490,00:15:04.950,"of the President's Science Advisory Committee."
00:15:04.950,00:15:06.750,"President John F. Kennedy was there,"
00:15:06.750,00:15:08.250,"as were Garwin and Tukey,"
00:15:08.250,00:15:11.340,"the physicist and mathematician from the Geneva meeting."
00:15:11.340,00:15:14.130,"Although they were discussing issues of national importance"
00:15:14.130,00:15:17.250,"like the Apollo program and nuclear fallout shelters,"
00:15:17.250,00:15:19.830,"the meeting was apparently pretty boring."
00:15:19.830,00:15:23.130,"Garwin observed Tukey doodling throughout"
00:15:23.130,00:15:25.020,"but what he was actually doing"
00:15:25.020,00:15:28.440,"was working on discreet Fourier transforms."
00:15:28.440,00:15:30.390,"At the end of the meeting, Garwin asked Tukey"
00:15:30.390,00:15:33.330,"what he had worked out and he was shocked to learn"
00:15:33.330,00:15:36.600,"that Tukey knew a way to compute discreet Fourier transforms"
00:15:36.600,00:15:39.090,"with many fewer computations."
00:15:39.090,00:15:40.950,"It would mean that the calculation that would've taken"
00:15:40.950,00:15:45.120,"over three years could be done in just 35 minutes."
00:15:45.120,00:15:49.260,"This has aptly become known as the Fast Fourier Transform."
00:15:49.260,00:15:51.453,"So here is how it works."
00:15:53.940,00:15:56.670,"Consider the example from before with eight samples."
00:15:56.670,00:15:58.470,"Each of those data points must be multiplied"
00:15:58.470,00:16:00.810,"by the eight different frequency waves."
00:16:00.810,00:16:04.260,"Here I'm only showing cosines for simplicity."
00:16:04.260,00:16:06.990,"So you would expect this to require eight times eight"
00:16:06.990,00:16:10.020,"or 64 complex multiplication."
00:16:10.020,00:16:13.170,"But due to the periodic nature of sinusoids,"
00:16:13.170,00:16:15.330,"these waves of different frequencies"
00:16:15.330,00:16:17.970,"overlap in a predictable way."
00:16:17.970,00:16:20.520,"For example, at the middle data point,"
00:16:20.520,00:16:23.670,"all of the four odd frequencies have the same value"
00:16:23.670,00:16:25.770,"and all of the four even frequencies"
00:16:25.770,00:16:27.270,"have the same value as well."
00:16:27.270,00:16:29.970,"So instead of doing eight multiplication,"
00:16:29.970,00:16:32.130,"you only need to do two."
00:16:32.130,00:16:33.870,"And this sort of duplication occurs"
00:16:33.870,00:16:35.910,"at the other data points as well."
00:16:35.910,00:16:40.773,"So instead of performing 64 calculations, you need only 24."
00:16:41.700,00:16:44.070,"Now that might seem like a small improvement"
00:16:44.070,00:16:46.020,"but it's the difference between a calculation"
00:16:46.020,00:16:49.260,"that scales as N, the number of samples squared"
00:16:49.260,00:16:52.980,"versus one that scales as Nlog base two of N"
00:16:52.980,00:16:54.870,"which means the bigger the data set,"
00:16:54.870,00:16:56.940,"the greater the savings."
00:16:56.940,00:16:59.820,"A signal with a thousand samples would require"
00:16:59.820,00:17:03.900,"100 times fewer calculations and a million samples"
00:17:03.900,00:17:07.623,"would require 50,000 times fewer calculations."
00:17:08.580,00:17:12.900,"But how do you know which calculations are redundant?"
00:17:12.900,00:17:15.510,"Well, take your samples and split them"
00:17:15.510,00:17:18.900,"into even and odd index points."
00:17:18.900,00:17:20.040,"You still need to multiply"
00:17:20.040,00:17:23.370,"each of these by the eight different frequency waves."
00:17:23.370,00:17:26.940,"But now let's look only at the even points and compare"
00:17:26.940,00:17:31.290,"the first four frequencies to the second four frequencies."
00:17:31.290,00:17:33.930,"And what you find is that in each case"
00:17:33.930,00:17:35.730,"at the location of the samples,"
00:17:35.730,00:17:38.883,"the values of the two sine waves are the same."
00:17:39.840,00:17:43.620,"A similar pattern can be observed for the odd index points"
00:17:43.620,00:17:46.860,"except the values of one sine wave are the negative"
00:17:46.860,00:17:47.940,"of the other."
00:17:47.940,00:17:51.510,"More generally, they're related by a complex number."
00:17:51.510,00:17:54.900,"But what this means is that you don't have to do"
00:17:54.900,00:17:57.180,"all the multiplication for the second half"
00:17:57.180,00:17:58.680,"of the frequencies."
00:17:58.680,00:18:01.620,"Once you've calculated the odd and even sums"
00:18:01.620,00:18:03.720,"for the lower half the frequencies,"
00:18:03.720,00:18:08.160,"you can reuse these values to find the upper half."
00:18:08.160,00:18:10.950,"So you've effectively cut the number of calculations"
00:18:10.950,00:18:15.270,"required in half but that's only a factor of two,"
00:18:15.270,00:18:18.480,"how do you get down to Nlog base two of N?"
00:18:18.480,00:18:20.670,"Well, you repeat the same trick,"
00:18:20.670,00:18:24.420,"split the samples again into even an odd points"
00:18:24.420,00:18:26.910,"and then again repeatedly"
00:18:26.910,00:18:30.030,"until you're down to single data points."
00:18:30.030,00:18:32.730,"At each split, you can exploit the symmetries"
00:18:32.730,00:18:35.850,"of sinusoidal functions to cut the number of calculations"
00:18:35.850,00:18:37.140,"in half."
00:18:37.140,00:18:40.230,"And that is how the Fast Fourier Transform reduces"
00:18:40.230,00:18:43.233,"N squared calculations down to NlogN."
00:18:44.070,00:18:45.930,"And it's why today whenever anyone takes"
00:18:45.930,00:18:48.960,"a Fourier transform, it's almost always done"
00:18:48.960,00:18:51.123,"as a Fast Fourier Transform."
00:18:52.110,00:18:54.960,"Garwin approached an IBM researcher, James Cooley"
00:18:54.960,00:18:58.200,"to program a computer to run the FFT algorithm"
00:18:58.200,00:19:00.540,"but he didn't tell him the reason was to detect"
00:19:00.540,00:19:02.370,"underground Soviet nuclear tests."
00:19:02.370,00:19:04.020,"He said it was to work out the spins"
00:19:04.020,00:19:06.240,"in a crystal of helium-3."
00:19:06.240,00:19:08.370,"Cooley and Tukey published the algorithm"
00:19:08.370,00:19:13.370,"in a seminal 1965 paper and its use immediately took off"
00:19:13.590,00:19:16.110,"but it was too late to secure"
00:19:16.110,00:19:18.093,"a comprehensive nuclear test ban."
00:19:19.129,00:19:21.960,"By that time, the U.K., France and China"
00:19:21.960,00:19:25.353,"had joined the Soviet Union and the U.S. as nuclear powers."
00:19:27.060,00:19:28.890,"And the partial test ban treaty,"
00:19:28.890,00:19:31.560,"far from deescalating the nuclear arms race"
00:19:31.560,00:19:33.780,"just sent it underground."
00:19:33.780,00:19:35.700,"The thinking was if you were only allowed"
00:19:35.700,00:19:39.000,"to test underground, then you better be testing extensively"
00:19:39.000,00:19:42.420,"so as not to fall behind all the other nuclear states."
00:19:42.420,00:19:47.040,"So from 1963, 1,500 nuclear weapons were detonated."
00:19:47.040,00:19:50.970,"That's roughly one a week for 30 years."
00:19:50.970,00:19:52.980,"This testing facilitated the construction"
00:19:52.980,00:19:55.380,"of an absurd number of nukes."
00:19:55.380,00:19:57.161,"At the peak in the mid 1980s,"
00:19:57.161,00:20:01.350,"70,000 nuclear warheads were in existence."
00:20:01.350,00:20:03.840,"Total expenditure on nukes in the 20th century"
00:20:03.840,00:20:08.280,"is estimated at around $10 trillion each for the U.S."
00:20:08.280,00:20:11.280,"and the Soviet Union adjusting for inflation."
00:20:11.280,00:20:14.010,"If only scientists had been confident in their ability"
00:20:14.010,00:20:17.430,"to remotely detect underground tests in the early 1960s,"
00:20:17.430,00:20:20.220,"then a comprehensive test ban could have been reached,"
00:20:20.220,00:20:24.390,"stopping the nuclear arms race before it really got going."
00:20:24.390,00:20:26.580,"To check how realistic this is,"
00:20:26.580,00:20:29.430,"I asked Richard Garwin himself."
00:20:29.430,00:20:30.813,"- Well, it's a good story."
00:20:32.123,00:20:33.602,"- It is a good story."
00:20:33.602,00:20:37.530,"- It would've helped and it might have turned the tide."
00:20:37.530,00:20:40.020,"- But that would've required an earlier discovery"
00:20:40.020,00:20:43.680,"of the Fast Fourier Transform and as luck would have it,"
00:20:43.680,00:20:47.193,"it was discovered earlier but then forgotten."
00:20:48.090,00:20:51.750,"All the way back in 1805, Mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss"
00:20:51.750,00:20:53.790,"was studying the newly discovered asteroids"
00:20:53.790,00:20:56.340,"of Pallas, Ceres and Juno."
00:20:56.340,00:20:57.930,"To determine the orbit of Juno,"
00:20:57.930,00:21:00.870,"Gauss devised a novel approach to harmonic analysis"
00:21:00.870,00:21:02.730,"and he jotted it down in his notes"
00:21:02.730,00:21:04.800,"but later used a different method"
00:21:04.800,00:21:07.830,"and he never thought to publish that first insight."
00:21:07.830,00:21:10.470,"Today we can see that Gauss had figured out"
00:21:10.470,00:21:13.890,"the discreet Fourier Transform before Joseph Fourier himself"
00:21:13.890,00:21:15.900,"published it in 1807."
00:21:15.900,00:21:18.960,"And he had developed the same Fast Fourier Transform"
00:21:18.960,00:21:23.880,"algorithm as Cooley and Tukey a century and a half earlier."
00:21:23.880,00:21:25.980,"The reason his breakthrough was not widely adopted"
00:21:25.980,00:21:29.460,"was because it only appeared after his death in volume three"
00:21:29.460,00:21:32.520,"of his collected works and it was written with non-standard"
00:21:32.520,00:21:36.480,"notation in a 19th century version of Latin."
00:21:36.480,00:21:39.060,"What do you think would've happened if Gauss had realized"
00:21:39.060,00:21:41.730,"the significance of his discovery and had published it"
00:21:41.730,00:21:44.160,"in a way that others could understand?"
00:21:44.160,00:21:46.260,"With our modern network of seismometers"
00:21:46.260,00:21:48.810,"and computing and the Fast Fourier Transform,"
00:21:48.810,00:21:51.930,"today, we have the ability to detect magnitude three events"
00:21:51.930,00:21:55.530,"which correspond to a one kilo ton or so explosion,"
00:21:55.530,00:21:58.320,"basically anywhere on earth."
00:21:58.320,00:22:02.460,"Following Cooley and Tukey's paper, the use of FFTs exploded"
00:22:02.460,00:22:05.340,"and they are the basis for most compression algorithms"
00:22:05.340,00:22:06.840,"like the ones that allow you to watch"
00:22:06.840,00:22:09.210,"and listen to this video."
00:22:09.210,00:22:10.950,"Here's how the Fast Fourier Transform"
00:22:10.950,00:22:13.290,"allows you to compress an image."
00:22:13.290,00:22:16.740,"You take the pixel brightness values for each row"
00:22:16.740,00:22:20.880,"of an image and perform a Fast Fourier transform."
00:22:20.880,00:22:23.640,"So essentially, you're figuring out what frequencies"
00:22:23.640,00:22:26.100,"are present in the brightness values"
00:22:26.100,00:22:27.930,"of the rows of an image."
00:22:27.930,00:22:30.150,"Here, brightness represents the magnitude"
00:22:30.150,00:22:32.400,"of each frequency component and the color"
00:22:32.400,00:22:35.250,"represents the phase, how shifted that frequency is"
00:22:35.250,00:22:37.020,"to the left or the right."
00:22:37.020,00:22:42.020,"And then you perform another FFT for the columns of pixels."
00:22:42.090,00:22:45.300,"It doesn't matter if you do the rows or columns first,"
00:22:45.300,00:22:48.570,"which you need is a two dimensional FFT"
00:22:48.570,00:22:49.833,"of the original image."
00:22:50.700,00:22:53.460,"For almost all real world images,"
00:22:53.460,00:22:56.280,"you find that a lot of the values in the transform"
00:22:56.280,00:22:58.200,"are close to zero."
00:22:58.200,00:23:00.150,"I've taken the log of the transform values"
00:23:00.150,00:23:03.030,"so you can see them but if I don't, then it's clear"
00:23:03.030,00:23:05.280,"most of the values, especially toward the edges"
00:23:05.280,00:23:10.140,"are very small and these correspond to high frequencies."
00:23:10.140,00:23:12.540,"And what this means is that you can throw out"
00:23:12.540,00:23:15.180,"a lot of the information in the transformed image"
00:23:15.180,00:23:17.520,"say 99% of it."
00:23:17.520,00:23:21.630,"But when you invert that result, you still get a fairly good"
00:23:21.630,00:23:24.570,"representation of the original image."
00:23:24.570,00:23:27.540,"So on your computer, most of the images will be saved"
00:23:27.540,00:23:30.750,"in this form as a two dimensional Fast Fourier Transform"
00:23:30.750,00:23:32.730,"and then when you wanna look at the picture again,"
00:23:32.730,00:23:36.390,"the computer simply inverts the transform."
00:23:36.390,00:23:38.880,"There are so many applications for FFTs"
00:23:38.880,00:23:42.600,"from solving differential equations to radar and sonar,"
00:23:42.600,00:23:45.780,"studying crystal structures, WiFi and 5G."
00:23:45.780,00:23:49.800,"Basically all kinds of signal processing use FFTs"
00:23:49.800,00:23:52.950,"and that's why mathematician Gilbert Strang called the FFT"
00:23:52.950,00:23:56.760,"the most important numerical algorithm of our lifetime."
00:23:56.760,00:23:59.340,"If only it had become more widely adopted"
00:23:59.340,00:24:00.900,"after Gauss discovered it,"
00:24:00.900,00:24:03.810,"the FFT may have even more dramatically"
00:24:03.810,00:24:05.703,"transformed our world."
00:24:11.130,00:24:13.320,"Now I don't think Gauss could ever have imagined"
00:24:13.320,00:24:15.390,"how important the FFT would be,"
00:24:15.390,00:24:18.360,"just as most people don't think about the cumulative impact"
00:24:18.360,00:24:19.890,"of their life's work."
00:24:19.890,00:24:23.040,"You know in an average career, you work 40 hours a week,"
00:24:23.040,00:24:25.680,"50 weeks a year for 40 years"
00:24:25.680,00:24:28.890,"and that works out to 80,000 hours."
00:24:28.890,00:24:32.130,"It means that your career might be your biggest opportunity"
00:24:32.130,00:24:33.870,"to make a difference in the world."
00:24:33.870,00:24:36.750,"So what do you wanna do with all that time?"
00:24:36.750,00:24:40.290,"Now the name of this video sponsor is 80,000 Hours"
00:24:40.290,00:24:42.600,"referencing the amount of impact you can have,"
00:24:42.600,00:24:44.430,"the amount of hours you spend at work,"
00:24:44.430,00:24:46.370,"and they are not selling anything."
00:24:46.370,00:24:48.960,"80,000 Hours is a nonprofit that helps people"
00:24:48.960,00:24:52.050,"find fulfilling careers that make a positive impact."
00:24:52.050,00:24:55.020,"The typical advice from career centers or aptitude tests"
00:24:55.020,00:24:56.790,"really just focuses on finding a job"
00:24:56.790,00:24:58.650,"that fits your personal preferences."
00:24:58.650,00:25:01.530,"But what if you care more about doing good?"
00:25:01.530,00:25:03.000,"Well, they won't really know what to tell you"
00:25:03.000,00:25:04.710,"besides a few well known professions"
00:25:04.710,00:25:06.930,"like being a doctor or a teacher."
00:25:06.930,00:25:10.380,"When I finished college, I knew I liked filmmaking, teaching"
00:25:10.380,00:25:13.620,"and science and that I wanted to have a big positive impact"
00:25:13.620,00:25:17.100,"but YouTube didn't exist yet and so I honestly had no idea"
00:25:17.100,00:25:18.420,"what I was gonna do."
00:25:18.420,00:25:21.318,"Now I feel really fortunate to be able to do something"
00:25:21.318,00:25:23.220,"every day that I both enjoy"
00:25:23.220,00:25:25.830,"and which makes a positive impact on the world."
00:25:25.830,00:25:28.320,"So believe me, there are a lot of things out there"
00:25:28.320,00:25:31.590,"that you can do and 80,000 Hours offers tons of resources"
