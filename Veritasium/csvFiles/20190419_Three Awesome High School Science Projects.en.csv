00:00:00.030,00:00:03.440,"By the end of this video, one of these three high school seniors"
00:00:03.440,00:00:08.720,"will be awarded two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for their original scientific research"
00:00:08.720,00:00:12.080,"now the way this went down was, Regeneron the sponsor of this video,"
00:00:12.080,00:00:17.280,"invited me out to Washington DC for the awards gala of the Regeneron Science Talent Search"
00:00:17.280,00:00:22.400,"this is the nation's oldest and most prestigious science and math competition for high school seniors"
00:00:22.400,00:00:25.560,"founded and produced by Society for Science &amp; the Public"
00:00:25.560,00:00:29.680,"Here the 40 finalists were honored and the top 10 winners announced"
00:00:29.680,00:00:34.560,"now they couldn't tell me who was going to win because not even they knew beforehand"
00:00:34.560,00:00:40.120,"and that's because the students are judged not only on the strength of their projects but also on interviews"
00:00:40.120,00:00:45.320,"where they are asked very challenging questions about a wide range of scientific topics"
00:00:45.320,00:00:49.520,"so I selected three students to follow and find out more about their projects"
00:00:49.520,00:00:55.120,"just to be clear these were not the top three place winners they are students I picked in advance"
00:00:55.120,00:00:58.720,"but it just so happened that I picked the winner"
00:00:58.720,00:01:00.600,"so can you pick the winner?"
00:01:00.600,00:01:02.480,"let's meet the candidates"
00:01:02.480,00:01:05.640,"Ronak Roy redesigned the Phoroptor"
00:01:05.640,00:01:09.040,"that's the device used to determine eyeglass prescriptions"
00:01:09.040,00:01:14.880,"it contains dozens of precision glass lenses making it bulky, heavy, expensive"
00:01:14.880,00:01:17.960,"and a design that hasn't really changed in two hundred years"
00:01:17.960,00:01:23.280,"I wanted to make something that you know could could fit the greater than half the Earth's population"
00:01:23.280,00:01:28.600,"who you know can't just you know drive down to an optometrist office and just get a prescription"
00:01:28.600,00:01:30.000,"so can we see it?"
00:01:30.000,00:01:31.440,"oh yeah absolutely"
00:01:31.440,00:01:34.040,"so this is this is my child here"
00:01:34.040,00:01:37.920,"this is this is the portable Phoroptor"
00:01:37.920,00:01:40.720,"as you can see it has the the liquid lens"
00:01:40.720,00:01:47.280,"that is actually the one responsible for replacing the dozens of precisely machine lenses here"
00:01:47.280,00:01:49.360,"so how does this liquid lens work"
00:01:49.360,00:01:53.720,"Right. So it has a droplet of a polar substance like water"
00:01:53.720,00:01:57.520,"And a droplet of a non-polar substance like like a mineral oil"
00:01:57.520,00:01:59.720,"when you apply a voltage across of it"
00:01:59.720,00:02:03.480,"the voltage will cause the polar substance to actually change its shape"
00:02:03.480,00:02:07.000,"and go hug or repel the surfaces of the lens"
00:02:07.000,00:02:10.680,"so by changing the shape of the bubble you change the way light refracts through it"
00:02:10.680,00:02:13.080,"as it passes through that the two glass windows"
00:02:13.080,00:02:16.000,"and therefore you know you're changing the focal length of the lens"
00:02:16.000,00:02:17.360,"you you made an app?"
00:02:17.360,00:02:18.120,"yeah I did"
00:02:18.120,00:02:22.320,"so the screen you're looking at which is runs on an app on my smartphone"
00:02:22.320,00:02:26.320,"displays a test chart and runs an algorithm to actually do the refraction"
00:02:26.320,00:02:27.960,"I mean those are pretty small letters"
00:02:27.960,00:02:32.520,"those three static glass lenses are able to make it so the light coming from the phone"
00:02:32.520,00:02:35.880,"are projected to a virtual distance of that twenty feet"
00:02:35.880,00:02:41.600,"so it's basically simulating that that test room but you know optically instead"
00:02:41.600,00:02:45.800,"so the way it works is there's an algorithm running on the smartphone app"
00:02:45.800,00:02:49.800,"that generates pairs of lens voltages for the patient to compare"
00:02:49.800,00:02:54.920,"and in order to switch between the two lens voltages the patient can click a button on a pair of headphones"
00:02:54.920,00:02:57.720,"so you can click once to toggle between the two"
00:02:57.720,00:03:01.240,"and once you've found which of the two is the best"
00:03:01.240,00:03:02.240,"okay that's better"
00:03:02.240,00:03:03.960,"all right so you can double click it"
00:03:03.960,00:03:09.200,"and it will you know indicate to the algorithm that it indeed is the best and generate the next pair"
00:03:09.200,00:03:10.640,"yeah I think it got worse"
00:03:10.640,00:03:11.960,"yeah um so..."
00:03:11.960,00:03:12.800,"And I'm gonna click?"
00:03:12.800,00:03:13.640,"Uh.. Yeah"
00:03:13.640,00:03:16.400,"Okay that's better but it's not the best I've seen"
00:03:16.400,00:03:21.520,"the algorithm will basically cycle through this lens voltage pair generation process"
00:03:21.520,00:03:24.800,"this is like night and day. Like, it's not like it's not even a question"
00:03:24.800,00:03:28.560,"until it zeros in on on the one voltage that works the best for you"
00:03:28.560,00:03:33.240,"okay okay that or... Oh yes"
00:03:33.240,00:03:34.080,"Test complete"
00:03:34.080,00:03:36.160,"all right awesome would you like to know"
00:03:36.160,00:03:38.240,"I would love to know what my eyesight is like"
00:03:38.240,00:03:42.600,"all right so I calculated negative 1.25 diopters"
00:03:42.600,00:03:47.480,"um which is roughly in the range that most people with slight nearsightedness would have"
00:03:48.520,00:03:52.480,"Ana Humphrey wanted to find hidden exoplanets with math"
00:03:52.480,00:03:57.240,"the Kepler space telescope has been the most prolific planet finder to date"
00:03:57.240,00:04:03.400,"detecting over 2,000 exoplanets by measuring a dip in their host stars brightness when they pass in front of it"
00:04:03.400,00:04:08.320,"but what happens if the planet passes just above or just below the star"
00:04:08.320,00:04:11.040,"Also, what if that planet is really small?"
00:04:11.040,00:04:15.120,"those little tiny shadows are really hard to pull out and you've got a lot of noise"
00:04:15.120,00:04:19.040,"a further challenge is that the Kepler mission only ran for four years"
00:04:19.040,00:04:24.320,"that means our absolute limit is it's really hard to find anything that takes longer than four years to orbit"
00:04:24.320,00:04:26.520,"To identify planets Kepler might have missed,"
00:04:26.520,00:04:29.400,"Ana looked at existing multi planetary systems"
00:04:29.400,00:04:33.800,"and calculated whether additional planets could fit in between the ones we observed"
00:04:33.800,00:04:35.800,"without disturbing their orbits"
00:04:35.800,00:04:40.760,"I imagine that you already have some sort of planets here"
00:04:40.760,00:04:42.840,"so we're going to call this planet X"
00:04:42.840,00:04:44.360,"so what are these two lines?"
00:04:44.360,00:04:47.400,"this line here is the same as this outer line"
00:04:47.400,00:04:52.040,"it's how close your imaginary planet can get to your outer planet"
00:04:52.040,00:04:56.240,"and this line here is your a-x-min"
00:04:56.240,00:05:01.600,"so it's how close your imaginary planet can get to your inner planet so it's this line here"
00:05:01.600,00:05:07.120,"we have this region of stability given the extremes of where we can put a planet"
00:05:07.120,00:05:10.560,"and we have the maximum mass you can fit there"
00:05:10.560,00:05:14.160,"and anything in this area here"
00:05:14.160,00:05:16.040,"sort of shade around our label"
00:05:16.040,00:05:18.600,"anything between these two graphs"
00:05:18.600,00:05:22.760,"is a combination of a planet's mass and a location of the planet"
00:05:22.760,00:05:26.720,"that we could fit in between the two we know about and maintain a stable system"
00:05:26.720,00:05:27.600,"cool"
00:05:27.600,00:05:28.400,"yeah"
00:05:28.400,00:05:34.200,"Now the question everyone will ask you is like what's to say that this planet really exists"
00:05:34.200,00:05:36.040,"as opposed to you just making up stuff?"
00:05:36.040,00:05:38.480,"So the assumption that I made going into my research"
00:05:38.480,00:05:43.640,"was that systems are going to try to have as many planets packed in as possible"
00:05:43.640,00:05:46.360,"this is called the packed planetary system hypothesis"
00:05:46.360,00:05:50.280,"there are 560 locations where we could fit additional planets"
00:05:50.280,00:05:52.400,"so quite a few"
00:05:52.400,00:05:54.680,"how might we go about actually finding them?"
00:05:54.680,00:05:59.720,"One of the ways you could go about doing this is by doing something called folding the data"
00:05:59.720,00:06:04.480,"so let's say we figure out that a planet should have an orbital period of about one month"
00:06:05.160,00:06:10.400,"we have a year's worth of data and we fold that data in twelve and get it to line up just right"
00:06:10.400,00:06:14.440,"we can get it so those transit signals actually layer on top of each other"
00:06:14.440,00:06:19.320,"and then we get a larger signal as a that you know we can find"
00:06:19.320,00:06:22.920,"as opposed to the really small signals that sort of get lost in the noise"
00:06:22.920,00:06:25.360,"Do you want to introduce yourself? What's your name, what do you do?"
00:06:24.040,00:06:24.560,"Sure"
00:06:25.360,00:06:27.680,"Yeah. My name is Anjali Chadha."
00:06:27.680,00:06:31.600,"I am a senior at DuPont Manual High School in Louisville, Kentucky"
00:06:31.600,00:06:33.840,"What is.. this?"
00:06:33.840,00:06:34.840,"That"
00:06:35.800,00:06:39.960,"Anjali was concerned with dangerous contaminants in drinking water"
00:06:39.960,00:06:42.440,"this is a prototype of my arsenic sensor"
00:06:42.440,00:06:46.760,"so you want to load a water sample right here in this compartment"
00:06:46.760,00:06:49.840,"the whole process starts with an automated chemical reaction"
00:06:49.840,00:06:54.760,"so there are a bunch of chemical reagents that sit in this compartment above the water sample"
00:06:54.760,00:06:57.160,"so the first reagent is tartaric acid"
00:06:57.160,00:07:01.080,"next is a combination of salts it's called mono potassium sulfate"
00:07:01.080,00:07:03.040,"and the third is zinc"
00:07:03.040,00:07:07.560,"Arsenic is an element that's never found freely but it's always bound to other elements"
00:07:07.560,00:07:12.200,"so basically that chemical reaction will help to free up all of the arsenic"
00:07:12.200,00:07:17.280,"and then the arsenic content changes into a gaseous form of arsine gas"
00:07:17.280,00:07:20.800,"and that's the best detectable form of arsenic basically"
00:07:20.800,00:07:23.840,"so what happens after that gas is formed"
00:07:23.840,00:07:27.480,"is that there is a test strip and it's covered in mercury bromide"
00:07:27.480,00:07:31.720,"which oxidizes in response to the arsenic and then changes color"
00:07:31.720,00:07:33.880,"So it's actually on a gradient scale."
00:07:33.880,00:07:37.400,"If there's very little arsenic content then it just changes to a light color"
00:07:37.400,00:07:40.480,"and if there's a lot changes a dark color and everything in between"
00:07:40.480,00:07:44.560,"right so what I then did was write an image processing algorithm"
00:07:44.560,00:07:47.840,"using some embedded electronic devices"
00:07:47.840,00:07:52.920,"specifically this device called an ArduCAM it's just an embedded camera"
00:07:52.920,00:07:58.200,"and essentially the camera takes a picture of that test strip after it's changed color"
00:07:58.200,00:08:02.560,"it then pulls out all of the color values of the test strip"
00:08:02.560,00:08:05.200,"and converts them into concentration data"
00:08:05.200,00:08:09.120,"so I wrote some mathematical models that kind of made that conversion"
00:08:09.120,00:08:13.280,"and then the last kind of piece of the puzzle is that there is this device"
00:08:13.280,00:08:15.680,"it's a microcontroller called a particle electron"
00:08:15.680,00:08:17.960,"and it's connected to this cellular antenna"
00:08:17.960,00:08:21.040,"so that the data is instantaneously transmitted to the cloud"
00:08:21.040,00:08:23.200,"the real advantages of that is that"
00:08:23.200,00:08:27.040,"several people would be able to access the data collected from one sensor"
00:08:27.040,00:08:28.960,"whether it's people in the same community"
00:08:28.960,00:08:32.880,"who want to kind of have that information and knowledge about their water sources"
00:08:32.880,00:08:37.440,"or whether it's people in research organizations who are trying to really learn more"
00:08:37.440,00:08:41.120,"learn what to test learn what to improve and what sites to really work on"
00:08:41.120,00:08:44.840,"so those are kind of the reasons why I chose to do that"
00:08:44.840,00:08:46.840,"So now the moment of truth"
00:08:46.840,00:08:51.960,"which one of these high school students will win two hundred and fifty thousand dollars?"
00:08:51.960,00:08:56.200,"now I should point out that all 40 finalists each receive at least $25,000,"
00:08:56.200,00:08:58.120,"the top ten receiving more than that"
00:08:59.080,00:09:06.440,"the first-place winner and recipient of a 250 thousand dollar award..."
00:09:07.520,00:09:13.280,"from TC Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia Ana Humphrey"
00:09:25.580,00:09:30.440,"congratulations to Ana Humphrey on winning this year's Regeneron Science Talent Search"
00:09:32.560,00:09:37.440,"if you know any bright American high school students please consider sending them this video"
00:09:37.440,00:09:40.640,"it could be their turn next up on that stage"
00:09:40.640,00:09:43.120,"and if you are an American high school student,"
00:09:43.120,00:09:44.600,"think about these numbers:"
00:09:44.600,00:09:48.600,"around 3.6 million students graduate high school in the US each year"
00:09:48.600,00:09:53.040,"but only 2,000 or so applied the Regeneron Science Talent Search"
00:09:53.040,00:09:59.640,"that means if you enter your science research project you have a 1 in 50 shot of winning at least $25,000"
00:09:59.640,00:10:03.880,"I mean when else in high school do you get the opportunity to get such a financial boost"
00:10:03.880,00:10:07.160,"and receive recognition for your ability in science and math"
00:10:07.160,00:10:10.160,"this opportunity could literally be life-changing"
00:10:10.160,00:10:16.040,"so take the next step click the link in the description and sign up to receive updates about the competition"
00:10:16.040,00:10:20.800,"entries are open to all American high school seniors for next year starting June 1st"
00:10:20.800,00:10:22.440,"and good luck"
00:10:22.440,00:10:25.040,"Now a little epilogue about Ana"
00:10:25.040,00:10:29.080,"you know I asked her what inspired her to pursue this research in the first place"
00:10:29.080,00:10:30.360,"and she told me"
00:10:30.360,00:10:33.400,"researchers at Caltech had predicted this ninth planet"
00:10:33.400,00:10:35.240,"do you know what the researchers names were?"
00:10:35.240,00:10:38.520,"Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin. I always mess up his last name"
00:10:39.280,00:10:43.200,"So I took her work and showed it to Konstantin Batygin"
00:10:43.200,00:10:46.200,"when i first looked at this,"
00:10:46.200,00:10:50.680,"I was blown away by the fact that this was a high school student"
00:10:50.680,00:10:57.440,"Right, I mean this is this is done at the very least at the level of a senior undergraduate"
00:10:57.440,00:10:59.400,"maybe a graduate level student"
00:10:59.400,00:11:01.590,"Right? I mean, it's a PhD level student"
00:11:01.590,00:11:05.440,"and finally when I was watching the black hole press conference the other morning,"
00:11:05.440,00:11:09.440,"we have seen and taken a picture of a black hole"
00:11:14.960,00:11:17.520,"who should be in the audience asking a question?"
00:11:18.160,00:11:21.400,"Ana Humphrey. It's like science is in her blood."
00:11:21.400,00:11:25.680,"I expect to see much more in the future from this very talented young scientist"
00:11:25.680,00:11:27.280,"Congrats again, Ana"
