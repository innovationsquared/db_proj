00:00:00.000,00:00:03.929,"Most people don't know how bicycles actually work."
00:00:03.929,00:00:04.645,"- [Off screen] Let's try it again."
00:00:04.645,00:00:07.611,"So we modified this bike to prove it."
00:00:11.850,00:00:14.100,"This video was sponsored by KiwiCo."
00:00:14.100,00:00:16.050,"More about them at the end of the show."
00:00:17.630,00:00:20.120,"- When you're riding a bike and you want to turn left,"
00:00:20.120,00:00:21.610,"I think most people just imagine"
00:00:21.610,00:00:23.840,"you turn the handlebars to the left."
00:00:23.840,00:00:26.490,"This is a bike to test whether that is true."
00:00:26.490,00:00:29.020,"And it's made by my friend Rick here."
00:00:29.020,00:00:31.490,"and he's got a radio controller that allows him"
00:00:31.490,00:00:35.040,"to lock out the steering to one side."
00:00:35.040,00:00:36.730,"So, what he's gonna do is as I'm biking,"
00:00:36.730,00:00:38.900,"he's gonna pick whether I can turn"
00:00:38.900,00:00:40.670,"either to the left or to the right."
00:00:40.670,00:00:42.210,"So, go for it."
00:00:42.210,00:00:43.800,"- [Rick] I'm giving it a left turn."
00:00:43.800,00:00:45.140,"It pulls the pin out,"
00:00:45.140,00:00:48.200,"but you can see that you can still fully steer"
00:00:48.200,00:00:49.080,"after I've pulled the pin out."
00:00:49.080,00:00:50.473,"I've armed it."
00:00:51.480,00:00:52.390,"There's where it locks. - OK"
00:00:52.390,00:00:55.110,"Now, that that's when your LED comes on"
00:00:55.110,00:00:56.380,"and that just says turn that way."
00:00:56.380,00:00:57.658,"- Turn left. - Yeah"
00:00:57.658,00:01:00.070,"And if I try to turn right, I can't."
00:01:00.070,00:01:01.280,"And if I try to turn left-"
00:01:01.280,00:01:02.113,"- You can."
00:01:02.113,00:01:02.946,"- I can."
00:01:02.946,00:01:03.925,"So the question is"
00:01:03.925,00:01:07.436,"can I successfully execute this left-hand turn?"
00:01:07.436,00:01:08.269,"Should we give it a shot?"
00:01:08.269,00:01:09.910,"I mean, he's not gonna tell me whether it's left or right,"
00:01:09.910,00:01:11.710,"so I have to look at the LED to know"
00:01:11.710,00:01:13.770,"which way I can still turn."
00:01:13.770,00:01:15.423,"- [Rick] You let me know when you're ready."
00:01:16.880,00:01:17.713,"- Okay."
00:01:19.296,00:01:20.250,"(exclaims)"
00:01:20.250,00:01:22.170,"No!"
00:01:22.170,00:01:23.750,"That was meant to be a turn to the right"
00:01:23.750,00:01:25.500,"but there was no chance in hell."
00:01:25.500,00:01:26.553,"Left."
00:01:26.553,00:01:27.830,"(exclaims)"
00:01:27.830,00:01:28.663,"Right."
00:01:32.300,00:01:33.181,"All right."
00:01:33.181,00:01:35.460,"(exclaims)"
00:01:35.460,00:01:37.580,"Right, right, right!"
00:01:37.580,00:01:39.100,"God!"
00:01:39.100,00:01:41.900,"- If you look closely, you can see the problem."
00:01:41.900,00:01:44.150,"Here, I'm trying to turn right"
00:01:44.150,00:01:47.930,"but steering that way puts me off balance."
00:01:47.930,00:01:49.690,"If you could ride this bicycle,"
00:01:49.690,00:01:51.950,"you would find it's impossible to turn left"
00:01:51.950,00:01:53.680,"without first steering right"
00:01:53.680,00:01:55.242,"and it's impossible to turn right"
00:01:55.242,00:01:57.563,"without first steering left."
00:01:58.410,00:02:00.410,"This seems wrong."
00:02:00.410,00:02:02.008,"I think most people believe you turn a bike"
00:02:02.008,00:02:03.790,"simply by pointing the handlebars"
00:02:03.790,00:02:05.500,"in the direction you want to go."
00:02:05.500,00:02:08.550,"After all, this is how you drive a car."
00:02:08.550,00:02:10.950,"Point the front wheels any direction you like"
00:02:10.950,00:02:13.350,"and the car just goes that way."
00:02:13.350,00:02:14.828,"But the difference with a bicycle"
00:02:14.828,00:02:18.500,"is steering doesn't just affect the direction you're headed;"
00:02:18.500,00:02:21.690,"it also affects your balance."
00:02:21.690,00:02:24.030,"Imagine you want to make a right turn"
00:02:24.030,00:02:26.600,"so you steer the handlebars to the right."
00:02:26.600,00:02:28.630,"What you've done is effectively"
00:02:28.630,00:02:31.180,"steered the bike out from under you."
00:02:31.180,00:02:33.860,"So now you're leaning to the left"
00:02:33.860,00:02:36.209,"and the ground puts a force on the bike to the left"
00:02:36.209,00:02:38.040,"so the only way not to fall"
00:02:38.040,00:02:40.310,"is to steer the bike to the left."
00:02:40.310,00:02:42.860,"You have made a left turn."
00:02:42.860,00:02:44.810,"If you really wanted to turn right,"
00:02:44.810,00:02:47.310,"you first have to counter-steer to the left"
00:02:47.310,00:02:50.890,"so you can lean right into the turn."
00:02:50.890,00:02:54.320,"This is something anyone who rides a bike knows intuitively"
00:02:54.320,00:02:55.970,"but not explicitly."
00:02:55.970,00:02:57.250,"- Turn left!"
00:02:57.250,00:02:59.180,"- Film someone riding a bike towards you"
00:02:59.180,00:03:01.290,"and tell them which direction to turn"
00:03:01.290,00:03:03.100,"and you will find that they counter-steer"
00:03:03.100,00:03:04.572,"without even thinking about it."
00:03:04.572,00:03:05.780,"- Hard left!"
00:03:08.970,00:03:10.640,"When you're riding a bike,"
00:03:10.640,00:03:13.460,"it's exactly the same as what we call an inverted pendulum"
00:03:13.460,00:03:16.200,"or balancing a broomstick on your hand."
00:03:16.200,00:03:18.770,"If I'm balancing it and I just start walking toward you,"
00:03:18.770,00:03:21.150,"it will always fall away from you."
00:03:21.150,00:03:23.020,"If I want to walk towards you, it's easy enough to do"
00:03:23.020,00:03:24.720,"and people inherently know how to do it."
00:03:24.720,00:03:28.400,"If I pull it backward, I can now start walking that way."
00:03:28.400,00:03:32.710,"I have to initiate the lean to turn into it."
00:03:32.710,00:03:34.660,"- If you want to move the pendulum somewhere,"
00:03:34.660,00:03:37.970,"you first move the base in the opposite direction."
00:03:37.970,00:03:39.960,"And now the pendulum is leaning"
00:03:39.960,00:03:41.430,"in the direction you want to go"
00:03:41.430,00:03:44.350,"so you can move with it."
00:03:44.350,00:03:47.100,"And it's the same with a unicycle."
00:03:47.100,00:03:48.510,"In order to go forward,"
00:03:48.510,00:03:50.260,"first, you have to peddle back."
00:03:50.260,00:03:52.030,"So, you're leaning forward"
00:03:52.030,00:03:54.710,"and then you can go forward with it."
00:03:54.710,00:03:56.270,"- Everything you're doing on a unicycle"
00:03:56.270,00:03:59.120,"is all about keeping that contact patch"
00:03:59.120,00:04:01.710,"right where it needs to be relative to you."
00:04:01.710,00:04:03.380,"You're balancing the broomstick."
00:04:03.380,00:04:04.860,"It's just that on a unicycle,"
00:04:04.860,00:04:08.220,"you do the longitudinal balance with the pedals"
00:04:08.220,00:04:10.810,"and you do the lateral balance, the side to side,"
00:04:10.810,00:04:11.720,"the same as you do with a bike."
00:04:11.720,00:04:14.650,"You essentially- sorta, small counter-steer to get that weight,"
00:04:14.650,00:04:16.660,"to get the contact patch out,"
00:04:16.660,00:04:19.350,"and then you can pedal and bring it under you."
00:04:19.350,00:04:20.390,"- Now I should point out"
00:04:20.390,00:04:22.570,"that sometimes when the steering locked,"
00:04:22.570,00:04:25.140,"we just happened to be leaning in the right direction"
00:04:25.140,00:04:26.347,"to execute the turn."
00:04:26.347,00:04:27.960,"- Right, right, right, right, right!"
00:04:27.960,00:04:29.390,"Right, right, right, right."
00:04:29.390,00:04:30.540,"- [Off Screen] Oh, managed it!"
00:04:30.540,00:04:31.950,"- Essentially by sheer luck,"
00:04:31.950,00:04:33.200,"we had counter-steered"
00:04:33.200,00:04:36.040,"before that side of the handlebars locked out."
00:04:36.040,00:04:37.760,"Now, I can keep going."
00:04:37.760,00:04:38.830,"- [Rick] Yeah, but don't turn left"
00:04:38.830,00:04:39.990,"or you're gonna be screwed."
00:04:39.990,00:04:42.140,"- I can't turn left."
00:04:42.140,00:04:43.850,"What's interesting about this is it shows"
00:04:43.850,00:04:45.970,"that you can still ride the bike perfectly well, right?"
00:04:45.970,00:04:48.730,"It's just you can't turn left."
00:04:48.730,00:04:52.216,"The funny thing is that you couldn't initiate the turn."
00:04:52.216,00:04:54.700,"I mean, the wild takeaway is that"
00:04:54.700,00:04:57.680,"steering is not just for turning the bike;"
00:04:57.680,00:04:58.890,"steering is for balancing."
00:04:58.890,00:05:00.250,"- That's exactly right."
00:05:00.250,00:05:03.820,"- Why is it hard to balance on a stationary bike?"
00:05:03.820,00:05:04.830,"I think most people believe"
00:05:04.830,00:05:06.690,"it's because the wheels aren't spinning"
00:05:06.690,00:05:09.060,"so there's no gyroscopic effect,"
00:05:09.060,00:05:10.890,"but that's not it."
00:05:10.890,00:05:12.760,"The truth is you use steering"
00:05:12.760,00:05:14.830,"to keep the bike underneath you"
00:05:14.830,00:05:17.820,"but steering doesn't work when you're stationary."
00:05:17.820,00:05:19.140,"Your balance comes not so much"
00:05:19.140,00:05:21.610,"from how you position your body over the bike,"
00:05:21.610,00:05:25.270,"but by how you steer the bike to keep it underneath you."
00:05:25.270,00:05:26.620,"Even when going straight,"
00:05:26.620,00:05:29.330,"you're constantly making small steering adjustments"
00:05:29.330,00:05:31.200,"to maintain balance."
00:05:31.200,00:05:32.650,"- You're moving the contact patch"
00:05:32.650,00:05:33.770,"of the front wheel under you."
00:05:33.770,00:05:34.810,"You're doing exactly what you do"
00:05:34.810,00:05:36.960,"when you balance a broomstick on your hand."
00:05:37.990,00:05:39.840,"- So, if the rider is responsible"
00:05:39.840,00:05:41.890,"for steering the bike to keep it balanced,"
00:05:41.890,00:05:45.210,"how do bikes without riders stay upright?"
00:05:45.210,00:05:47.740,"As long as a bike is moving with sufficient speed,"
00:05:47.740,00:05:50.558,"it can keep coasting indefinitely."
00:05:50.558,00:05:52.560,"I first became aware of this phenomenon"
00:05:52.560,00:05:54.610,"through the great videos by MinutePhysics,"
00:05:54.610,00:05:56.650,"which inspired me to make this video."
00:05:56.650,00:05:58.750,"You should definitely check them out."
00:05:58.750,00:06:00.210,"But it turned out the ground"
00:06:00.210,00:06:03.600,"where we went to test this effect was really bumpy,"
00:06:03.600,00:06:06.940,"but the bike still manages to absorb all these perturbations"
00:06:06.940,00:06:08.880,"and remain stable."
00:06:08.880,00:06:10.990,"So, how does it do this?"
00:06:10.990,00:06:13.310,"I think most people believe it's the wheels spinning"
00:06:13.310,00:06:15.810,"that creates some sort of gyroscopic effect"
00:06:15.810,00:06:17.920,"that resists falling over"
00:06:17.920,00:06:21.300,"just like in this demonstration of gyroscopic precession."
00:06:21.300,00:06:22.530,"Yhe wheel stays upright"
00:06:22.530,00:06:25.340,"even though gravity is pulling it down."
00:06:25.340,00:06:28.320,"But this is not why bikes are stable."
00:06:28.320,00:06:29.290,"Just watch what happens"
00:06:29.290,00:06:31.390,"when we lock the handlebars completely"
00:06:31.390,00:06:33.430,"so you can only go straight ahead."
00:06:33.430,00:06:34.880,"- Locked out, locked out."
00:06:34.880,00:06:35.713,"Whoa!"
00:06:37.570,00:06:40.200,"- All that is happening is the steering is locked."
00:06:40.200,00:06:41.120,"You just got to ride it."
00:06:41.120,00:06:41.953,"You don't have to turn."
00:06:41.953,00:06:43.360,"You just ride."
00:06:43.360,00:06:44.193,"Letting go."
00:06:44.193,00:06:46.403,"- Some people tried going really fast."
00:06:48.315,00:06:50.898,"(group laughs)"
00:06:52.200,00:06:55.800,"Others experimented with extreme balancing techniques."
00:06:55.800,00:06:57.500,"- He's leaning. Don't go too fast!"
00:06:58.882,00:07:01.465,"(group laughs)"
00:07:02.957,00:07:04.380,"- But even with the gyroscopic"
00:07:04.380,00:07:05.530,"effect of the wheels,"
00:07:05.530,00:07:07.470,"no one was able to keep the bike upright"
00:07:07.470,00:07:09.077,"for more than a few seconds."
00:07:09.077,00:07:11.540,"(crowd exclaims)"
00:07:11.540,00:07:13.370,"- This is not safe for a second."
00:07:13.370,00:07:15.040,"- It is just as hard to balance"
00:07:15.040,00:07:16.980,"on a bike with locked steering"
00:07:16.980,00:07:19.000,"as it is to balance on a stationary bike."
00:07:19.000,00:07:21.270,"- No, this one is impossible."
00:07:21.270,00:07:23.260,"- Because you can't steer the bike"
00:07:23.260,00:07:24.770,"back under you."
00:07:24.770,00:07:27.177,"The real reason bicycles are stable without riders"
00:07:27.177,00:07:31.420,"is because they're cleverly designed to steer themselves."
00:07:31.420,00:07:33.350,"If they start falling to one side,"
00:07:33.350,00:07:35.680,"the handlebars turn in that direction"
00:07:35.680,00:07:38.600,"to steer the wheels back underneath them."
00:07:38.600,00:07:40.200,"At least three mechanisms"
00:07:40.200,00:07:43.140,"are responsible for a bike's corrective steering."
00:07:43.140,00:07:45.960,"The first is that due to the angle of the front fork,"
00:07:45.960,00:07:48.820,"the steering axis intersects the ground"
00:07:48.820,00:07:52.060,"in front of where the wheel touches the ground."
00:07:52.060,00:07:54.050,"So, if the bike starts leaning to the left,"
00:07:54.050,00:07:55.787,"the force from the ground on the tire"
00:07:55.787,00:07:58.330,"turns the wheel to the left."
00:07:58.330,00:07:59.730,"If the bike starts leaning right,"
00:07:59.730,00:08:02.760,"the force from the ground pushes the wheel to the right."
00:08:02.760,00:08:06.240,"The front wheel of a bicycle is essentially a caster wheel,"
00:08:06.240,00:08:09.480,"like those you find on strollers or shopping carts."
00:08:09.480,00:08:10.930,"Whichever way you drive them,"
00:08:10.930,00:08:14.740,"the wheel falls in line and rolls in the same direction."
00:08:14.740,00:08:17.380,"The second reason for a bike's corrective steering"
00:08:17.380,00:08:18.550,"is that the center of mass"
00:08:18.550,00:08:20.490,"of the handlebars and front wheel"
00:08:20.490,00:08:23.810,"are located slightly in front of the steering axis."
00:08:23.810,00:08:25.580,"So, when the bike leans left,"
00:08:25.580,00:08:28.240,"their weight pushes the front wheel to the left."
00:08:28.240,00:08:31.203,"If the bike leans right, their weight steers to the right."
00:08:32.310,00:08:35.220,"And the third mechanism is a gyroscopic effect"
00:08:35.220,00:08:38.040,"but it doesn't keep the bike upright directly;"
00:08:38.040,00:08:40.020,"it just helps steer."
00:08:40.020,00:08:41.180,"If you have a gyroscope"
00:08:41.180,00:08:43.470,"and you push down on the left-hand side,"
00:08:43.470,00:08:45.700,"the gyro will turn left."
00:08:45.700,00:08:49.400,"If you push down on the right side, it will turn right."
00:08:49.400,00:08:52.120,"This is known as gyroscopic precession."
00:08:52.120,00:08:54.170,"It seems as though the force you apply"
00:08:54.170,00:08:57.910,"takes effect 90 degrees from where you applied it."
00:08:57.910,00:09:01.720,"So, bikes are stable primarily because of steering."
00:09:01.720,00:09:05.300,"They have built-in mechanisms for steering themselves."
00:09:05.300,00:09:07.810,"In fact, you don't need all three mechanisms"
00:09:07.810,00:09:09.690,"to create a stable bike."
00:09:09.690,00:09:12.520,"Researchers created this weird-looking bicycle"
00:09:12.520,00:09:13.880,"to prove a point."
00:09:13.880,00:09:15.780,"It has no gyroscopic effect"
00:09:15.780,00:09:17.700,"thanks to counter-rotating wheels"
00:09:17.700,00:09:19.750,"above the wheels that touch the floor."
00:09:19.750,00:09:22.080,"Plus, there is no caster effect"
00:09:22.080,00:09:23.920,"because the front wheel touches the floor"
00:09:23.920,00:09:26.350,"in front of the steering axis."
00:09:26.350,00:09:30.080,"But this bike is made stable by its mass distribution,"
00:09:30.080,00:09:31.610,"the force of gravity on which"
00:09:31.610,00:09:34.433,"steers it in the direction of any lean."
00:09:35.350,00:09:37.340,"Understanding how bicycles work"
00:09:37.340,00:09:40.080,"is still an active area of research."
00:09:40.080,00:09:42.100,"There is a program you can use to input"
00:09:42.100,00:09:43.770,"all the different bicycle parameters"
00:09:43.770,00:09:47.650,"and see the range of speeds over which it is self-stable."
00:09:47.650,00:09:50.580,"And this research is leading to better bikes."
00:09:50.580,00:09:53.300,"This prototype has a smart motor in the handlebars"
00:09:53.300,00:09:55.300,"to actively help steer,"
00:09:55.300,00:09:58.550,"keeping the bike upright even at low speeds."
00:09:58.550,00:10:00.650,"I guess it's fitting that we are still"
00:10:00.650,00:10:02.630,"learning new things about bicycles"
00:10:02.630,00:10:04.760,"since most of us are able to ride one"
00:10:04.760,00:10:08.936,"without any knowledge of how we're actually doing it."
00:10:08.936,00:10:12.520,"(futuristic sound effects play)"
00:10:12.520,00:10:14.740,"- Hey, this video is sponsored by KiwiCo,"
