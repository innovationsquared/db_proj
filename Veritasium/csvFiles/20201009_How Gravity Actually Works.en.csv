00:00:08.570,00:00:11.940,"This video is sponsored by Caseta by Lutron"
00:00:17.480,00:00:22.000,"According to the general theory of relativity, gravity is not a force."
00:00:22.000,00:00:27.820,"There are no gravitational fields, gravity is kind of an illusion."
00:00:27.820,00:00:36.220,"And in this video, I will prove it to you by blasting off into outer space in 321"
00:00:50.050,00:00:53.820,"Albert Einstein said the happiest thought of his life"
00:00:53.820,00:00:58.740,"was imagining a man falling off the roof of a house."
00:00:58.740,00:01:03.080,"What made Einstein so happy about this wasn't Schadenfreude,"
00:01:03.080,00:01:08.510,"It was the realization that this man, while he was falling wouldn't feel his own weight."
00:01:08.510,00:01:12.220,"He would be weightless and anything he dropped on his way down,"
00:01:12.220,00:01:17.080,"Well, it would remain stationary relative to him or moving in uniform motion."
00:01:18.050,00:01:23.140,"The whole situation would be just like.."
00:01:23.140,00:01:26.850,"If you were in deep space, not near any large masses."
00:01:28.850,00:01:33.370,"With your spaceship at rest or coasting along at constant velocity"
00:01:34.220,00:01:37.370,"Here, you would feel no weight"
00:01:37.370,00:01:45.940,"Objects would remain stationary relative to you or if you give them a push, they would move in a straight line at constant velocity"
00:01:45.940,00:01:50.510,"And you would be the very definition of an inertial observer,"
00:01:50.510,00:01:54.060,"you're not accelerating, not in a gravitational field,"
00:01:54.060,00:01:57.540,"all the laws of physics apply in your reference frame,"
00:01:57.540,00:02:04.220,"meaning there is no experiment, you could do to distinguish your initial reference frame from any other"
00:02:07.020,00:02:09.020,"Now here comes the big leap:"
00:02:09.020,00:02:15.080,"Einstein looks at these two scenarios and says they are equivalent, not just similar"
00:02:15.080,00:02:17.710,"Physically, they are exactly the same thing."
00:02:17.710,00:02:21.600,"Which means man falling from roof is not in a gravitational field."
00:02:21.600,00:02:25.540,"There are no gravitational fields, and he is not accelerating."
00:02:25.540,00:02:29.250,"He is an inertial observer, just like Rocket Man."
00:02:29.250,00:02:35.710,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. I mean, okay, I can see how both of these observers feel weightless."
00:02:35.710,00:02:39.200,"But man falling from roof is clearly in a gravitational field."
00:02:39.200,00:02:41.250,"I mean, he's right next to the Earth."
00:02:41.250,00:02:46.780,"And he's obviously accelerating his speed is increasing by 9.8 meters per second, every second"
00:02:46.780,00:02:50.620,"A fact that will become painfully apparent when he crashes into the ground."
00:02:51.400,00:02:55.020,"I know that these two situations look very different,"
00:02:55.020,00:03:01.000,"but Einstein's equivalence principle tells us the one thing to focus on: the experience of the observer."
00:03:01.400,00:03:05.680,"If they feel weightless than they are in an inertial frame of reference"
00:03:05.680,00:03:09.320,"every bit as good as rocket man's out drifting through deep space."
00:03:09.880,00:03:13.320,"Imagine if Rocket Man coasting along at constant velocity"
00:03:13.320,00:03:18.320," and not paying attention comes upon a planet a long way off in the distance."
00:03:24.680,00:03:30.320,"An external observer might notice that the path of the rocket bends ever so slightly towards the planet."
00:03:30.320,00:03:34.100,"But inside, Rocket Man would remain oblivious."
00:03:34.100,00:03:38.000,"He feels no force, experiences no acceleration"
00:03:38.000,00:03:41.620,"As the rocket gets closer to the planet, it goes faster and faster"
00:03:41.620,00:03:45.580,"But Rocket Man still feels weightless. For him, nothing has changed."
00:03:46.420,00:03:50.920,"So where on this journey would you say the frame of reference changes from inertial to non inertial?"
00:03:50.920,00:03:54.320,"An onboard accelerometer would never even register a blip."
00:03:54.840,00:03:58.240,"He has continued on his inertial path through spacetime"
00:03:59.100,00:04:05.360,"So the logical conclusion is his frame of reference is inertial up until the instant he crashes into the planet."
00:04:11.840,00:04:18.360,"Okay, so how do you explain the curved path of his rocket without gravitational forces or gravitational fields?"
00:04:18.360,00:04:21.440,"The answer is curved spacetime."
00:04:21.440,00:04:28.580,"First focus on rocket man's observation that the whole time he felt like he was moving with constant velocity in a straight line."
00:04:29.180,00:04:32.420,"He was moving in a straight line through spacetime"
00:04:32.420,00:04:36.240,"but space time around massive objects, like planets is curved."
00:04:36.240,00:04:39.800,"So that's why his path appeared curved to a distant observer."
00:04:41.200,00:04:43.680,"Now this isn't as unusual as it seems,"
00:04:43.680,00:04:47.720,"Airplanes, for example, always try to fly the shortest route between cities."
00:04:47.720,00:04:50.060,"Essentially, they just go in a straight line."
00:04:50.060,00:04:55.280,"But since the Earth's surface is curved, the shortest path doesn't look like a straight line."
00:04:55.280,00:04:59.240,"These shortest paths over curved surfaces are called geodesics,"
00:04:59.240,00:05:02.100,"and we use that same word, geodesics,"
00:05:02.100,00:05:06.480,"for the straight line paths followed by inertial observers through curved space time"
00:05:06.900,00:05:08.600,"Here's another analogy."
00:05:08.600,00:05:13.120,"Imagine you and a friend are standing 1000 kilometers apart on the equator."
00:05:13.780,00:05:15.580,"Now you both set off due North."
00:05:16.060,00:05:18.460,"Over time you will come closer together."
00:05:18.460,00:05:21.320,"Ultimately bumping into each other at the North Pole."
00:05:21.320,00:05:28.680,"Itâ€™s as though there was a force pushing you together, but you didn't feel a force and your friend didn't feel a force.\N"
00:05:28.680,00:05:33.120,"Gravity is just like that force, it doesn't actually exist."
00:05:33.840,00:05:40.620,"The real reason for you coming together was that you were both on straight paths, geodesics, on a curved surface."
00:05:42.940,00:05:46.020,"Astronauts on the space station are weightless."
00:05:46.020,00:05:50.520,"That means they too are inertial observers traveling on a geodesic"
00:05:50.980,00:05:58.180,"But the earth curves space time around it, which is why their straight line path appears as a helix."
00:05:58.180,00:06:02.540,"It only looks like a circular orbit if you forget the time dimension."
00:06:02.540,00:06:07.420,"Don't forget, we are all moving through space and time, spacetime"
00:06:09.840,00:06:14.680,"This is the standard bent sheet analogy for curved space time,"
00:06:14.680,00:06:16.900,"but I think this demo is misleading."
00:06:16.900,00:06:20.820,"It allows you to fool yourself into thinking you understand general relativity"
00:06:20.820,00:06:29.440,"when the intuition you're actually drawing on is just that objects like to fall towards the middle of a well due to the gravitational force."
00:06:30.060,00:06:33.740,"But in general relativity, there is no gravitational force."
00:06:33.740,00:06:39.060,"What you should be thinking about is objects traveling on a straight line path through spacetime"
00:06:39.060,00:06:43.440,"It just so happens that spacetime is curved around massive objects,"
00:06:43.440,00:06:47.500,"so that straight line path doesn't look like a straight line."
00:06:48.140,00:06:52.980,"Matter tells spacetime how to curve, and spacetime tells matter how to move."
00:06:56.780,00:06:59.700,"Now let's go back to deep space."
00:06:59.700,00:07:06.360,"What happens if you turn on the rocket thrusters and accelerate at 9.8 meters per second squared?"
00:07:07.700,00:07:15.620,"Well, someone outside would see all objects remain stationary, while the floor of the rocket accelerates into them."
00:07:22.280,00:07:27.100,"Inside the rocket, everything would appear to accelerate down to the ground"
00:07:27.100,00:07:30.580,"and you would feel a force pushing up on your feet,"
00:07:30.580,00:07:34.700,"the same force that's pushing up on you as you watch this video."
00:07:36.200,00:07:40.860,"This situation feels exactly the same as being at rest on the surface of Earth."
00:07:45.780,00:07:47.700,"Cause we are at rest on the surface of Earth."
00:07:49.120,00:07:54.040,"I want to ask you, are you watching this video in an inertial frame of reference?"
00:07:54.660,00:07:56.880,"Well, I mean, do you feel weightless?"
00:07:57.640,00:08:01.220,"No, so you are not an inertial observer."
00:08:01.220,00:08:06.520,"Your situation is exactly the same as someone accelerating on a rocket ship in deep space."
00:08:06.520,00:08:07.540,"And let me be clear,"
00:08:07.540,00:08:12.440,"I don't mean the being at rest and a gravitational field is like accelerating and a rocket."
00:08:12.440,00:08:15.020,"I mean, it is the exact same thing."
00:08:15.020,00:08:18.620,"You are accelerating and there is no gravitational field."
00:08:18.620,00:08:20.440,"Gravitational fields do not exist."
00:08:20.960,00:08:24.060,"Now I know that sounds crazy, but come with me for a minute."
00:08:33.280,00:08:34.860,"This is you."
00:08:34.860,00:08:41.660,"in standard Newtonian physics we draw your weight force, the force of gravity pushing you down"
00:08:41.660,00:08:45.040,"and the normal force from the floor pushing you up."
00:08:45.040,00:08:50.960,"We say these forces are equal and opposite, so there's no net force on you, so you are not accelerating."
00:08:50.960,00:08:55.540,"But in general relativity, gravity is not a force."
00:08:55.540,00:08:57.560,"You have no weight."
00:08:57.560,00:09:01.280,"So the only force on you are these normal forces pushing you up."
00:09:01.720,00:09:04.000,"So you are accelerating upwards."
00:09:04.000,00:09:06.200,"But I'm not moving up!"
00:09:06.200,00:09:07.400,"Relative to what?"
00:09:07.760,00:09:11.620,"I mean, relative to the flip chart and the floor and basically everything in this room."
00:09:11.620,00:09:16.160,"But all of those things are in your frame of reference, which you know is not inertial."
00:09:16.720,00:09:20.480,"Relative to everything in my rocket ship, I'm not accelerating."
00:09:22.680,00:09:28.780,"What you need if you really want to measure your acceleration is someone in an inertial frame of reference,"
00:09:28.780,00:09:30.540,"like the guy who fell off the roof"
00:09:31.320,00:09:36.100,"And he would see you accelerating up at 9.8 meters per second squared."
00:09:37.800,00:09:45.260,"I think what this shows is that what an acceleration really is is it's a deviation from a geodesic"
00:09:46.080,00:09:52.460,"You can't follow a straight line path through space time because the floor prevents you from doing that:"
00:09:52.460,00:09:55.980,"it applies a force upwards on you, so you're accelerating up."
00:09:56.560,00:10:00.740,"But if I'm accelerating up and so is everyone else around the world"
00:10:00.740,00:10:03.120,"and presumably the whole surface of the Earth,"
00:10:03.120,00:10:05.360,"Then, shouldn't the earth be expanding?"
00:10:06.140,00:10:12.900,"No. It is possible for you to be accelerating, even though your spatial coordinates are not changing."
00:10:13.260,00:10:16.240,"I will show you one equation from general relativity"
00:10:17.340,00:10:22.040,"This says that the second derivative of your position with respect to time"
00:10:22.040,00:10:26.320,"is equal to your acceleration, that's just f on m,"
00:10:26.320,00:10:30.680,"And if you were in flat spacetime, well, this is exactly what you're saying"
00:10:30.680,00:10:33.380,"if you're accelerating your spatial coordinates have to change."
00:10:33.840,00:10:40.380,"But you're not in flat space time, and this term is related to the curvature of spacetime"
00:10:40.380,00:10:43.660," and this is your velocity through time squared."
00:10:44.320,00:10:50.400,"You don't have to worry about the details here, the point is your position can be not changing."
00:10:50.400,00:10:57.460,"This can be zero, which means your acceleration must be exactly equal to"
00:10:57.460,00:11:02.300,"this curvature term times are velocity through time squared."
00:11:02.300,00:11:08.120,"So in curved spacetime, you need to accelerate just to stand still."
00:11:10.340,00:11:13.900,"A lot of this may seem more complicated than Newtonian physics,"
00:11:13.900,00:11:19.000,"but one classical mystery looks a whole lot simpler in general relativity,"
00:11:19.000,00:11:22.420,"which is why all objects fall at the same rate."
00:11:25.100,00:11:27.680,"Now I have made a number of videos on this topic"
00:11:27.680,00:11:31.120,"and I would always give the standard Newtonian explanation:"
00:11:31.120,00:11:35.440,"the only force on a free falling body is its weight g m m on r squared,"
00:11:35.440,00:11:38.000,"which equals its mass times acceleration."
00:11:38.000,00:11:41.380,"You can cancel the objects mass on both sides of the equation."
00:11:41.380,00:11:44.800,"Hence, all objects will have this same acceleration."
00:11:45.600,00:11:49.820,"The mystery is why we could cancel these two m's,"
00:11:49.820,00:11:56.540,"the one on the left was gravitational mass, the property of an object that creates and experiences a gravitational field."
00:11:56.540,00:12:02.060,"While the m on the right is inertial mass, a measure of resistance to acceleration."
00:12:02.620,00:12:08.480,"Why should these two conceptually different properties be numerically identical?"
00:12:09.440,00:12:13.260,"Scientists have spent a lot of time and effort experimentally testing"
00:12:13.260,00:12:19.420,"down to around one part in 10 trillion that these two types of mass really are the same."
00:12:20.220,00:12:23.820,"But in general relativity, there is no mystery."
00:12:23.820,00:12:28.220,"All objects appear to fall the same way because they're not accelerating."
00:12:28.220,00:12:33.440,"They're just following straight line pass through spacetime until they encounter something that stops them."
00:12:33.440,00:12:37.740,"Like the objects in the rocket ship, they appear to accelerate at the same rate"
00:12:37.740,00:12:39.980,"because they're not really accelerating."
00:12:39.980,00:12:42.520,"It's the floor accelerating into them."
00:12:44.280,00:12:46.580,"Now, a lot of us might seem pretty far fetched "
00:12:46.580,00:12:49.980,"as it did back in 1915 when Einstein proposed it"
00:12:49.980,00:12:55.280,"So he very cleverly came up with a measurable prediction that scientists could make to test his theory."
00:12:55.920,00:13:00.140,"Imagine that this rocket ship is coasting through deep space"
00:13:00.140,00:13:05.460,"If you shine a light beam across the rocket ship, well it'll do exactly what you expect:"
00:13:05.460,00:13:12.020,"light travels in a straight line and hits a point on the opposite wall at exactly the same height as the source."
00:13:12.020,00:13:15.160,"But now what if this rocket is accelerating?"
00:13:15.160,00:13:21.100,"Well, to an external observer, they're still going to see the same thing: light traveling in a straight line,"
00:13:21.100,00:13:28.660,"but inside the rocket, during the time it takes the light to travel across the cabin, The rocket will have sped up."
00:13:28.660,00:13:33.440,"So by the time it hits the other wall, it'll hit a little lower than before."
00:13:34.240,00:13:38.980,"So in an accelerating frame of reference light deflects down"
00:13:40.740,00:13:43.680,"Here I'm dramatically exaggerating the effect,"
00:13:43.680,00:13:48.320,"even if I were accelerating up at 10 G's, which would probably kill me,"
00:13:48.320,00:13:51.780,"the deflection would be on the order of the width of a proton."
00:13:52.500,00:13:58.300,"Still, it shows that an accelerating frame of reference will bend light."
00:13:58.300,00:14:04.040,"So Einstein reasoned light must also bend when it passes a large mass"
00:14:04.040,00:14:06.860,"But where do you find a mass large enough?"
00:14:06.860,00:14:12.100,"Well, the only obvious huge mass near the Earth is the sun."
00:14:12.100,00:14:19.340,"So the ideal experiment would be to look at light passing just next to the sun and see if it is deflected."
00:14:19.340,00:14:22.220,"Say light from distant stars."
00:14:22.220,00:14:27.060,"The problem was, of course, the sun is just so bright, you can't see stars right next to it."
00:14:27.060,00:14:33.020,"Unless there is a total solar eclipse, which is exactly what happened in 1919"
00:14:33.020,00:14:40.220,"So Arthur Eddington set out to take pictures of the stars right next to the sun during totality."
00:14:40.940,00:14:43.480,"And what he found by analyzing those pictures,"
00:14:43.480,00:14:51.580,"was that their positions appeared deflected by the precise amount predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity"
00:14:51.580,00:14:56.700,"The result was twice the deflection some had calculated using a strictly Newtonian model"
00:14:56.700,00:15:02.120,"And general relativity has passed virtually every test put to it over the past hundred years or so,"
00:15:02.120,00:15:04.960,"but there are still more things to try"
00:15:09.520,00:15:17.340,"A well known and empirically validated finding is that accelerating charges radiates electromagnetic radiation."
00:15:17.340,00:15:20.540,"So one conceptually simple experimental test"
00:15:20.540,00:15:27.040,"would be to compare the behavior of a stationary charge and a gravitational field to a free falling one"
00:15:27.040,00:15:30.500,"If a more Newtonian picture of gravity is correct,"
00:15:30.500,00:15:34.660,"well then the stationary charge should not radiate electromagnetic radiation,"
00:15:34.660,00:15:39.080,"but a free falling one is accelerating and therefore it should radiate."
00:15:39.080,00:15:44.800,"In contrast, general relativity sees the free-falling charge as non accelerating."
00:15:44.800,00:15:48.080,"It's just going on a straight line path through curve space time,"
00:15:48.080,00:15:54.640,"whereas the stationary charge is accelerating and therefore it should give off electromagnetic radiation."
00:15:55.320,00:16:00.540,"Now, thus far logistical challenges have prevented anyone from actually carrying out this experiment,"
00:16:00.540,00:16:07.820,"but what you believe will happen reveals what you truly think about the nature of gravity."
00:16:07.820,00:16:13.720,"Do you think that a freely falling charge will radiate electromagnetic radiation or not?"
00:16:14.400,00:16:16.520,"Is gravity an illusion?"
00:16:19.920,00:16:21.960,"This episode was sponsored by Caseta"
00:16:21.960,00:16:26.500,"and so I used the sponsorship money to have a rocket ship built"
00:16:30.340,00:16:33.760,"Caseta by Lutron makes these smart light switches in the rocket ship."
00:16:33.760,00:16:36.960,"They also make remotes, motion sensors, smart plugs,"
00:16:36.960,00:16:41.520,"basically every smart switch you could use for turning things in your home on and off"
00:16:41.880,00:16:45.140,"But installing a smart switch isn't rocket science."
00:16:45.140,00:16:48.840,"You just turn off the power to the switch, detach the existing wires,"
00:16:48.840,00:16:51.460,"and reconnect them to the Caseta smart switch."
00:16:51.460,00:16:57.980,"What's great about smart switches, as opposed to smart bulbs, is one switch often controls multiple bulbs."
00:16:57.980,00:17:00.880,"So you can save money by replacing only the switch."
00:17:00.880,00:17:06.540,"And they connect to most smart devices like Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple home kit."
00:17:06.540,00:17:09.520,"And you can control them via an app on your phone."
00:17:09.520,00:17:15.600,"So if you forget to turn off the lights and the rocket, no need to go back, just turn them off in the app."
00:17:15.600,00:17:20.280,"You can also use the app to set up schedules, turning the lights on when it goes dark."
00:17:20.280,00:17:25.200,"This gives you peace of mind knowing your family will always come home to a well lit house."
00:17:25.200,00:17:29.140,"Now we may not have personal rockets yet, but we have smart switches"
00:17:29.140,00:17:33.380,"and the smart choice for these devices is Caseta by Lutron."
