00:00:00.000,00:00:01.470,"This is 10 micrograms."
00:00:01.470,00:00:03.240,"You think that I might be able to see?"
00:00:03.240,00:00:05.190,"I think you might be able to."
00:00:05.190,00:00:06.023,"Oh boy."
00:00:06.023,00:00:07.080,"It's an arrow right there."
00:00:07.080,00:00:07.913,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:00:07.913,00:00:09.450,"This flashlight will help."
00:00:09.450,00:00:12.480,"I feel like I need to get video of this."
00:00:12.480,00:00:14.146,"[Dr. Shaw] I don't know how."
00:00:14.146,00:00:15.812,"(Dr. Shaw laughing) It kinda looks like a hair,"
00:00:15.812,00:00:16.645,"like a tiny,- Yeah."
00:00:16.645,00:00:19.500,"like a smaller than an eyelash."
00:00:19.500,00:00:22.710,"If you wanna measure a force like the weight of an object,"
00:00:22.710,00:00:24.180,"the way it has always been done"
00:00:24.180,00:00:27.540,"has been to balance it with some known standards."
00:00:27.540,00:00:30.960,"And the most precise standard weight people ever created"
00:00:30.960,00:00:33.930,"was the kilogram, a platinum-iridium cylinder"
00:00:33.930,00:00:36.862,"stored in a vault on the outskirts of Paris."
00:00:36.862,00:00:38.160,"(gentle music)"
00:00:38.160,00:00:39.720,"Replicas of this kilogram were sent"
00:00:39.720,00:00:41.250,"to countries around the world"
00:00:41.250,00:00:43.380,"to use as their mass standards."
00:00:43.380,00:00:47.190,"Here is K20, the United States Mass Standard."
00:00:47.190,00:00:49.620,"And yes, the US is secretly metric."
00:00:49.620,00:00:53.610,"They just apply a conversion factor to get to ""freedom units""."
00:00:53.610,00:00:55.740,"It's just a little translation that we do here,"
00:00:55.740,00:00:58.530,"but our country is actually on the metric system."
00:00:58.530,00:01:00.450,"Doesn't that seem crazy?"
00:01:00.450,00:01:01.773,"Yes, it's stupid."
00:01:02.640,00:01:05.400,"The uncertainty in the mass of a standard kilogram"
00:01:05.400,00:01:08.160,"is on the order of tens of micrograms."
00:01:08.160,00:01:10.350,"So that's tens of parts per billion"
00:01:10.350,00:01:15.350,"or about 0.000001%."
00:01:15.690,00:01:17.370,"It's pretty good."
00:01:17.370,00:01:19.320,"But there's a problem if you want to weigh"
00:01:19.320,00:01:21.450,"something lighter than a kilogram,"
00:01:21.450,00:01:23.730,"the uncertainty increases."
00:01:23.730,00:01:27.210,"This little object here is a 50 gram test weight."
00:01:27.210,00:01:28.650,"So it's a reference mass."
00:01:28.650,00:01:30.090,"Can I pick it up?"
00:01:30.090,00:01:31.050,"Maybe with tweezers?"
00:01:31.050,00:01:32.160,"Yeah, if you don't mind?"
00:01:32.160,00:01:32.993,"Sure."
00:01:32.993,00:01:35.250,"[Dr. Shaw] We try to keep the fingerprints off."
00:01:35.250,00:01:37.253,"so it's got a little bit of heft. You can feel that."
00:01:37.253,00:01:39.180,"A little, yeah."
00:01:39.180,00:01:40.770,"What about this one, what's this?"
00:01:40.770,00:01:42.520,"[Dr. Shaw] This is 10 grams here."
00:01:44.190,00:01:45.270,"Yeah, that's pretty light."
00:01:45.270,00:01:46.440,"That's pretty light."
00:01:46.440,00:01:48.783,"And paperclip here is about one gram."
00:01:49.650,00:01:52.470,"And so, how you might use one of these test masses."
00:01:52.470,00:01:55.770,"So, if you're working in a laboratory or something like that"
00:01:55.770,00:01:58.050,"you could take one of these little weights"
00:01:58.050,00:02:00.690,"and put it on here and you could look at the scale and say,"
00:02:00.690,00:02:04.320,"oh, okay, my scale is reasonably well calibrated here."
00:02:04.320,00:02:07.110,"That last digit might change a little bit."
00:02:07.110,00:02:09.510,"But you could sort of make some statement about"
00:02:09.510,00:02:11.910,"whether or not your scale is accurate."
00:02:11.910,00:02:13.740,"When we're talking about the kilogram,"
00:02:13.740,00:02:16.080,"these are obviously much smaller than a kilogram."
00:02:16.080,00:02:19.740,"How do we think about getting from that large object"
00:02:19.740,00:02:23.460,"down to something that's this size here?"
00:02:23.460,00:02:25.530,"One of the ways to do it is using"
00:02:25.530,00:02:27.000,"conventional mass metrology,"
00:02:27.000,00:02:29.460,"which is that you take the kilogram"
00:02:29.460,00:02:32.310,"and you use a process called subdivision."
00:02:32.310,00:02:35.730,"Where you compare other smaller masses against the kilogram."
00:02:35.730,00:02:39.600,"You take two 500 gram masses"
00:02:39.600,00:02:42.630,"and you make sure that they're equal on your balance."
00:02:42.630,00:02:45.120,"And then you put both of those on your balance"
00:02:45.120,00:02:46.830,"and compare that against a kilogram."
00:02:46.830,00:02:49.290,"Would you go like two 500's"
00:02:49.290,00:02:53.370,"and then two 250's and then two 125's? like you just..."
00:02:53.370,00:02:54.203,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:02:54.203,00:02:56.550,"So you could do like one common arrangement"
00:02:56.550,00:02:57.810,"is something like we have here."
00:02:57.810,00:02:59.730,"This is a 500 milligram mass,"
00:02:59.730,00:03:02.940,"these are two 200 milligram masses,"
00:03:02.940,00:03:05.190,"and that's a 100 milligram mass."
00:03:05.190,00:03:08.685,"So these three sum up to this."
00:03:08.685,00:03:09.518,"Okay."
00:03:09.518,00:03:11.280,"So you can compare those two against each other."
00:03:11.280,00:03:15.120,"The smallest we have here, is down there."
00:03:15.120,00:03:16.860,"That's a milligram."
00:03:16.860,00:03:17.760,"That is a milligram?"
00:03:17.760,00:03:19.680,"[Dr. Shaw] That is a milligram right there."
00:03:19.680,00:03:20.513,"What are they made out of?"
00:03:20.513,00:03:22.650,"Okay, these are made outta stainless steel."
00:03:22.650,00:03:24.180,"And we have to do things like you see"
00:03:24.180,00:03:26.310,"this little lint free brush here."
00:03:26.310,00:03:29.310,"If you have a speck of dust on here or something like that,"
00:03:29.310,00:03:33.324,"it's can be a problem, if it's a big speck of dust."
00:03:33.324,00:03:35.940,"So every time we do weighings with these,"
00:03:35.940,00:03:38.580,"we'll take a lint free cloth and a brush"
00:03:38.580,00:03:40.470,"and clean them off a little bit."
00:03:40.470,00:03:42.240,"Why are they this sort of"
00:03:42.240,00:03:44.790,"curious wire kind of shape?"
00:03:44.790,00:03:45.623,"The shapes?"
00:03:45.623,00:03:46.456,"Yeah."
00:03:46.456,00:03:48.870,"It helps you remember which one is which."
00:03:48.870,00:03:53.730,"The five-sided one is 500 milligrams."
00:03:53.730,00:03:54.930,"One of the interesting things"
00:03:54.930,00:03:57.480,"from my perspective about this is that"
00:03:57.480,00:04:00.510,"you can really subdivide over a large range"
00:04:00.510,00:04:02.520,"of these masses from a kilogram."
00:04:02.520,00:04:05.580,"this is one millionth of a kilogram is a milligram."
00:04:05.580,00:04:09.733,"So you can subdivide the kilogram by a million times."
00:04:09.733,00:04:11.700,"But you sort of pay a price for that,"
00:04:11.700,00:04:14.220,"because each time you do this subdivision,"
00:04:14.220,00:04:17.280,"the uncertainty increases a little bit, right?"
00:04:17.280,00:04:19.830,"So what is the uncertainty in say the milligram there?"
00:04:19.830,00:04:21.900,"If you do it with a subdivision,"
00:04:21.900,00:04:26.900,"it will be maybe a part in 10 to the four,"
00:04:26.910,00:04:28.470,"one part in 10 to the four."
00:04:28.470,00:04:32.400,"So like 0.01 percent-ish range."
00:04:32.400,00:04:34.680,"But there is a way to do better,"
00:04:34.680,00:04:36.120,"and that's thanks to the fact the"
00:04:36.120,00:04:37.800,"kilogram is no longer defined"
00:04:37.800,00:04:40.770,"by the platinum-iridium cylinder in Paris."
00:04:40.770,00:04:42.510,"Over the course of a century or so,"
00:04:42.510,00:04:45.060,"the replica kilograms were brought back to Paris"
00:04:45.060,00:04:47.820,"a few times to be weighed with each other."
00:04:47.820,00:04:50.400,"And from those measurements it became clear"
00:04:50.400,00:04:55.350,"that their weights were diverging by up to 75 micrograms."
00:04:55.350,00:04:57.960,"No one could say if the replicas were getting heavier"
00:04:57.960,00:05:00.390,"or if the original was getting lighter."
00:05:00.390,00:05:02.970,"But it was unacceptable to have mass standards"
00:05:02.970,00:05:04.830,"with changing masses."
00:05:04.830,00:05:07.080,"So the solution was to eliminate"
00:05:07.080,00:05:09.540,"the kilogram's dependence on a physical object"
00:05:09.540,00:05:13.020,"and instead define it based on a constant of nature,"
00:05:13.020,00:05:14.550,"Planck's constant."
00:05:14.550,00:05:16.260,"So how does that work?"
00:05:16.260,00:05:18.030,"Well, Planck's constant is best known"
00:05:18.030,00:05:20.160,"for relating the frequency of a photon"
00:05:20.160,00:05:23.520,"to its energy by E=hf."
00:05:23.520,00:05:27.870,"But energy and mass are related through E=mc2."
00:05:27.870,00:05:31.950,"So you can see how mass is related to Planck's constant."
00:05:31.950,00:05:35.070,"In 2019, scientists officially set the value"
00:05:35.070,00:05:39.000,"of Planck's constant to be this number in Joule-seconds"
00:05:39.000,00:05:42.060,"which, along with the definition of the meter and the second,"
00:05:42.060,00:05:45.420,"now defines what a kilogram is."
00:05:45.420,00:05:47.280,"The real advantage of this definition"
00:05:47.280,00:05:50.013,"is how it can be applied in fancy scales."
00:05:51.510,00:05:53.130,"This is a Kibble balance."
00:05:53.130,00:05:55.110,"It can balance the weight of an object"
00:05:55.110,00:05:57.210,"with an electromagnetic force."
00:05:57.210,00:06:00.240,"What's great about that is that the electrical quantities"
00:06:00.240,00:06:04.350,"used in this balance can be read out very accurately,"
00:06:04.350,00:06:07.290,"and in units of Planck's constant."
00:06:07.290,00:06:09.630,"So you get direct traceability"
00:06:09.630,00:06:12.303,"by weighing something in this balance."
00:06:13.230,00:06:16.920,"This is kind of the smaller cousin of the Kibble balance."
00:06:16.920,00:06:21.270,"It's called the electrostatic force balance or the EFB."
00:06:21.270,00:06:23.820,"And this is a balance that was designed,"
00:06:23.820,00:06:28.590,"specifically to measure mass sort of in the milligram range."
00:06:28.590,00:06:31.950,"The Kibble balance uses an electromagnet, I use a capacitor,"
00:06:31.950,00:06:35.130,"which is basically two metal electrodes"
00:06:35.130,00:06:36.960,"that you apply a potential to."
00:06:36.960,00:06:40.050,"And when you apply a potential, there's an attractive force"
00:06:40.050,00:06:41.820,"between those two electrodes."
00:06:41.820,00:06:45.390,"I apply an electrostatic force by applying a voltage here"
00:06:45.390,00:06:49.200,"at this you can see the cylinder here."
00:06:49.200,00:06:51.390,"There's this cylinder and there's inside of this"
00:06:51.390,00:06:53.730,"there's another cylinder, and they're close together."
00:06:53.730,00:06:56.160,"So you have this concentric cylinder like this."
00:06:56.160,00:06:57.300,"And when you apply a voltage,"
00:06:57.300,00:07:01.260,"it pulls that moving cylinder down in there."
00:07:01.260,00:07:05.340,"And by measuring the properties of the capacitor"
00:07:05.340,00:07:07.380,"and measuring the voltage that we apply,"
00:07:07.380,00:07:10.710,"we can know exactly how much force we get here."
00:07:10.710,00:07:13.290,"And then up here, we drop our mass on."
00:07:13.290,00:07:16.500,"So we compare our gravitational force from the mass"
00:07:16.500,00:07:19.620,"to the electrostatic force from our capacitor."
00:07:19.620,00:07:21.450,"To get the best accuracy,"
00:07:21.450,00:07:24.330,"this lab is located deep underground"
00:07:24.330,00:07:25.740,"and they keep the air temperature"
00:07:25.740,00:07:28.530,"a constant 20 degrees Celsius to avoid"
00:07:28.530,00:07:32.670,"any thermal expansion or contraction of the devices."
00:07:32.670,00:07:35.850,"And all measurements in this balance are made in a vacuum."
00:07:35.850,00:07:38.550,"So there are no air currents and no buoyant force"
00:07:38.550,00:07:40.590,"on the object from the atmosphere."
00:07:40.590,00:07:42.930,"They've even carefully measured the acceleration"
00:07:42.930,00:07:44.820,"due to gravity in the lab."
00:07:44.820,00:07:47.250,"Here it is, it's under the chair."
00:07:47.250,00:07:48.660,"Right there, that triangle,"
00:07:48.660,00:07:52.770,"that is where the USGS measured absolute gravity"
00:07:52.770,00:07:57.540,"with an absolute perimeter 9.801-ish meters per second."
00:07:57.540,00:08:00.630,"Does this lab measure small forces"
00:08:00.630,00:08:02.700,"the most accurately in the world?"
00:08:02.700,00:08:07.170,"At the milligram level, so 10 micro newtons-ish of force."
00:08:07.170,00:08:10.800,"Yes, this measures force the most accurately in the world."
00:08:10.800,00:08:12.660,"I'm confident in saying that,"
00:08:12.660,00:08:15.780,"but of course, you can go lower than that."
00:08:15.780,00:08:19.530,"This is the smallest weight and you can't see it here."
00:08:19.530,00:08:20.910,"This is 10 micrograms."
00:08:20.910,00:08:23.940,"So when you think about the uncertainty in a kilogram,"
00:08:23.940,00:08:26.220,"when you take Planck's constant at a Kibble balance"
00:08:26.220,00:08:28.380,"and you realize the kilogram,"
00:08:28.380,00:08:31.470,"you're at that level of about 10 micrograms."
00:08:31.470,00:08:34.587,"And that is what 10 micrograms, I mean you can't,"
00:08:34.587,00:08:37.800,"I had to put the little arrow here so you can."
00:08:37.800,00:08:39.300,"If you were here in the laboratory"
00:08:39.300,00:08:41.550,"you could look and peer down there maybe."
00:08:41.550,00:08:44.730,"I feel like I need to to get video of this"
00:08:44.730,00:08:46.773,"so people can see what 10 micrograms."
00:08:47.775,00:08:49.563,"[Dr. Shaw] I don't know how."
00:08:50.490,00:08:52.440,"It kinda looks like a hair, like a tiny,"
00:08:52.440,00:08:54.900,"like a smaller than an eyelash, right?"
00:08:54.900,00:08:55.733,"[Dr. Shaw] It is really much,"
00:08:55.733,00:08:56.790,"yeah, that's about the... Much thinner."
00:08:56.790,00:08:58.260,"[Dr. Shaw] Yeah, that's about the scale"
00:08:58.260,00:08:59.550,"you're looking at there, yeah."
00:08:59.550,00:09:02.520,"I'm almost certain I can capture this on video."
00:09:02.520,00:09:04.600,"We brought a special lens with us."
00:09:04.600,00:09:05.433,"Ooh yes."
00:09:05.433,00:09:06.266,"We brought a special,"
00:09:06.266,00:09:07.099,"Special lens."
00:09:07.099,00:09:08.070,"2024 mill macro,"
00:09:08.070,00:09:10.470,"'cause I was like, we're gonna need it for this."
00:09:11.610,00:09:12.873,"Try to find this thing."
00:09:15.630,00:09:17.100,"Oh, I can see it."
00:09:17.100,00:09:19.223,"Oh yes. Do you see it there?"
00:09:19.223,00:09:20.973,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you got it."
00:09:22.380,00:09:23.490,"You made this?"
00:09:23.490,00:09:25.710,"Yes, with great trouble"
00:09:25.710,00:09:27.840,"and then calibrated it on a balance."
00:09:27.840,00:09:30.663,"It was, man, I'll tell you, it was not easy."
00:09:31.530,00:09:32.910,"When you have that thing,"
00:09:32.910,00:09:35.130,"you can imagine what it's like trying to work"
00:09:35.130,00:09:36.780,"with something like this, right?"
00:09:36.780,00:09:39.630,"And this is about as small as you can reasonably"
00:09:39.630,00:09:42.183,"expect to make something as a test weight."
00:09:43.170,00:09:45.390,"And if you wanna measure a force smaller than that,"
00:09:45.390,00:09:47.820,"so I have these little tiny chips here."
00:09:47.820,00:09:51.540,"These are atomic force microscope cantilevers."
00:09:51.540,00:09:54.291,"There're little tiny force sensors on the end of these."
00:09:54.291,00:09:57.300,"There're little tiny cantilever beams with a sharp tip."
00:09:57.300,00:10:01.050,"And you can use that sharp tip to press against things"
00:10:01.050,00:10:04.740,"and apply nanonewton to piconewton forces."
00:10:04.740,00:10:06.570,"But I mean the tip is so small"
00:10:06.570,00:10:08.730,"it's very, very difficult to see."
00:10:08.730,00:10:10.500,"It really requires a microscope."
00:10:10.500,00:10:12.360,"Is it like there's a little diving board on there?"
00:10:12.360,00:10:13.200,"Yeah, exactly."
00:10:13.200,00:10:14.850,"There's a little diving board, that's right."
00:10:14.850,00:10:16.380,"It looks like a little diving board."
00:10:16.380,00:10:17.640,"It's like a spring, right?"
00:10:17.640,00:10:18.600,"And if you push on it,"
00:10:18.600,00:10:20.670,"the more it bends the larger the force."
00:10:20.670,00:10:23.691,"What is the smallest force that you want to measure?"
00:10:23.691,00:10:24.524,"Do you have a..."
00:10:24.524,00:10:27.030,"Yeah, I can show you, I can show you."
00:10:27.030,00:10:30.870,"This is one of the sensors we used to do the smallest forces"
00:10:30.870,00:10:33.180,"that I can confidently say we've measured"
00:10:33.180,00:10:34.890,"that are traceable in some way"
00:10:34.890,00:10:37.503,"to the International System of units."
00:10:38.400,00:10:41.280,"And that is a femtonewtons of force"
00:10:41.280,00:10:43.380,"at about a piconewton would be"
00:10:43.380,00:10:46.050,"like if you're stretching out a DNA molecule."
00:10:46.050,00:10:48.300,"So, if you take it a DNA molecule"
00:10:48.300,00:10:50.610,"and stretch it out end to end, that's a piconewton."
00:10:50.610,00:10:53.490,"So back to a factor of a thousand less than that"
00:10:53.490,00:10:54.450,"was what we were measuring."
00:10:54.450,00:10:57.000,"So, this is an example of one of the sensors"
00:10:57.000,00:10:59.880,"we use to get to the sort of femtonewton level."
00:10:59.880,00:11:02.400,"This is a fused silica parallelogram flexor."
00:11:02.400,00:11:03.450,"You can't see it really well."
00:11:03.450,00:11:06.930,"So let me, I have a big version right here."
00:11:06.930,00:11:09.870,"So what we can do is we can set this vibrating"
00:11:09.870,00:11:13.530,"and it'll vibrate with really pure tone."
00:11:13.530,00:11:16.620,"And we can see very, very small changes in force"
00:11:16.620,00:11:20.760,"based on how far this vibrates up and down."
00:11:20.760,00:11:23.190,"I would have a little laser interferometer,"
00:11:23.190,00:11:25.440,"which measures the motion of this."
00:11:25.440,00:11:27.750,"So we measure the displacement of this end here"
00:11:27.750,00:11:29.250,"and then right next to it we would have"
00:11:29.250,00:11:31.020,"a little tiny optical fiber"
00:11:31.020,00:11:34.680,"that would deliver a known optic laser power to this."
00:11:34.680,00:11:36.900,"So this would be a photon pressure force,"
00:11:36.900,00:11:40.320,"whereby reflecting the light off the surface here"
00:11:40.320,00:11:42.390,"we actually get a very small force."
00:11:42.390,00:11:46.650,"If we vary that force sinusoidally, we vary it in time,"
00:11:46.650,00:11:48.720,"we can get this to move up and down"
00:11:48.720,00:11:50.070,"and we can get it to vibrate."
00:11:50.070,00:11:52.230,"And we can see differences as small"
00:11:52.230,00:11:55.842,"as femtonewtons in our force."
00:11:55.842,00:11:57.720,"So you're saying you could measure the force"
00:11:57.720,00:11:59.820,"from a laser pointer?"
00:11:59.820,00:12:01.680,"Yeah, oh yeah, yeah, definitely."
00:12:01.680,00:12:02.728,"Yeah, we've done that."
00:12:02.728,00:12:03.787,"My pointer was shining on that."
00:12:03.787,00:12:06.690,"That's right, that about approximately"
00:12:06.690,00:12:08.760,"seven piconewtons of force."
00:12:08.760,00:12:11.763,"And once again, that's enough to stretch out a DNA molecule."
00:12:14.010,00:12:14.843,"Can I ask you the big question?"
00:12:14.843,00:12:15.810,"Yeah, yeah."
00:12:15.810,00:12:17.370,"Why does anyone need to measure"
00:12:17.370,00:12:18.203,"forces this small? Yeah,"
00:12:18.203,00:12:19.950,"that's a good question."
00:12:19.950,00:12:22.200,"So a couple of things."
00:12:22.200,00:12:24.570,"there are a couple of different answers to that."
00:12:24.570,00:12:26.880,"One is sort of the industrial relevance."
00:12:26.880,00:12:29.880,"Automotive manufacturers need to measure"
00:12:29.880,00:12:32.670,"the mass of particulates that come off their exhausts,"
00:12:32.670,00:12:34.170,"particularly in diesel systems."
00:12:34.170,00:12:38.430,"Particulate contamination is a really kind of a big deal."
00:12:38.430,00:12:40.170,"So, you need to be able to measure"
00:12:40.170,00:12:43.230,"50 micrograms of these particulates"
00:12:43.230,00:12:45.420,"for those environmental standards to be met."
00:12:45.420,00:12:47.370,"The laser power measurements for people"
00:12:47.370,00:12:49.590,"who are doing industrial processes with lasers,"
00:12:49.590,00:12:51.690,"because you can actually use the measurement"
00:12:51.690,00:12:55.050,"of a small force to calibrate laser power."
00:12:55.050,00:12:58.350,"Pharmaceuticals, you have milligram doses"
00:12:58.350,00:13:00.330,"microgram doses sometimes."
00:13:00.330,00:13:03.090,"The other thing that's important I think"
00:13:03.090,00:13:04.080,"kind of goes to the heart of"
00:13:04.080,00:13:06.900,"why NIST is so cool, in my opinion."
00:13:06.900,00:13:10.080,"Is that it really helps us push the frontiers of science."
00:13:10.080,00:13:12.600,"The new scientific discoveries benefit"
00:13:12.600,00:13:14.460,"from the new measurement capabilities,"
00:13:14.460,00:13:19.460,"which then feed into new precision metrology capabilities."
00:13:19.680,00:13:21.660,"And so, that is really one of the things to me"
00:13:21.660,00:13:23.340,"that makes NIST really special is that"
00:13:23.340,00:13:26.220,"we're very good at sort of creating that environment"
00:13:26.220,00:13:27.980,"where that can happen."
00:13:27.980,00:13:30.897,"(electronic music)"
00:13:34.800,00:13:38.070,"If you, like me, are fascinated by precision measurement"
00:13:38.070,00:13:38.940,"then I bet you would love"
00:13:38.940,00:13:41.160,"the sponsor of this video, Brilliant."
00:13:41.160,00:13:43.380,"Brilliant is a learning tool that helps you master"
00:13:43.380,00:13:45.420,"STEM concepts like foundational math,"
00:13:45.420,00:13:47.700,"computer science, and quantum physics."
00:13:47.700,00:13:49.920,"It's full of interactive hands-on lessons"
00:13:49.920,00:13:51.720,"that build on each other."
00:13:51.720,00:13:53.640,"You don't just get an introduction to a subject,"
00:13:53.640,00:13:56.160,"you actually understand it at a deep level,"
00:13:56.160,00:13:57.780,"and that's because you practice it"
00:13:57.780,00:14:00.510,"and answer questions to test your knowledge."
00:14:00.510,00:14:03.030,"You can try their interactive lessons for free right now"
00:14:03.030,00:14:06.180,"by going to brilliant.org/veritasium"
00:14:06.180,00:14:08.160,"and I would recommend a great place to start"
00:14:08.160,00:14:10.110,"is there course on scientific thinking."
00:14:10.110,00:14:12.210,"There you solve real world puzzles"
00:14:12.210,00:14:15.570,"using scientific principles like gears or balances."
00:14:15.570,00:14:18.390,"And if you wanna dig deeper into forces at the nano scale,"
00:14:18.390,00:14:21.240,"you can learn about how proteins fold and unfold"
00:14:21.240,00:14:24.330,"and connect that to how energy relates to chemical bonds."
00:14:24.330,00:14:26.070,"With questions throughout the lesson,"
00:14:26.070,00:14:28.950,"it's way more engaging than just watching or reading."
00:14:28.950,00:14:30.120,"And if you ever get stuck,"
00:14:30.120,00:14:32.550,"helpful hints are always close at hand."
00:14:32.550,00:14:34.260,"I also love their quantum mechanics course,"
00:14:34.260,00:14:35.850,"because it's totally accessible,"
00:14:35.850,00:14:37.440,"but it doesn't hold back on teaching"
00:14:37.440,00:14:40.710,"quantum state calculations and practical experiments."
00:14:40.710,00:14:42.750,"In fact, you can follow how scientists design"
00:14:42.750,00:14:44.580,"sensitive measurements using light,"
00:14:44.580,00:14:46.170,"just like Dr. Shaw."
00:14:46.170,00:14:49.140,"There's an entire section on designing your own setup"
00:14:49.140,00:14:50.730,"to measure quantum entanglement"
00:14:50.730,00:14:53.550,"using polarizers on an optical table."
00:14:53.550,00:14:54.900,"I love working with Brilliant,"
00:14:54.900,00:14:56.790,"because I think it's the perfect compliment"
