00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Part of this video was sponsored by
LastPass. Stick around to the end for a

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.200
word from our sponsor.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.902
Are negative ions
good for you?

00:00:07.902 --> 00:00:10.138
Normally I'd dismiss such a question out of hand.

00:00:10.138 --> 00:00:12.570
In fact that's
exactly what I did when a friend brought

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.809
it up about a month ago. But he was
insistent he said no this is for real

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.000
there's science behind it.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And so I
looked into it and I found this.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.560
There are literally hundreds of published
peer-reviewed scientific studies on the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.220
biological effects of ions.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.849
It's a body
of research that begins about a century

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.060
ago and continues to the present day.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.220
And
this is just a fraction of it.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.379
Now these studies aren't just about any old ions
they're about atmospheric ions or air

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.300
ions. And although the results are not
uniform, they all begin with the premise

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.260
that positive ions make us feel bad and
negative ions make us feel good.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.040
So in this video I want to get to the bottom
of this.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.960
These are Himalayan salt lamps.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.650
With the heat from the light bulb, it
releases negative ions into the air and of

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.760
course negative ions are what you
breathe in and produce the serotonin in

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.360
the body and in serotonin is like the
primary neurotransmitter in your whole

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.840
body and all living things and that's
what makes you feel good...

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.000
awesome.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.780
Can I jump in here for a second.
When I first heard all this business

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.860
about atmospheric ions, my first thought
was 'why should we expect there to be

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.900
many ions in the atmosphere at all?' I
mean to recap, an ion is just an atom or

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.060
a molecule that has gained or lost an
electron. If it loses an electron it's a

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.590
positive ion. If it gains an electron it
becomes a negative ion. But here's the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.820
thing: unlike charges attract.
So moving about in the atmosphere I'd

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.540
expect the positive and negative ions to
find each other and then BOOM they're

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.580
back to being neutral.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.049
However, as it
turns out there are some processes that

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.300
are constantly generating atmospheric
ions.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.509
For example cosmic rays. These are

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.160
highly energetic particles from across
the universe that slam into our

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.540
atmosphere and transfer their energy to
the air, creating ions in the process.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.430
Cosmic rays are thought to
create around 500 ions per cubic

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.269
centimeter at ground level. In fact
they're the most significant source of

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.000
ions generated over the oceans.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.359
But here
on land there are other sources of

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:32.220
ionization, things like natural
radioactivity.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.540
There are these long-lived

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.670
isotopes of uranium and thorium and
their decay products that can spit out

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.600
highly energetic particles in the form
of alpha, beta and gamma rays.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.200
These ionize the air and they vary widely from
place to place but they can contribute

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.000
hundreds up to many thousands of ions
per cubic centimeter.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.859
If you were to recommend one of these to me that like
has the most negative ions, er, which one

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:02.640
do you think?

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.194
I would just go for which
one's hottest. -yeah?

00:03:04.194 --> 00:03:09.160
Because it's the heat from the lightbulb that creates the heat, which makes the reaction in the salt.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.660
Got it.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.939
Wow! This one's great.
Yeah? This would just be perfect

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.409
And then you have thunderstorms. Each
lightning strike generates copious

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:26.820
amounts of ions.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.640
Perhaps one of the more
surprising sources of negative ions is waterfalls.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.110
As water droplets collide
with each other or with wetted surfaces

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.629
with high velocity, the water molecules
create this electrified spray with

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.333
negative ions that can be transferred to
the air around it.

00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:52.650
Depending on your distance from the waterfall, ion levels
can reach tens of thousands of ions per

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.670
cubic centimeter. And the same effect
occurs with ocean waves crashing on shore.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.340
Hello! 
Hi Derek, how are you?

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.180
Good, Can I give you that? 
Sure.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.180
So what I want to know is how many negative ions are there coming off
that lamp when it's on?

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:24.810
We have a technique involving mass spectrometry
that measures negative ions coming off

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.240
of solids and so we can give it a try.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.820
Are you an ion expert? 
I've been studying

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.660
ions for 55 years. 
Whoa

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.639
And have
written hundreds of papers on all

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.560
aspects of ions.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.520
So this is my salt lamp.
it's meant to give us lots of negative

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.939
ions. Can you tell me whether it's giving
us some negative ions?

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:54.300
We're gonna have a look and the thing we're utilizing here
is that the inlet to this mass

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.780
spectrometer is at atmospheric pressure
and if there's ions there we'll be able

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.090
to detect them. So this is like.. is it is
it kind of like an electronic nose or

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.940
something for ions? sniffs
the ions. - You could think of it as a nose for ions. Yeah, yeah, sniffs the ions. -OK

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.350
The lamp is next to the ion sampling
cone. I mean it's not on yet but we'll see

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.639
if there's any ions coming from it. -No
so this display here this would be this

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:22.139
is our mass to charge axis here so how
how heavy they are in molecular

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.520
weight essentially and if there's ions
being formed we're gonna see some signal

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.720
on this screen. -There'd be like some peaks? Some peaks, yeah

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.010
Now does it need to warm up?

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.860
er -I think that's the idea, yeah.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.610
Now
there are some places that do naturally

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.419
have lower concentrations of ions, namely
the interiors of houses and businesses.

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:49.020
Because these structures provide some
shielding from the cosmic rays and from

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.000
the natural radioactivity. Plus if you
have metal ducting and air

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.349
conditioning, well some of those charged
ions will get stuck in the ducts

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:03.479
so typically levels inside homes and
businesses can be as low as around 100

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:07.000
or 200 ions per cubic centimeter.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.889
Ion
concentrations are also typically lower

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:16.229
in polluted areas, in big cities or
around factories. And that's because the

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.970
ions actually cling to those
pollutants or the aerosols and so they

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.060
don't live as long in the atmosphere.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.530
So
the assertion that we live in

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.276
environments with fewer ions than our
ancestors is true.

00:06:29.276 --> 00:06:34.590
If you're thinking that you feel better
around waterfalls and oceans and after

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.850
thunderstorms than you do in polluted
cities or around big factories, well

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.840
maybe that's the reason why scientists
have been studying the effects of

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.880
negative ions on human health for nearly
a century.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.710
So let's consider the evidence...

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.000
In one study people suffering from
seasonal affective disorder were

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.630
randomly assigned to one of three
treatment groups: bright light therapy

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.600
high concentrations of negative ions or
low concentrations of negative ions.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.050
They found that both bright light therapy and high-density negative ions independently

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.280
produced antidepressant effects, but not
low density negative ions.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:17.310
In another study, participants in a high-density negative
ion environment had significantly faster

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:23.000
reaction times and reported being more
energetic than those in an ambient air control.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.060
Now if all this sounds too
subjective, EEG experiments showed people

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.860
exposed to high-density negative ions
had a slower alpha wave frequency with

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.510
higher amplitude. Participants also
reported increased relaxation, alertness,

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:41.010
and improved working capacity. And
opposite results have been found with

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.970
positive ions. In one study volunteers
were exposed to high concentrations of

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:50.010
positive ions for two hours. Symptoms of
anxiety and excitement significantly

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:55.200
increased. During the time of exposure
serum serotonin levels also increased

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.850
significantly. This has even been taken
into real-world work environments. An

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:03.300
air ionizer was fitted to the
air-conditioning unit in an office

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.890
building and periodically turned on and
off over 12 weeks. When the ionizer was

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:12.480
pumping out negative ions, workers
reported 50% fewer headaches. They also

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.580
reported increased alertness, perceived
atmospheric freshness, and environmental

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:22.560
and personal warmth. It's feeling it's
feeling pretty hot it's been on for an

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:28.830
hour? yeah. So the question is can a salt
lamp generate negative ions? let's check

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.140
for negative ions?
-let's look again

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.600
Doesn't look like it.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:41.520
But, I mean there's not even like a
background.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.280
No, there's not... it's just like

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.100
it's not even sitting there.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.930
So your conclusion after testing this device is

00:08:54.930 --> 00:09:00.200
that it's producing no negative ions.
-We're certainly not able to detect any negative ions.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.080
The idea for how these
salt lamps are meant to create negative

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.760
ions is that water molecules are meant
to land on the surface and liberate

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.100
chloride ions from the lattice.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.220
But ask any chemist worth their salt and they'll

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.660
tell you the energy required to do this
is way too high so it just doesn't

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.340
happen.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:24.180
What I find ironic is that there
are crystals which when heated will

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.750
produce ions.
It's just that salt doesn't have the

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.700
right crystal structure to make this
work. The gemstone tourmaline does.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.140
Those samples are worth many thousands of
dollars.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:41.580
Tourmaline has a structure such that if you heat it and cause it to expand, it will actually

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:46.290
develop an electric charge on the faces
of the of the crystal you have

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:50.910
discharges between those faces, breakdown in air and forming ions and that

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:55.650
charge then can get transferred to any
organic molecule that's present in the air.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:59.910
A five degree change was enough to generate ions. 
-I just find this

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:06.060
extraordinary that there is a crystal,
there is a material that you could heat

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:10.230
up and create negative ions. So the
reason people wouldn't have tourmaline

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:16.311
lamps is because tourmaline is just
really expensive?

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.720
okay so we didn't get

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.490
any ions off of the salt lamp but I
brought something along that I think

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:29.850
might give us some ions. This is an ionic
air purifier. When this product was first

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:35.130
launched it sold a two million units. It
works by using high voltage to ionize

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.610
the air and accelerate those ions to
produce the light breeze you can feel

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:42.390
without any moving parts.
-Okay I feel a breeze coming out of it

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:46.860
and that should be going into the nozzle?
we've got it pointed right at our ion

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.260
Inlet so that's good.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.760
We seem to be
seeing some ions at the moment and we

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.233
have the ionic breeze right up next to
the source so.

00:10:54.233 --> 00:10:55.740
These are negative ions

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.880
these are negative ions.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.200
So if you want
negative ions what you need in your

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.900
house is not a salt lamp, it's an ionic
air purifier.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.290
Before you rush out to buy

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:11.760
one I should warn you that generating
these ions produces an unfortunate

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.720
by-product:

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:18.300
ozone. So right now we're
measuring about 17 parts per billion

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:22.800
actually of ozone. So let's put this
up to the front and see whether or not

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.940
we see an increase in the amount of
ozone.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.890
It's up over 80. So now I think

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:36.140
we're actually at the level of a smog
alert.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.030
So you're saying that this device

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:45.460
is creating air that would be considered
smog in a city?

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:49.680
I believe so yeah.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.980
That is kind of ridiculous for something that's
meant to purify the air. Can you smell

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:57.100
the ozone? -yeah -whoa

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:02.010
Does it trouble you?
Oh, it doesn't bother me. I know it and I

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:05.385
want to either leave the lab or turn it
off.

00:12:05.385 --> 00:12:07.860
What am i smelling for here?

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.890
should... -oh yeah
the sweet smell  -oh yeah -that smell a

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:13.380
little sweet? 
yeah? 
yeah -I uh...

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.050
A lot of people like
that smell but if you smell that it's

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:20.070
not good. so perhaps we should shut this
off before we asphyxiate ourselves.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:26.370
So, generating clean negative
ions is challenging but is it even worth

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:31.560
the effort? the research is inconsistent.
No significant difference. Evidence for

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.530
beneficial effects of negative ions on
mood and performance could not be

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.530
demonstrated. Of the studies that report
significant results,

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:42.480
many have methodological problems in
some participants weren't blinded to the

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.470
treatment they were receiving. When they
were blinded they may still have known

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:51.690
when negative ions were present by the
faint smell of ozone. Most of the studies

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:56.160
have very small sample sizes. Plus they
surveyed participants on a number

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.699
of measures increasing the likelihood
that at least one would show a

00:12:59.699 --> 00:13:04.379
significant difference, just due to
random chance. Ion levels were typically

00:13:04.379 --> 00:13:08.190
measured at the source and the distance
to subjects was not tightly controlled

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:12.300
nor were the other components of the air
so there's no guarantee that

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:16.120
participants were even receiving the
expected levels of ions.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:22.680
A meta-analysis from 2013 reviewing all the prior human ion studies concluded there was quote "no

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:27.899
consistent influence of positive or
negative air ionization on anxiety mood

00:13:27.899 --> 00:13:32.910
relaxation sleep and personal comfort
measures" the only link they found was

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:37.350
between negative air ionization and
lower depression scores, though the authors

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:41.790
caution future research is needed to
evaluate the biological plausibility of

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:42.980
this association.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:47.040
Because fundamentally
the idea that ions have any biological

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.100
effect is implausible.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.490
Consider that in a
cubic centimeter of air there are 10 to

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:58.259
the 19 air molecules. So even with tens
of thousands of ions the amount is

00:13:58.259 --> 00:14:02.610
insignificant, not even one part per
billion we're talking parts per million

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:06.689
billion. And there's no reason to suspect
the extra electrons would do anything

00:14:06.689 --> 00:14:11.279
anyway. I mean in your daily life
you are constantly building up charge on

00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:13.800
your skin and discharging it through
little zaps

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.579
say when you touch a doorknob. What would a few more stray electrons

00:14:17.579 --> 00:14:20.880
extracellular do? - yeah

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.649
Uh, probably not much.
So if ions do anything it would likely

00:14:25.649 --> 00:14:29.969
be indirectly say by removing pollutants
and odors from the air.

00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:34.410
The ions would cling to the chemicals and then they
would say get attracted to surfaces

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:37.960
surfaces and stick to the surface the
chemicals stay on the surface.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:44.370
So I think ultimately if you are looking for a way
to improve your mental and physical

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:51.209
health that is backed by strong
scientific evidence, then you should take

00:14:51.209 --> 00:14:56.160
a walk outside. I mean you can walk near
a waterfall or near the ocean if you

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:03.440
like but the thing that is proven to
boost your mood is the exercise.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:09.000
And as an added bonus you're guaranteed
to get some fresh air.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:24.400
Hey this episode was sponsored by
LastPass. You know I remember the very

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:29.320
first password I ever created. It was a
pin for an ATM card and I was told I

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:34.090
could select four numbers or spell out a
word using the letters underneath. So I

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:42.610
picked W O R D word easy to remember
sure secure not so much and today many

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:46.150
of us still do this pick passwords that
are easy to remember rather than ones

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:50.560
that are secure so you need a password
manager. With LastPass

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.730
you get unlimited password storage,
password breach alerts and free

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:58.540
cross-device sync. One thing I
particularly like is if other people

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:02.280
ever need access to your accounts you
can safely and easily share passwords

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:07.240
LastPass auto fills your credentials on
mobile sites and apps for iOS and

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:12.100

LastPass will fill in your username and

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.760
password so you'll never get locked out
again. With LastPass

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:20.080
you don't have to write, remember or
reset passwords. LastPass keeps track of

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.100
your passwords easily so you don't have
to. Put your passwords on autopilot with
