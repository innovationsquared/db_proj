00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.060
Can you spot the problem with this image?

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.860
This is the baby photo of our universe.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.059
It shows the whole universe as it was when
it was just 380,000 years old.

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.840
Ok, so that doesn’t sound very young for
a baby photo, but if you consider the universe

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.550
today to be an 80 year old person, than that
image is the equivalent of a baby pic taken

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.169
at 19 hours after birth.

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.140
So it truly is a baby photo.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.230
But why can’t we get a photo from an earlier
time than that?

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.640
Well, the problem is the universe before 380,000
thousand years after the big bang was so hot

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.100
that all the matter in it, all these protons
and electrons was in a state of plasma.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.050
They were all flying all over the place and
any light passing through there would get

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.430
scattered or absorbed.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.239
So the whole universe was opaque.

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.710
The light couldn’t travel anywhere, until
380,000 years when the universe had expanded

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.440
and cooled enough for the protons and the
electrons to get together and form hydrogen

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.699
atoms, right, this clear gas.

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.770
So finally after bouncing around for 380,000
years like pinballs, these photons could finally

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.470
travel out through space.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.070
And there they would go, on these photons
would go for 13.8 billion years.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.580
The whole lifetime of our universe these photons
were just traveling through space, not hitting

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.220
anything until they reached our detector.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.190
And that is how we formed this baby image
of our whole universe.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.860
Now, of course, over that time our universe
expanded a lot.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.270
So those photons which started out as ultraviolet
light or visible radiation, blue light, ended

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.260
up as microwaves by the time it got to us.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.850
They expanded along with the universe.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.650
And that is why we can’t see the earliest
light in the universe, but we can detect it

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.920
with these microwave telescopes.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.570
These microwaves were actually found by accident.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.310
Two radio astronomers, Penzias and Wilson,
were actually trying to take radio images

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.590
of certain things in the sky, stars and galaxies,
but they found there was this annoying background

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.780
noise when they tried to make their measurements.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.400
So they thought maybe there wasn’t a cable
connected correctly or maybe it was bird poop.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.030
But it turned out it was actually the signal
from the early universe.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.140
And everywhere they pointed their telescope,
they saw exactly the same signal.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.330
I mean, the whole early universe was incredibly
uniform according to their observations.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.800
So the real early baby photo looks like this.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.739
That was the state of the universe at 380,000
years after the big bang.

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.079
It was uniform, so incredibly uniform everywhere.

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.310
The variations were only about one part in
100,000.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.739
So we built better telescopes and sent them
into space to try to give us the detail.

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.810
I mean, we are interested in the variation,
not just the fact that it is totally uniform.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.920
So this is the first blurry baby photo that
we took and we liked that one so much that

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.840
we built a better telescope and we got a better
image, a higher resolution image.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.790
Now you can clearly see that the early universe
has these hot spots and cold spots.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.489
And we liked that image so much that we built
an even better telescope and got an even better

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:14.489
image.

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.700
This is like the perfect baby photo.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.530
I mean, this is like seeing the eyelashes,
right?

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.489
This is so much detail.

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.079
You can see the little hot and cold spots.

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:28.299
And those are so important to our existence,
because they show that the early universe

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.359
was actually a bit lumpy.

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:35.109
There were places with slightly higher density
and places with slightly lower density.

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.909
And that is incredibly important, because
it is the places of higher density that will

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:44.790
gravitationally pull together the matter around
them clumping into stars and galaxies and

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.530
the structures that we are a part of.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.999
I mean, without a little bit of non uniformity
we could not be here, because stars and galaxies

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:56.220
would never coalesce.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.249
Now where did those lumps come from?

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:04.280
Well, they seemed to be the signature of quantum
fluctuations, or it is the idea that we are

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.930
made of quantum fields and it is impossible
to keep those quantum fields perfectly still.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.260
They are always varying, bubbling a little
bit.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.830
You know, particles popping in and out of
existence.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.290
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle says
that we cannot keep the uncertainty in energy

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.220
down to absolute zero, which means there is
always going to be some matter appearing and

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.220
disappearing.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.100
And that seems to be what created the lumpiness
in the universe that we can see.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.320
And it is that which gave rise to all these
major structures like galaxies.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.930
So we should be thankful for this sort of
crazy fluctuation because without it we could

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.110
not be here.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.020
But focusing in on the lumps, we forget that
what the true baby photo is, is of incredible

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.240
uniformity and that is the problem with this
image.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.470
It is the fact that the whole universe had
basically the same temperature 380,000 years

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.790
after the big bang and that doesn’t make
a lot of sense.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.180
I mean, why should that part of the sky be
exactly the same temperature as that part

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.180
of the sky?

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.450
It is kind of baffling.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.040
And scientists were at a loss with how do
we explain it.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.540
I mean the expectation after the big bang
is that everything would be in a massive jumble.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.620
So this incredible uniformity had to be explained
somehow.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.130
So they proposed something called inflation,
which is fairly straight forward, but a little

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.130
bit crazy.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.500
It is the idea that right after the big bang,
we may have had a totally mottled mess, right?

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.960
The big bang did not necessarily give us anything
clean or tidy.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.810
But right after the big bang all of the sudden
the universe just expanded incredibly rapidly,

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.850
like the likes of which we have never seen
again, just all of the sudden...

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.890
The whole universe got huge very fast.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.370
The inflation is proposed to have started
at this time and finished at this time after

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.370
the big bang.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.570
I am not making this stuff up.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.330
Like honestly it is nuts.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.360
But the reason that would make the universe
that we see in that baby photo is because

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.610
it would stretch out all of the wrinkles.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.490
It would create something quite uniform.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.980
I mean, imagine you are looking at a picture
of a landscape.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.180
You see all these different colors, different
structures, right?

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.420
It is very varied.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.260
Now imagine all of the sudden that photo is
expanded in front of you, like...

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.890
Now all you are going to see is one color,
because of how much that whole photo has been

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:18.890
blown up.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.790
Well, it is a very similar thing with the
universe.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:25.770
We imagine that we could see something totally
uniform and totally homogenous if right after

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.410
the big bang the whole universe just blew
up.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:36.010
But this is kind of a crazy idea created to
deal with a problem with that picture.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.090
I mean, is it really true?

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.040
Did inflation really happen or is it just
a convenient fiction we have invented to try

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.560
to explain this baby photo?

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.290
How can we ever figure out what happened before
that 380,000 year barrier?

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:52.300
I mean, we are not going to get any light
from before then.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:59.080
But maybe there is something else that we
can detect, gravitational waves.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:04.930
Now the idea of gravitational waves is that
if you wiggle a charge you get electromagnetic

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.810
radiation, because you are varying electric
and magnetic fields.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:14.120
Similarly, if you wiggle some mass, you should
get gravitational waves, because of how they

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.190
disturb the gravitational field around them.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.280
I mean, that disturbance should ripple out
through space.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.090
The problem is gravitational waves are incredibly
weak.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.690
So we have been trying to detect them for
a while.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.670
Maybe gravitational waves from two stars orbiting
each other really fast.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:34.680
But so far on earth we have not be able to
detect their existence.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.480
But here is the idea.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.960
If in that moment of inflation everything
expands out so rapidly, then the gravitational

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:48.640
waves from that moment would stretch and squeeze
all of the matter in the early universe.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.070
And scientists thought we may be able to see
the impact of those gravitational waves on

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.280
the baby photo of the universe.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.290
But what we would need to take is an image
so pristine that it not only records where

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:05.930
the hot and cold spots are, it also records
the polarization of the light.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:11.690
Now the polarization is basically just the
way that the electric field of the light is

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:12.690
oscillating.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:16.220
So it can oscillate back and forth this way
or it can oscillate back and forth this way.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.250
The idea is we can model what gravitational
waves should do.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:25.060
They should create a kind of swirl in the
polarization around these hot and cold spots.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:30.700
We know exactly what it should look like and
that is what scientists have done.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:37.459
They measured the polarization of the light
coming away from the 380,000 years after the

00:08:37.459 --> 00:08:39.909
big bang, all that plasma.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:42.659
And what did they find?

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:48.459
Exactly what thy predicted would happen if
inflation did occur and gravitational waves

00:08:48.459 --> 00:08:51.480
have affected the plasma of the early universe.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.350
That is what everyone is so excited about.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:09:00.620
Essentially we are seeing that what we thought
was true at the very tiny fraction of a second

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:07.240
after the big bang, we can see its signature
in light that is only arriving at the earth

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.410
right now.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:15.779
And what is more, we know that quantum gravity
must work, in a way, because that is the earliest

00:09:15.779 --> 00:09:21.430
sign that general relativity and quantum mechanics
are working together, something we haven’t

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.060
been able to demonstrate before now.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:30.279
So this is one of the hugest discoveries in
science of all time and certainly my lifetime.

00:09:30.279 --> 00:09:34.981
It is a fun time to be learning about science
and thinking about our universe, because we

00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:44.370
are just getting new clues into how our whole
universe was born.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:48.860
When you look at all of the incredible things
in the universe, the galaxies, stars, black

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:53.920
holes, the earth, people, plants, computers,
the internet, just think to yourself, in the

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:59.279
words of Carl Sagan: These are some of the
things that hydrogen atoms do when given 14

00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:00.939
billion years of cosmic evolution.

00:10:00.939 --> 00:10:05.700
And, in fact, one of the things they do is
create a website where you can download information

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.610
at the click of a button.

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:12.460
Audible.com is one of the leading providers
of audio books with a vast range of titles,

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.019
over 150,000.

00:10:14.019 --> 00:10:18.680
And this week I wanted to recommend a book
by Carl Sagan called Contact which I absolutely

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:23.259
love, because I feel like he correctly sort
of describes the experience of what it is

00:10:23.259 --> 00:10:24.610
like to be a young scientist.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:26.670
I could really relate to the main character.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:30.160
So if you are into science and you haven’t
read or listened to this yet, you definitely

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.160
need to.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.860
And you can download it for free by going
to Audible.com/Veritasium or you can pick

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.600
any other book of your choosing for a one
month free trial.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.620
So I want to thank Audible for supporting
me and I want to thank you for watching.
