00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.139
- Just press play, you mean?

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.900
- [Voiceover] Yeah, go for it. Whoa!

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:14.800
[Music]

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.419
- Now, you may have seen a Ruben's tube before.
That's basically a pipe with a bunch of holes

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:24.409
in it, and you pump in a flammable gas, and
light it on fire, so you basically create

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:28.800
a row of Bunsen burners. What's really cool
is to play some sounds into the tube, and

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.410
you can actually set up standing waves. That
is, there are areas, there are patterns of

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.080
the vibration of the air where there's a lot
of vibration in some parts, and not very much

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.710
vibration in other parts. Now, that affects
the flow rate of the gas inside that tube

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.000
into the atmosphere, and so it affects the
height of those flames. So basically, you

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.700
can visualize the standing wave pattern. I'm
currently in Denmark with a team of physics

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.010
and chemistry demonstrators who have taken
this experiment to the next level. They've

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.070
actually created a two-dimensional Ruben's
tube, a whole plane of Bunsen burners, effectively.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.870
How many holes in this tube?

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.659
- 2,500

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.950
- [Voiceover] 2,500 in this Pyro Board?

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:07.189
- Yeah

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.280
- [Voiceover] So we're gonna see 2,500 little
flames. Yeah. So, do you want to light it

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.860
up?

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.530
- Yes, I really want to light it up.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.480
- [Voiceover] Why did you make this?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.020
- Because, we really liked the Ruben's tube,
but then we thought, "when you put on more
fire, then it always gets better."

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.840
Let's just turn [the frequency] down

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.380
...and then we can just find the standing wave.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.540
So, this is below the normal standing wave

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.100
- [Voiceover] So what are we seeing here?

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.020
- It's pretty much like the standing wave
on the Ruben's tube. It's just in this direction.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.540
This is the lowest frequency that makes a
standing wave in this pulse.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.340
- [Voiceover] So this is like the fundamental.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.220
- It's the fundamental.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.440
- [Voiceover] Can you show me what happens
when you vary the volume a little bit?

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.280
- [Voiceover] Whoa! That was awesome. Okay,
should we try to find another standing wave?

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.460
- Yes

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.420
You can see it. You can see
it. You can hear it before you can see it.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.740
- Woah

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.860
- [Voiceover] It's weird. With the microphones,
I can actually hear, like here, I'm in a node.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.020
And then here, I'm in an anti-node. Here I'm in
a node.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.080
- [Sune] Because you can measure the sound
pressure?

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.200
- [Voiceover] I can hear it. Like here is
very much an anti-node.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.540
- [Sune] I never thought about that.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.700
- [Voiceover] This is a node, and you guys
can hear it.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.700
- [Sune] That's true.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.860
- [Voiceover] It's incredible. The flames
must be coming out in the anti-nodes.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.340
- The flames are coming up in the anti-nodes,
yeah.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.740
- [Voiceover] And you can even hear it. Thatâ€™s
incredible.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.320
- Yeah It's nice that it can do that.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.459
- [Voiceover] That is awesome.

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.000
- [Sune] We just learned something.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.440
- [Voiceover] What happens if we try to go
higher frequency?

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.150
- [Sune] Yeah. We have something. Oh, that's
a good one.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.740
- [Voiceover] That is crazy. We're right in
the anti-node.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.080
- [Sune] Is your ears okay?

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.080
- [Voiceover] Oh, God!

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.000
- My ears are hurting now.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.840
- [Voiceover] That was painful. Why don't
we try to put something more pleasing to the

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.760
ear through the speaker and see what happens.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.260
- I think that's a good idea.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.560
- [Voiceover] Let's put some music on there.
You ready?

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.140
- Go.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:05:03.260
[Music with bass thumping]

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.660
- So, you go around Denmark showing kids all
about physics?

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.500
- We do. That's what we do.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.930
- You show them the Pyro Board?

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.500
- We show them the Pyro Board, and we show
them a whole lot of other stuff.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.140
- You guys are also on YouTube?

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.500
- Yep, we have a YouTube channel. You can
go to this link, right here.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.370
- Go check it out if you want to see more
of what these guys are up to. It's awesome.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.880
- [Sune] It's great.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.800
- Ahoy. That is the actual Czech word for
hello. I have made it to Olomouc in the Czech

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.680
Republic, and this is partly thanks to support
from Audible.com, the leading provider of

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.180
audio books, with over 150,000 titles in all
areas of literature, including fiction, non-fiction,

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.610
and periodicals. Now, today I wanted to recommend
a book, which is a little bit European, and

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.150
it's called Galileo's Daughter by Dava Sobel.
I love this book because it includes the actual

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.860
letters written from Galileo's daughter to
him during his life, and it really reveals

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.010
what he must have gone through as a human
being. We all know about his science, and

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.080
about the trials that he went through, but
to see this kind of insight into his personal

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.139
life, I think is remarkable, so you should
really check out this book, and you can download

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:10.669
it for free by going to audible.com/veritasium,
or you can pick any other book of your choosing

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:14.669
for a one month free trial. So I really want
to thank Audible for supporting me, and allowing

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:20.980
me to go and meet great scientists, and filmmakers,
and lots of people all around the world. Also,

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.620
I should note that I will be hosting Michio
Kaku in Brisbane and Melbourne on June 5th

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.730
and 6th. Links in the doobly-doo. I would
love to see you there. Thank you so much for

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.870
watching, and I will see you somewhere else
in the world. Bye.
