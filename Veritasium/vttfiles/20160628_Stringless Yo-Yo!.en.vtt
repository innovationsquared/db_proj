00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.060
- Can you just like ... Yo-Yo like a basic Yo-Yo
- Yeah, like this

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.400
- But this is not a basic Yo-Yo

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.400
No

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.020
That is awesome

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.560
Nicely done!

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.060
This is Ben Conde, he's got 
a brand new channel on YouTube

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.880
Which is about Yo-Yoing
like a crazy person

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.800
But, I'm going to figure out
how this is possible

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.440
How this is possible with a string
that's not connected to the Yo-Yo

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.420
To get it to do all
of these insane things

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.490
Wow

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.840
Gosh!

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.310
How did you learn to do that?
That's crazy!

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.230
Uh

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.550
Just a lot of like lonely saturday nights

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.920
So watch this motion here, there, and then you tug up

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.820
-Yeah you got it
-(Derek Laughs) This is not gonna happen!

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.660
You got it, dude!

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.860
Pull up- ooooh, that was close!

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.780
Tug up! Aww...

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.420
-Pull up! There you go! -(Derek cheers)

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.979
So, how does this work? When the yo-yo is
released it unspools as it falls,

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.670
gaining kinetic energy and rotational
energy from the gravitational potential

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.759
energy it had to start with yo-yos can
spin really fast, around six thousand

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.259
revolutions per minute.

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.250
That's about as fast as most car engines
can turn over, and this is important

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.179
because it gives the yo-yo gyroscopic
stability which means its axis of

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:36.440
rotation is maintained even if there's a
breeze or some little disturbances

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.770
now since the yo-yo has a lot of angular
momentum it continues spinning in the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.590
same direction but when Ben tugs the
string

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.459
he pulls it from one side of the yo-yo
over to the other so now as the yo-yo

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:50.939
continues spinning it binds the string to
the spool and starts to roll up the string

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.040
If you look closely at this shot
you can actually see the exact moment

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.070
when the string binds to the spool
preventing the yo-yo from unravelling

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.070
further and falling off the string.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.180
That's all there is to it, yeah,
there's no science behind it at all.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.580
To release the
yo-yo Ben throws it out and upwards

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.080
without pulling back so it completely
unspools and continues spinning at the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.180
same high rate of rotation, but how does
he catch it with just a string?

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.780
So the way yo-yos actually do roll up is
there's friction pads inside the yo-yo

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.980
these ones are made out of silicone you
see this like little gap that inside

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.730
when that string goes inside that
creates friction and while it's spinning

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.130
it rolls the yo-yo up

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.190
So if Ben can lodge the string in the
gap of the yo-yo

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.580
it catches on the friction pads and the
yo-yo starts to roll up the string again

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.450
Even without the friction pads when the
string wraps around the axle it

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.020
creates a significant amount of friction
in the same way that ropes wrapped

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.790
around bollards hold big ships to their
docks, the amount of tension a coiled rope

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.800
or string can hold is given by the belt
friction equation. This equation shows

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.490
that the force the string can exert on
the yo-yo increases exponentially with

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.390
the angle the string makes around the
axle so even a few turns around the

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.360
yo-yo allow been to pull it back into
his hand

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.140
(Derek): What is your favorite yo-yo moment?

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.800
My freestyle in 2011 the crowd stood up
and it felt good

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.140
It brought tears to my eyes but I went back
to my hotel room to cry 'cause I was happy

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.020
It was a good moment

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.950

In the book i'm listening to at the

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.600
moment is a classic of science fiction
it's Kurt Vonnegut's slaughterhouse-five

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.380
an awesome book about becoming unstuck
from time it involves aliens and world

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.039
war two and kind of this weird time
travel but it's just a phenomenal piece

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.190
of writing so if you haven't read it or
listened to it and you can check it out

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.750
for one month free trial just go to
audible.com/veritasium I really

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.289
want to thank audible for supporting me
and I also want to thank Darren Dyke who

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.199

video

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.160
he is phenomenal that's why this video
is so cool and also of course Ben Conde

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.550
because he spent years of his life
perfecting the skills that you saw

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.560
demonstrated here if you want to see
more of him
