00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:08.360
- I'm actually gonna use my arm so I can high-five
so many people, 106.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.520
- You're gonna high-five 106 people?

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.520
- Yeah.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.600
- Aren't you gonna get tired?

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.059
- No, because my robo-arm's going to do all
the work.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.000
- Alex was born without a fully formed arm.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.189
A condition that affects around 1,500 babies
born in the U.S. every year.

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.619
I'm here to see him get fitted with a new
arm.

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.970
We have come a long way in the development
of prosthetic limbs.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.140
You might think of the earliest prosthetic
as maybe a peg-leg for a sailor, but it actually

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.050
dates back much further than that.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.260
In fact, over 3,000 years ago to Ancient Egypt.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.559
The thought was that our lives have a finite
length, but that the after-life is eternal.

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.359
And according to the theology of Osiris, the
body needed to be complete, because the soul

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:55.640
would leave the body, in theory, and every
night, come back to replenish its energy in

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.640
the body.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.399
And it was so important that that body be
full.

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:06.390
And so there are many instances of prosthetic
noses, ears, toes, and limbs, which were used

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.520
in Ancient Egypt to ensure that the body was
complete.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.799
But a lot of those prosthetics weren't actually
functional.

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.500
So prosthetics developed from simply being
aesthetic aids to actually becoming functional.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.700
Globally, there are an estimated 3 million
people living without an upper limb.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.110
Over the last 10 to 20 years, we've seen remarkable
advancement in the development of bionic limbs.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.840
The problem with these prostheses, is they
typically cost on the order of $20,000 to

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.840
$100,000.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.890
Now, here at UCF, they're building an arm
which can be used and manufactured for much,

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.299
much cheaper, like 1% of that cost.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.380
How did you get inspired to design an arm
for children?

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.299
- I was on my way to work, and I was listening
to the radio, and there was an interview with

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.719
the person who developed the first 3D-printed
hand.

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:02.979
And I went into my research lab and I said
I have to be a part of this, what can I do

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:03.979
to help?

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.400
And then we had Alex's parents contact us
directly saying, "Can you build our son an

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.400
arm?"

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.680
- The arm itself is completely 3D-printed
and so are the joints between the fingers.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.420
So there's a cable which runs down the length
of each finger and back into the hand.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.870
They would normally be connected up to this
servo motor, here.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.030
Now the idea is to trigger this motor via
the arm of the person who's wearing it.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.200
So they would wear three electrodes on their
upper arm.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.569
When the person wearing the arm squeezes their
muscle, there's a little electrical pulse,

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.750
which triggers this motor to pull in 180 degrees.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.950
One pulse will close the hand, like this,
and then another pulse will relax it, so it

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:42.950
opens back up.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.769
- Our arm provides a level of self-confidence
to the children.

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.630
Whenever they're going to school there's questions
asked, like "what happened to your arm?

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.040
Did you get bit by a shark or run over by
a car or something?"

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.240
After we gave them the arm it quickly changed
to "whoa, that's a cool arm!

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.240
How does it work?

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.240
Where did you get it?"

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.240
- I like to do stuff with my arm.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:04.099
Like, pick up stuff, hold my paper when I'm
drawin' I actually bring it to school so I

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.350
can actually do other stuff.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.739
- 3D printing is relatively new technology
but it provides us a low-cost solution to

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.610
be able to create things so we can print something
out and say, it doesn't work, and just redesign

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.019
it and print it out again the next day.

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.049
We produce our arm for just about $300 now,
whereas some of the prosthetics on the market

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.970
can go upwards of $40,000.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.681
Insurance companies typically don't want to
pay for it for kids because every six months,

00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:28.580
they're going to have to replace it as the
kid grows.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.090
But this allows us to be able to reproduce
an arm for about maybe $100 and just print

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.090
out a new one.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.299
- How important is the aesthetic design, the
artistic design of the arm?

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.360
- We thought kids just wanted to blend in,
to feel normal, but we found it's much more

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.340
about personal identity and expression.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.159
- We want to make sure the kid is expressing
himself, or herself, with the arm.

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.839
Self expression for a kid is very important.

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:50.230
- We have one sleeve right here.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.209
This one is actually themed around the Disney
movie Tangled, we provided this for a little

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.209
girl named Madeline.

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.549
- The design is so simple that it is easy
to print out on location and put together

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.680
even with very little technical knowledge.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.019
And also the functionality of the design,
with only three electrodes actuating the one

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.750
servo, make it so that people can learn to
use it very quickly.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.680
And that, I think, is what makes it so powerful.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.750
- Think I'll have any luck there?

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.750
50/50?

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.750
- 50/50.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:15.750
Alright!

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.320
- Look at that, I can give it to you.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.320
- Yup.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.550
- I'm really excited right now about trying
it out, and how to do summersaults, and do

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.850
some things I've never done before.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.010
I want to play video games with it and hug
with two hands.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.860
- How have you been able to crack this problem
that other people haven't before?

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.930
- We have an incredible team of very diverse
backgrounds.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.852
And so bringing all of our common experience
together, we were able to find this type of

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:46.852
solution.

00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:49.260
Our main base is in Orlando, Florida at the
University of Central Florida.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.340
We have our designers in California, I'm here
in Germany, and everywhere in between, we

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.180
have people trying to help us and support
our project.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.640
Although it's challenging, we're making it
work.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.500
- A lot of our communication comes through
Microsoft OneNote, and we use this product

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.440
to be able to share information through each
other, specifically since Albert is in Germany

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.950
so that's a whole ocean away.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.801
- [Albert] I think the best part of OneNote
is that you can edit it from anywhere in the

00:05:12.801 --> 00:05:16.660
world and have it simultaneously update anyone
else on the project.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.310
So being able to get updates from my team
and see the progress they're making, enables

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.520
me to help do my job here in Germany.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.889
- What is the Collective Project?

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.400
- Microsoft is looking for students who are
wanting to impact their community with great

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.400
ideas.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.071
And they're looking to rally their communities
and the world around them to help bring it

00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:34.071
to life.

00:05:34.071 --> 00:05:37.220
- Our biggest needs right now is one, we need
funding.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.500
We need more donations to be able to make
this a reality and make these children's dreams

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.500
come true.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.180
- You want to provide free arms to every kid
who needs one.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.840
- Absolutely, we don't feel like people should
profit from a child without an arm.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.740
- We're hoping for people that jump on board
and help develop arms for their local area,

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.730
if they want to help with design, they're
more than welcome to join our project and

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:57.730
be designing arms.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:02.520
They can be printing our arms, and helping
fit them for their local community, or they

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.490
can just send us advice on how to best tailor
these for the future.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.190
We can use all the help we can get.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.000
- Where do you want to see the Limbitless
Arm go?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.220
- My hope for the future is to be able to
increase the functionality of the arm to encompass

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.120
maybe an elbow or even an upper limb socket.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.530
And then be able to produce this on a larger
scale for as many children in the world who

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.530
need it.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.380
- As each child comes to us, we really understand
and appreciate the need for the readily adaptable,

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.090
readily deployable solution to each individual
and unique biology.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:41.400
- We're trying to get an elbow going for Alex
so he has not only hand movement but he can

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.200
also move the elbow as well.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.940
To overcome that we have to make this also
bigger to be able to put another servo in

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:47.940
there.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.940
We like ideas.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.990
Not just, this is our way this is how it has
to be.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.990
Anything's possible.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.950
We like to broaden our field as well.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.960
- I think we're just at the beginning of something
really great and I hope that with a little

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.400
bit of help we're going to be able to take
this to the UN and UNICEF and really impact

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.840
children all over the world.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.050
- Thank you guys for making this big project
for me.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.840
- That's fantastic, thank you so much for
chatting with me.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.980
- Thank you!

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.830
- Ah, haha, you're very welcome.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.340
This video was supported by Microsoft OneNote.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.890
In their Collective Project, they have identified
student groups around the country who are

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.360
working together, using their software in
order to change the world.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.860
And the whole point of the Collective Project
is to bring people together and you can get

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.440
involved as well by clicking on the link in
the description, you could help by providing

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.770
new designs for arms, by helping with software
or even 3D printing in your own community.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:42.130
And that will help get more of these arms
out to the kids who need them.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.720
So, I really want you to get involved, check
out the link in the description.
