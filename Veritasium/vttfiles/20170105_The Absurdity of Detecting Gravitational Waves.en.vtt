00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.880
1.3 billion years ago

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.840
in a galaxy far, far away

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.140
two black holes merged

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.880
As they violently spiraled into each other

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.980
They created traveling distortions in the fabric of space-time

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.680
gravitational waves

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.580
in the last tenth of a second

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.340
the energy released in these waves

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.000
was 50 times greater

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.340
then the energy being released by everything else

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.160
in the observable universe combined

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.060
It's like an awe-inspiring kind of energy

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.780
after spreading out through the universe at the speed of light for over a billion years

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.900
the waves reached earth, where they stretched and squeezed space

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.600
such that two light beams traveling in perpendicular pipes were put slightly out of step

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.860
allowing humans to detect the existence of

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.260
gravitational waves for the first time.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.340
That's a simple enough story to tell but

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.880
what I found out when I went to visit

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.550
professor Rana Adhikari at Caltech is

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.070
that it hides the absurdity of just what

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.230
was required to make that detection.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.000
There's a lot of things about

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.820
gravitational waves which are absurd

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.300
*Humming simulation of gravitational waves

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.980
Is that.... is that it? [RA]: That's it, yeah.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.979
The main problem with detecting

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.980
gravitational waves is that they're tiny

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.020
they stretched and squeezed space by

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.759
just one part in 10 to the 21.

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.320
That's the equivalent of measuring the

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.780
distance between here and Alpha Centauri

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.720
and then trying to measure variations in

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.960
that distance that are the width of a human hair.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.720
To detect such tiny wiggles

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.130
you have to measure over as large

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.899
distance as possible, which is why the

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.030
arms of the interferometers are four

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.670
kilometers. And even with arms this long

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.290
gravitational waves vary the length of

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.720
the arms by at most 10 to the minus 18 meters

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.780
so the detector has to be able to

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.150
reliably measure distances just 1/10000

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.820
the width of a proton. It's the tiniest

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.680
measurement ever made.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.180
So how is it possible to measure that

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.740
considering all the other sources of

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.450
vibrations and noise in the environment,

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.630
like earthquakes, traffic, and electrical storms.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.540
Well for one thing the mirrors are the

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.350
smoothest ever created.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.959
They weigh 40 kilograms or 90 pounds and

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.390
are suspended by silica threads just

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.910
twice the thickness of a hair to isolate

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.570
them from their environment

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.280
and even then the only way to be certain not to

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.269
be tricked by environmental noise was to

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.280
build two detectors far apart from each other

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.560
in reasonably quiet locations that

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.180
allows you to distinguish between local

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.830
noise which would appear only one side

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.780
and gravitational waves which would pass

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.560
through both sides

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.580
almost simultaneously

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.140
I'm in a building that contains a 1 to 100 scale

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.600
of LIGO, the gravitational wave detector.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.300
The next challenge is the laser.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.780
Whoa, whoa.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.000
That's a lot of stuff.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.960
You need a laser that can provide one, and exactly one wavelength.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.040
You can imagine, if your laser

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.959
wavelength is changing and you're trying

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.730
to use interference of light waves to

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.290
make this measurement it's never going

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.090
to work because it's something like

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.770
trying to measure this distance but your

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.510
ruler stick is constantly changing back

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.810
and forth you can't tell how many inches this is.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.020
All this equipment, at least

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.920
three-quarters of it, all we're trying to

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.110
do is make the laser more stable, and by

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.910
the end of the day what we've achieved

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.400
is something which has a stability of

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.269
one part in 10 to the 20. What does that mean...

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.760
That's a hundred billionth of a trillion.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.380
That's kind of what we end up with.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.900
The best lasers for this purpose have a

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.640
wavelength of 1064 nanometers. That's

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.500
infrared light. But this presents a problem.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.560
How can you measure 10 to the minus 18 with 10 to the minus 6

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.410
wavelength of light?

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.220
Yes, I wish more people would ask this question.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.459
It's great for this animation

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.140
to show such a large shift in the

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.510
wavelength but the reality is, it's only

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.760
one trillionth of a wavelength that the

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.780
arms are shifting in length.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.200
It seems obvious that you can measure half a

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.030
wavelength because that will cause the

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.350
light to interfere with itself.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.790
Yeah, but that's fully. That will go from

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.600
completely dark to completely bright

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.260
So are you looking at, like, slightly darker

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.730
and slightly brighter?

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.670
Yeah and the limit here at how good we

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.829
can measure this difference between dark

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.890
and bright has to do with the, the fact

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.299
that the light is discrete. It comes in

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.039
discrete chunks which are called photons.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.140
The variation in the number of photons

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.729
hitting the mirrors at any instant due

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.890
this quantum uncertainty is proportional

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.990
to the square root of the total number

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.510
of photons. What this means is the more

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.850
photons you use, the smaller the

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.450
uncertainty gets, that's a fraction of the total.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.860
This is why the laser power in the arms is one megawatt.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.520
That is enough energy to power a thousand homes, in a light beam.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.480
And a megawatt, you know

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.440
*snap* boom, they won't even rip your head off.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.110
Just, vaporized be just a smoking stump.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.880
Even with a perfect laser and one

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.680
megawatt of power, anything the light

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.240
hits would interfere with it,

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.880
even the air, so all the air in the arms

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.940
of the detectors had to be eliminated

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.820
and it took 40 days to pump down to just

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.400
a trillionth of atmospheric pressure and

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.030
the tubes were heated up to the

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.190
temperature of the oven to expel any residual gases.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.560
They pumped out enough

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.570
air to fill up two and a half million

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.850
footballs, making it the second largest

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.840
vacuum in the world after the Large Hadron Collider.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.700
Now here's something most people don't think about

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.720
which is that gravitational waves stretch

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.120
space-time so light traveling through

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.700
that space should be stretched as well.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.860
If everything is stretching how do you

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.000
know anything is stretching?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.960
How do you know anything is stretching?

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.900
That's the conundrum.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.940
It doesn't make any sense!

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.900
This whole thing is bogus shut it down!

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.100
I would send a laser beam down this tube

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.120
and then wait for it to come back and

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.040
then i would say "well nothing happened"

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.820
because the space got stretched and the

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.350
laser wavelength got stretched

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.850
Its...It looks the same if you got it stretched or not stretched.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.260
It doesn't make any sense

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.480
well it's sort of a matter of timing is

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.320
how it works.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.240
So the amount of time it takes for light

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.260
to go down this tube and come back is

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.190
very short.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.200
However the wave... the gravitational wave

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.980
when it comes through its doing the slow thing like

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.440
*low humming*

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.820
this noise I made, which is low. Its this

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.680
it's this slow stretching, its only a

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.630
hundred times per second. And it's true

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.420
when the wave comes through the light

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.120
which is in there it actually does get stretched.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.000
And... and then that part doesn't...

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.130
doesn't do the measurement for us but

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.900
um.. now that the space is stretched that

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.700
laser light is like come and gone

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.860
it's out of the picture. We're constantly shooting

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.510
the laser back into the system so the

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.970
new fresh light now goes through there

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.610
and has to travel a bigger distance than the light before.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.920
And so by looking at how this interference changes with time

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.280
and keeping the laser wavelength from

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.260
the laser itself fixed, we're able to do the measurement.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.180
So what was needed to detect gravitational waves?

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.290
Well, a megawatt of laser power to

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.250
minimize shot noise of exactly one wavelength

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.960
because we're trying to measure just a trillionth of that wavelength,

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.360
continually inserted to replace older light

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.000
that's been stretched and squished,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.700
in the world's second-largest vacuum chamber at just a

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.210
trillionth of atmospheric pressure,

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.580
hitting the smoothest mirrors ever created,

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.300
suspended by silica threads,

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.360
at two distant sites to eliminate noise,

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.940
with four kilometer long arms to

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.690
increase the magnitude of gravitational

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.970
waves to just a thousand of the width of a proton.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.700
You know what we already do

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.480
daily in here is what I would have said

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.450
is impossible if you asked me about it 20 years ago.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.480
One of the things that was

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.280
most interesting for me to learn was

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.260
what is limiting the sensitivity of the

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.450
detectors today, and it turns out it is

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.910
quantum mechanics and essentially you can think of it

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:42.660
like a Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we've got two

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:44.860
things and together their uncertainty

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.900
has to be bigger than a certain value.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.790
Luckily for us we are only trying to

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.140
measure one thing here, we're not trying

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.620
to measure two things at the same time.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.460
All we want to know is how much more

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.100
this arm get stretched from that arm

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.300
and that's... that's the key point which people

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.080
did not understand until recently.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.800
The way to build these systems is such that

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.240
they're extremely good in measuring one

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.010
thing and that all of the uncertainty

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.680
which comes from quantum mechanics is

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.930
completely crammed into this other thing

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.010
that we don't care about.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.740
I feel like we're getting down to these levels of

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.360
nature where it seems like nature

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.080
doesn't want you to go any further.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.640
But, through our ingenuity we're figuring out

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:24.010
ways to engineer quantum noise, I think

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.600
that's such a remarkable concept

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.500
and I look forward to the results

00:08:27.509 --> 00:08:28.920
that it's going to bring.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.340
I think the next logical step is to go from

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.139
two signals to detecting all the black holes

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:35.879
in the universe all the time.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.160
It's not like an alien civilization level of

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.940
technology it's just... we have to do a lot better

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:42.860
than what we're doing now but it's

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.500
I see it sort of within... within our grasp
