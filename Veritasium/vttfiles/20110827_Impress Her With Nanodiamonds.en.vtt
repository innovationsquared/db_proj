00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.520
Want to spoil your girlfriend with diamonds
while impressing her with your scientific

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.520
knowledge.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.629
Here's how:
Baby, we've been together a long time

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:16.750
and I've picked up on your hints -- I know
that you want a diamond,

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.900
but I was thinking
you're too special to me for just one diamond.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.520
I want to give you one and a half million
diamonds...

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.930
per second.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.710
And not only that, they're nanodiamonds.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.710
really?

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.070
Yeah, isn't that great?

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.070
Nanodiamonds.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.510
You are a fu-
Now is the perfect time to tell her scientists

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.429
have recently discovered nanodiamonds in the
flames of ordinary candles -- millions of

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:51.449
them!

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.969
As the hydrocarbon wax is burned tiny diamonds
form in the middle of the flame.

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:56.969
What?

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.499
They're the exact same as regular diamonds,
just really, really small.

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:02.229
You always told me size doesn't matter.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.809
Are you packing?

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.120
I should have listened to my mother.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.970
Actually, as it turns out, the nanodiamonds
are burnt up in the flame and released into

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.140
the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.110
So you're better off getting a big diamond.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.750
Otherwise your relationship, like the nanodiamonds,
will go up in smoke.
