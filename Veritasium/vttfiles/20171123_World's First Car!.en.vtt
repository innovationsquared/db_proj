00:00:00.123 --> 00:00:04.547
- I am about to drive
the world's first car.

00:00:04.547 --> 00:00:08.728
This was invented by Karl
Benz, patented in 1886.

00:00:08.728 --> 00:00:12.063
Of course, this is not the
real thing, this is a replica.

00:00:12.063 --> 00:00:14.506
But I've partnered with Mercedes

00:00:14.506 --> 00:00:17.427
to make a video about car safety.

00:00:17.427 --> 00:00:18.486
- Yeah. (laughs)

00:00:18.486 --> 00:00:19.319
- Right?

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:20.195
There's not a lot of safety here.

00:00:20.195 --> 00:00:21.495
Safety would come later.

00:00:21.495 --> 00:00:22.431
You ready?

00:00:22.431 --> 00:00:23.325
- Yeah!

00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:24.158
I trust you.

00:00:24.158 --> 00:00:26.960
(engine sputters slowly)

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.233
Awesome!

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:32.213
- I'm driving the world's
first motor vehicle.

00:00:32.213 --> 00:00:36.754
When he made his patent, what
did he call this invention?

00:00:36.754 --> 00:00:38.341
- Patent Motorcar.

00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:40.005
This is the gasoline tank.

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:42.214
The only place in Germany
where you could actually buy

00:00:42.214 --> 00:00:45.787
ligroin, or gasoline,
back then were pharmacies.

00:00:45.787 --> 00:00:49.119
They sold it not as a cough
medicine, don't worry.

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:52.046
They sold it as a stain
remover, a washing agent.

00:00:52.046 --> 00:00:54.845
In Germany, there's still
a word, Waschbenzin,

00:00:54.845 --> 00:00:57.117
washing gasoline, but no one really knows

00:00:57.117 --> 00:00:58.338
why it's called like that.

00:00:58.338 --> 00:01:00.126
Benz had an early thing for safety.

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:01.788
His ignition is a really modern one,

00:01:01.788 --> 00:01:05.075
because in here there's a battery inside

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:06.903
which was fairly new back then.

00:01:06.903 --> 00:01:11.090
And, of course, igniting
the gasoline oxygen fumes

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.445
with an electric spark is much safer than

00:01:14.445 --> 00:01:16.549
if you go with your lighter there

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.429
and you're trying to ignite a whole thing.

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:21.741
Let's say the most
important part, or course,

00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:23.324
is the cylinder with the piston.

00:01:23.324 --> 00:01:25.644
And the piston moves front and back.

00:01:25.644 --> 00:01:27.880
- This is a single cylinder engine.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.342
- Yeah, a single cylinder engine.

00:01:29.342 --> 00:01:31.297
This is the cooling water tank,

00:01:31.297 --> 00:01:33.203
and of course what's really important,

00:01:33.203 --> 00:01:34.761
it's the oil reservoir.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.010
Lubrication is really
important, because you can see

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.693
everything's open here,

00:01:38.693 --> 00:01:41.365
and so all the time you lose a lot of oil,

00:01:41.365 --> 00:01:42.905
and for my colleagues it's always

00:01:42.905 --> 00:01:45.537
a big fuss cleaning this thing up.

00:01:45.537 --> 00:01:46.795
This the drive belt.

00:01:46.795 --> 00:01:47.628
- Right.

00:01:47.628 --> 00:01:49.716
- It's not just a drive
belt, it's also your brake.

00:01:49.716 --> 00:01:52.596
It's leather, so you can
imagine if you do brake a lot

00:01:52.596 --> 00:01:54.465
you get problems with the leather band.

00:01:54.465 --> 00:01:58.644
The flywheel here we
need for the ignition.

00:01:58.644 --> 00:02:00.561
We need it to start it.

00:02:02.797 --> 00:02:05.630
(engine sputters)

00:02:16.096 --> 00:02:16.929
- Wow!

00:02:18.177 --> 00:02:19.010
(laughs)

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.019
- Okay, see, that's really simple.

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.640
We don't have a lot of stuff here.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.473
- Yeah.

00:02:23.473 --> 00:02:26.257
- We just have the steering crank,

00:02:26.257 --> 00:02:29.465
and this is our gas and our brakes.

00:02:29.465 --> 00:02:31.577
- Okay, you're moving us into gear.

00:02:31.577 --> 00:02:32.511
- Yeah.

00:02:32.511 --> 00:02:33.569
- Whoa!

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:34.993
(engine sputters)

00:02:34.993 --> 00:02:36.092
This does feel fast.

00:02:36.092 --> 00:02:38.041
- Oh, it even goes, ahh, faster.

00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:40.481
- Whoa! (both laugh)

00:02:40.481 --> 00:02:44.460
The top speed of this vehicle
was 16 kilometers per hour,

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.126
that's about 10 miles an hour.

00:02:46.126 --> 00:02:47.301
- We can go fast.

00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:49.213
- It feels faster than I was expecting.

00:02:49.213 --> 00:02:51.771
(engine sputters)

00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:53.599
Just 16 years later,

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.868
this car could go 80 kilometers per hour.

00:02:56.868 --> 00:03:01.035
This car in 1928 could already
go 192 kilometers per hour.

00:03:02.812 --> 00:03:06.696
By 1938, cars had gotten incredibly fast.

00:03:06.696 --> 00:03:08.680
This car right here set a record of

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.847
432.7 kilometers per hour.

00:03:11.723 --> 00:03:14.443
That's almost 270 miles per hour,

00:03:14.443 --> 00:03:16.676
and another driver trying
to beat that record

00:03:16.676 --> 00:03:18.701
died the same day.

00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:22.868
And to this day, no one has
beat that car on a public road.

00:03:24.674 --> 00:03:27.558
The automobile revolutionized
transportation.

00:03:27.558 --> 00:03:30.888
It allowed people to travel
faster than ever before.

00:03:30.888 --> 00:03:34.200
But that also created a really
difficult physics problem,

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.931
which is that if you're moving
fast and you need to stop

00:03:36.931 --> 00:03:38.389
or you hit something,

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.775
you have to decelerate incredibly rapidly

00:03:40.775 --> 00:03:44.416
and that creates huge forces
on the people inside the car,

00:03:44.416 --> 00:03:46.567
and causing injury and sometimes death.

00:03:46.567 --> 00:03:48.797
And as more and more cars came on the road

00:03:48.797 --> 00:03:50.666
and traveled faster and faster,

00:03:50.666 --> 00:03:53.106
the number of fatalities increased,

00:03:53.106 --> 00:03:56.234
peaking in a lot of developed
nations in the '70s.

00:03:56.234 --> 00:03:59.523
But then scientists and
engineers embraced this challenge

00:03:59.523 --> 00:04:01.946
and figured out new, innovative ways

00:04:01.946 --> 00:04:04.987
to create cars to minimize those injuries.

00:04:04.987 --> 00:04:07.547
To improve safety, regular crash testing

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:09.662
began in the late 1950s.

00:04:09.662 --> 00:04:10.964
But what amazes me is,

00:04:10.964 --> 00:04:13.691
the crash test dummy really
hadn't been perfected yet.

00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:15.686
So actual scientists and engineers

00:04:15.686 --> 00:04:16.519
drove the cars in crash tests.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.955
- People like me actually started

00:04:19.955 --> 00:04:23.129
to do first testing with themselves.

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:25.920
Certain accelerations,
how much you can suffer,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.316
I mean before you get any injuries.

00:04:28.316 --> 00:04:31.119
Of course, today this
would be impossible to do.

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:34.575
- But when they finally did
develop crash test dummies,

00:04:34.575 --> 00:04:36.523
well then people weren't
driving the cars anymore

00:04:36.523 --> 00:04:39.369
so they needed a different
way to propel the vehicle.

00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:42.976
And so they used this, a hot water rocket,

00:04:42.976 --> 00:04:46.992
to propel the car into all
sorts of crash test situations.

00:04:46.992 --> 00:04:49.027
One of the first major safety innovations

00:04:49.027 --> 00:04:50.651
that was introduced in a car like this

00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:53.053
in 1959 was crumple zones.

00:04:53.053 --> 00:04:55.792
That is, regions in the
front and the rear of the car

00:04:55.792 --> 00:04:59.107
that were designed to collapse
in the event of an accident.

00:04:59.107 --> 00:05:01.453
I remember when I was a kid,
hearing about crumple zones

00:05:01.453 --> 00:05:04.658
thinking that was a ridiculous
idea to improve safety.

00:05:04.658 --> 00:05:06.768
I mean, why would you
want your car to collapse?

00:05:06.768 --> 00:05:08.759
But the point is to increase

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.803
the distance over which
the deceleration occurs,

00:05:11.803 --> 00:05:14.491
and in doing so, you
actually reduce the magnitude

00:05:14.491 --> 00:05:16.364
of the acceleration and so you reduce

00:05:16.364 --> 00:05:19.126
the forces on the passengers inside.

00:05:19.126 --> 00:05:21.607
And that is what saves lives.

00:05:21.607 --> 00:05:25.592
- This vehicle has done a
64 kilometer per hour crash,

00:05:25.592 --> 00:05:28.193
frontal impact, against
a deformable barrier.

00:05:28.193 --> 00:05:31.132
This is what we classically
call the crumple zone.

00:05:31.132 --> 00:05:35.105
- But it's this beam here
that's designed to crumple?

00:05:35.105 --> 00:05:36.160
- Exactly.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.160
So this takes away a lot
of energy by crumpling.

00:05:41.034 --> 00:05:44.051
The passenger compartment
itself is designed with

00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:46.612
different steel qualities, if you want,

00:05:46.612 --> 00:05:49.292
high strength and ultra
high strength materials,

00:05:49.292 --> 00:05:52.947
so that it's getting stiffer
and stiffer as closer

00:05:52.947 --> 00:05:55.224
as you get to the passenger compartment.

00:05:55.224 --> 00:05:57.458
- One of the biggest
challenges for car safety is

00:05:57.458 --> 00:06:00.146
Newton's First Law that
says whatever is moving

00:06:00.146 --> 00:06:01.738
at a constant speed will tend

00:06:01.738 --> 00:06:03.896
to maintain that constant speed.

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:06.446
So if a car hits something,
the people inside

00:06:06.446 --> 00:06:09.278
maintain their constant speed,
fly through the windshield,

00:06:09.278 --> 00:06:13.375
and suffer a very high deceleration
when they hit the road.

00:06:13.375 --> 00:06:16.140
This is why seatbelts are so important.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.213
They ensure that you stay in the vehicle

00:06:18.213 --> 00:06:19.998
and decelerate with it.

00:06:19.998 --> 00:06:22.147
You know, when seatbelts
were originally introduced,

00:06:22.147 --> 00:06:25.031
they were an option, something
you could pay extra for.

00:06:25.031 --> 00:06:27.300
But once we realized
just how useful they are

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.268
and how they save lives,
well, they became standard

00:06:30.268 --> 00:06:32.297
and now they are mandatory.

00:06:32.297 --> 00:06:34.898
Now, airbags were made
available by Mercedes-Benz

00:06:34.898 --> 00:06:38.806
for the first time in a
serious production car in 1981.

00:06:38.806 --> 00:06:40.878
And again, the idea is similar.

00:06:40.878 --> 00:06:44.277
In a head-on collision, you
want to stop the driver's head

00:06:44.277 --> 00:06:46.633
from accelerating too fast
into the steering wheel,

00:06:46.633 --> 00:06:47.891
and that's what the airbag does.

00:06:47.891 --> 00:06:49.836
It allows that acceleration
to take place over

00:06:49.836 --> 00:06:53.196
a larger distance and
therefore at a lower rate.

00:06:53.196 --> 00:06:56.034
So it helps preserve the driver's head.

00:06:56.034 --> 00:06:59.522
- What you can also see is,
look at this tiny gap here.

00:06:59.522 --> 00:07:01.677
You can barely get your
fingers in between.

00:07:01.677 --> 00:07:04.152
- So that steering column has collapsed.

00:07:04.152 --> 00:07:05.046
- Exactly.

00:07:05.046 --> 00:07:07.441
And it has collapsed in a designed way.

00:07:07.441 --> 00:07:11.786
So after you reach a
certain force threshold,

00:07:11.786 --> 00:07:14.749
then the driver basically pushes away

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:17.547
the entire steering column,
including the airbag,

00:07:17.547 --> 00:07:18.889
by taking away energy.

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:22.424
And what you want to do as an
engineer for restraint systems

00:07:22.424 --> 00:07:26.941
is that you want to basically
connect the driver, passenger,

00:07:26.941 --> 00:07:31.130
and the occupants as tightly
as possible to the car

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.490
in a way that you have the
most time to decelerate.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.477
- Seatbelts, crumple zones, and airbags

00:07:37.477 --> 00:07:39.418
are all passive safety features.

00:07:39.418 --> 00:07:41.246
They're passive in that
they assume a collision

00:07:41.246 --> 00:07:42.389
is occurring and they're just trying

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:45.232
to reduce the acceleration
on the passengers inside.

00:07:45.232 --> 00:07:47.471
But there are also active safety systems,

00:07:47.471 --> 00:07:50.275
like the anti-lock braking system, or ABS,

00:07:50.275 --> 00:07:53.403
which was introduced by Mercedes in 1978.

00:07:53.403 --> 00:07:56.038
The idea with ABS is to
give you more control

00:07:56.038 --> 00:07:59.334
so you may be able to swerve
the car and avoid an accident.

00:07:59.334 --> 00:08:02.708
The way ABS works is by
allowing the wheels to rotate

00:08:02.708 --> 00:08:04.297
rather than locking them up,

00:08:04.297 --> 00:08:06.527
and having the wheels
slide across the ground

00:08:06.527 --> 00:08:08.951
as might happen with
traditional braking systems.

00:08:08.951 --> 00:08:12.240
So, with ABS the wheel is allowed to turn,

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.533
and then it's braked hard, and
then it turns a little more,

00:08:15.533 --> 00:08:16.674
brakes again.

00:08:16.674 --> 00:08:18.871
And by doing that in quick succession

00:08:18.871 --> 00:08:21.679
you allow the wheel to
stay rolling on the ground

00:08:21.679 --> 00:08:24.527
and maintain static
friction against the road.

00:08:24.527 --> 00:08:26.600
That actually increases
the frictional force

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.674
and increases your ability to decelerate

00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:31.362
and also steer around a collision.

00:08:31.362 --> 00:08:35.510
So ABS was a huge improvement
over past braking systems.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:36.526
All of these innovations

00:08:36.526 --> 00:08:38.966
have dramatically improved road safety.

00:08:38.966 --> 00:08:40.875
But there's always more to be done.

00:08:40.875 --> 00:08:41.893
And I got to take a look at

00:08:41.893 --> 00:08:44.840
Mercedes Benz Intelligent
Drive technology,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.380
which is what they're doing right now

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.228
to improve safety,
performance, and convenience.

00:08:49.228 --> 00:08:51.219
And I actually made a
series of videos about that

00:08:51.219 --> 00:08:53.007
over on Mercedes-Benz Channel.

00:08:53.007 --> 00:08:54.957
You can click here to check them out.

00:08:54.957 --> 00:08:56.662
(car engine hums)

00:08:56.662 --> 00:08:58.653
Okay, we're about to go
into a dangerous turn.

00:08:58.653 --> 00:09:02.003
(brakes squeal) and
experience the Pre-Safe.

00:09:02.003 --> 00:09:02.971
(laughing) - [Driver] Hey, I can't brake.

00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:05.045
- I can see this car coming, oh my god!

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:05.878
(brakes squeal)

00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:07.632
(host laughs) - It tends for
me to brake in this situation.

00:09:07.632 --> 00:09:11.301
- I have been in more potentially
crash situations today

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:13.689
than I have been in for my
whole life. (driver laughs)
