00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:06.380
Watch what happens when I place some small drops of food coloring on to this slide.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.080
Some are attracted to each other and merge,

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.860
while others repel and chase each other.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.680
It looks just like the tiny world of micro-organisms, but why?

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.640
Well if you want to try this out for yourself

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.060
You need to get some ordinary food coloring and dilute it with distilled water using a pipette.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.120
Then pass the microscope slide through a flame for about thirty seconds.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.920
Let it cool, and then put some drops of different concentration on to the slide.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.640
You'll find that drops of similar concentration attract each other and merge

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.540
while drops of different concentrations chase each other.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.220
You can draw guides on the slide using permanent marker, which is hydrophobic

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.320
and set up long distance pursuits.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.880
Or you can find that drops of similar concentration attract each other

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.580
despite the hydrophobic barriers.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.800
But how is this possible just using ordinary food coloring and water?

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.940
Well the key is evaporation.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.640
Each drop is constantly evaporating, so around it is an envelope of vapour.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.160
The rate of evaporation depends on the humidity around the drop

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.560
so the drier the air is, the faster the rate of evaporation.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.600
So when any two drops are close enough

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.140
the humidity between them is greater than than the humidity around them,

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.360
and therefore there's more evaporation around the droplets

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.340
then in-between them,

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.200
and this pushes them together.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.520
So differential evaporation makes the droplets attract,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.980
but that's not the whole story.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.580
Food coloring is a mixture of mainly two molecules,

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.720
water and propylene glycol.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.520
These two liquids mix well so we say they are miscible,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.740
but they have different properties.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.120
For example, water evaporates more readily because its lighter,

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.780
and it has a stronger surface tension due to hydrogen bonding.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.140
And this is important because interesting things happen when there are gradients in surface tension.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.880
For example, if I add some pepper to this bowl of water to allow me to see the motion,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.340
and then I add a little dab of soap, right in the middle,

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.800
you see that all of the water rushes outwards,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.760
and this is because soap has a lower surface tension than water.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.200
You can think of it a bit like a tug of war.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.720
Before I added the soap all of those water molecules were pulling on each other equally,

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.960
but once I add the soap molecules in the middle,

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.180
their weaker surface tension means the water molecules around them are pulling

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.220
harder on each other than the soap is,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.800
and so they rush outwards away from that spreading soap drop.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.780
And this motion is called "Marangoni flow."

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.580
And a similar thing is actually happening with our food coloring droplets.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.960
If you have drops of similar concentration they attract each other due to the higher humidity in-between them,

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.960
and they merge.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.380
And although drops of different concentration also attract each other

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.600
they don't merge when they come into contact.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.960
This is because the water in the lower concentration drop

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.340
pulls together and away from the drop with the higher concentration of propylene glycol,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.520
just like with the soap and water.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.420
And differential evaporation drives the two drops forwards.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.700
It is fascinating to watch these droplets and think about how closely their motion mimics life.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.420
Living organisms seek out molecules like food,

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.040
and this is a process known as "chemotaxis."

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.400
But what these droplets are doing is really not all that dissimilar,

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.200
in fact its been called artificial chemotaxis.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.400
And as amazingly life like as their motion appears,

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.840
in a way, I think it shouldn't be all that surprising.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.700
After all, evolution began with the natural tendencies of molecules:

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.480
to form and break apart, to attract and repel.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.420
And then over billions of years of refinement through natural selection,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.440
evolution has produced bodies whose utilisation of

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.680
these natural tendencies of molecules appears miraculous.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.660
And its that,  that we call life.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.980
I tried using slides that hadn't been passed through a flame

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.960
and then I couldn't get the drops to move.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.040
So on researching this further I found out that passing

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.960
the microscope slide through the flame creates a high energy sufrace

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.220
and what that means is, the flame is essentially breaking open some of the bonds -

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.020
the glass bonds in the surface of this slide -

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.960
and when you put the droplet on top,

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.520
Its those open bonds, its that high energy surface that

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.400
draws some of the water molecules away from the droplet.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.940
And that actually makes the water molecule more likely to evaporate.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.980
But as just happened right there, some of the microscopes,

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.100
some of the microscope slides have shattered.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.620
And so you should be particularly careful when doing this procedure,

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.520
obviously heating them up to a very high temperature causes them to expand a lot

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.420
and when they contract again as they're cooling, well then,

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.360
they sometimes break apart because of those stresses.
