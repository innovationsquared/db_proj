00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.160
- In 1901,
this ancient Greek artifact

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.760
was discovered in a shipwreck
of the island of Antikythera.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.700
3D x-ray scans have revealed

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.290
it contains 37 interlocking bronze gears,

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.710
allowing it to model the
motions of the sun and moon,

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.950
and predict eclipses decades in advance.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.170
Constructed around 100 or 200 BC,

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.680
the Antikythera mechanism

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.710
represents a sophisticated early computer.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.270
The likes of which would not be seen again

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.220
for at least a thousand years.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.053
Now, of course,

00:00:32.053 --> 00:00:35.090
this computer didn't work
like modern digital computers.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.440
It works by analogy.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.430
The gears were constructed in such a way

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.640
that the motions of certain dials

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.210
are analogous to the
motion of the sun and moon.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.873
It is an analog computer.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.700
- Here is a simple analog computer

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.690
for adding two numbers together.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.000
If you turn the black wheel some amount

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.160
and then turn this white
wheel a different amount,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.713
the gray wheel shows the
sum of the two rotations.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.930
In contrast, this is a
digital mechanical computer

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.050
where you can add two single bit numbers.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.080
So zero plus zero equals zero.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.710
Zero plus one equals one.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.180
And one plus one equals two.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.690
These two devices
illustrate the differences

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.570
between analog and digital computers.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.120
Analog computers have a continuous range

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.930
of inputs and outputs,

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.650
whereas digital only works
with discrete values.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.020
With analog computers,
the quantities of interest

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.310
are actually represented
by something physical,

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.060
like the amount a wheel has turned.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.670
Whereas digital computers work on symbols

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.760
like zeros and ones.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.700
If the answer is, say, two,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.280
there is nothing in the computer

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.150
that is 'twice as much' as a one.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.880
In analog computers, there is.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.230
For thousands of years,

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.210
people used analog devices

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.350
like the Antikythera
mechanism or slide rules,

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.280
alongside digital devices like abacuses.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.000
And up until the 1960s,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.440
the most powerful computers on the planet

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.470
were actually analog.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.640
Digital computers exploded onto the scene

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.300
with the advent of
solid-state transistors.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.030
And now, almost everything is digital.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.820
Most people have never even
heard of analog computers.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.800
But today, that may all be changing.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.633
Moore's Law,

00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:26.780
the idea that you can double
the number of transistors

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.570
on a chip every two years,

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.010
it's reaching its limit,

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.450
because transistors are
nearly the same size as atoms.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.210
Simultaneously, advancements
in machine learning

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.790
are straining the capabilities
of digital computers.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.570
The solution to these challenges

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.153
may well be a new generation
of analog computers.

00:02:46.153 --> 00:02:48.180
(soft upbeat music)

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.290
- One of the
most important problems

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.330
humans have faced for millennia
is predicting the tides.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.320
Napoleon and his men nearly
died crossing the Red Sea

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.680
due to a miscalculation
of the rising tide.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.580
And sailors routinely
needed to know the tides

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.930
to bring their ships into
port without running aground.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.910
Most coastal locations on earth

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.670
experience two high and
two low tides per day,

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.670
but their exact timing varies
as does their magnitude.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.810
And this is partly caused by local factors

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.370
like the depth of the sea bed

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.083
and the shape of the shoreline.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.240
In the late 1700s, to describe
the tidal flow of the oceans,

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.530
Pierre-Simon Laplace

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.720
derived a set of complicated
differential equations.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.130
They had no analytical solution,

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.120
so at that time they
were basically useless.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.720
But in the process of
deriving his equations,

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.050
Laplace made a key finding.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.230
Tides are driven

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.660
at only a few specific
astronomical frequencies,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.700
including the moon, the sun,

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.970
and the eccentricity of the lunar orbit.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.990
Each one of these factors
contributes a sine wave

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.830
of a particular amplitude and
phase to the total tide curve.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:02.900
If someone could figure out

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.513
how to correctly combine
these frequency components,

00:04:05.513 --> 00:04:08.393
well the tides could finally be predicted.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.530
It took nearly a century.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.240
But in the 1860s,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.420
William Thompson, later Lord
Kelvin, took up the challenge.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.160
Having completed several voyages

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.950
to lay the first
transatlantic telegraph cable,

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.520
he developed a fascination with the sea.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.530
And subsequently, he threw
his full scientific effort

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.880
into measuring and predicting the tides.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.050
Tide gauges at that time used a buoy

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.470
to record the height of
the sea onto a paper roll.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.010
Kelvin set out to
determine how sine waves,

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.410
with the frequencies
identified by Laplace,

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.370
could add together to produce
the observed tidal curve.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.500
The key was to apply the
work of French mathematician,

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.970
Joseph Fourier, who had shown
how to decompose any function

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.410
into a sum of sine waves.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.070
Most English scientists
were skeptical of the work,

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.520
but Thompson was enthralled by it.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.520
His first paper, published at
17, was a defense of Fourier.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.080
While it was straightforward

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.660
to apply Fourier's
analysis to tidal curves,

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.150
the computation required was enormous.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.290
First, divide the tide curve
up into short time intervals.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.490
And for each interval,

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.200
multiply the tide level by a sine wave

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.410
with the frequency of interest.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.580
Add up the area of all these rectangles,

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.620
and divide by the total time.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.080
And this gives you a single coefficient,

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.700
the amplitude of the sine
wave with this frequency.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.590
Then you have to repeat the
process for a cosine function

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.193
with the same frequency.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.820
Kelvin found that to make
accurate predictions,

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.070
he actually needed 10
different frequency components.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.050
So that is a lot of
multiplication and addition

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.560
to characterize the tides
at just one location.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.380
For each additional location,

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.240
you have to perform this
analysis all over again.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.860
And this is only half the problem.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.010
Once you have the amplitudes and phases

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.280
of the sine functions,

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.790
you have to add them up to
predict the future tides.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.550
- Lord Kelvin spent years

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.510
analyzing and predicting tides by hand.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.110
Then he had a stroke of inspiration.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.360
Could you design a machine

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.920
to carry out these
calculations automatically?

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.610
In Kelvin's words to
"substitute brass for brains,"

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.350
the resulting analog computers

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.970
were in use for nearly a century.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.460
They even played a critical role

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.310
in the outcome of World War II.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.510
- Kelvin started
with the problem of prediction,

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.090
adding the sine waves together,

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.230
given you know their
amplitudes and phases.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.570
He knew he could create sinusoidal motion

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.970
with a device called a scotch yoke.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.120
It extracts one dimension
from uniform circular motion.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.610
But to make a tide prediction,

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.910
he needed a way to combine
10 sine waves together.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.770
He needed a mechanical
analog for addition.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.380
Stuck on this problem in
1872, Kelvin boarded a train

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.940
for a meeting with the main
sponsor of his tidal research,

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.980
the British Association.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.320
On the train, Kelvin bumped into a friend,

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.750
inventor Beauchamp Tower, to
whom he explained his dilemma.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.140
Towers suggested he used Wheatstone's plan

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.900
of a chain passing around
a number of pulleys.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.400
And this was exactly
the addition mechanism

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.170
Kelvin was looking for.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.700
By attaching a pulley to each scotch yoke

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.810
and running a weighted cord around them,

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.910
he could mechanically add
all of their contributions

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.100
at once.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.700
He scribbled down the entire plan

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.660
for this predictor machine
by the end of the train ride.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.730
He pitched it to the British Association,

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.453
and secured funding to build
it all before he returned home.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.920
If you knew the relative contributions

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.780
of different frequency components,

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.450
Kelvin now had a machine to
automate the tedious task

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.780
of predicting future tides.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.570
This was a great leap forward.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.710
Four hours of cranking the handle

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:58.020
yielded a full year of tidal predictions.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.060
But for many years,

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.420
the harder half of the problem
was still done by hand,

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.470
breaking apart an existing tide curve

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.780
into its component frequencies.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.260
To automate this step,
Kelvin needed a machine

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.940
capable of multiplying the
tide curve times the sine wave,

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.520
and then taking its integral.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.770
What would such a device even look like?

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.860
With his older brother, James Thompson,

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.650
Kelvin came up with a
mechanical integrator.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.080
It consists of a ball on a rotating disk.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.970
Due to the rotation of the disk,

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.120
the further the ball is from the center,

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.200
the faster it spins.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.650
If the ball is at the
very center of the disk,

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.410
it doesn't turn at all.

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:38.780
And if it's on the left side,

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.730
it turns in the opposite direction.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.530
Now the motion of the ball
is converted into an output

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:45.820
via a roller,

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.653
which moves a pen up or down
on the output graph paper.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.170
So the way it works

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.270
is you trace the function
you want to integrate

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:55.430
with a stylus,

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.870
and the stylus controls the
position of the ball on the disk

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.520
and hence its speed of rotation.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.500
This is transferred through
the roller to the output,

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.453
which plots the integral
of the original function.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.640
Now to decompose a tide curve,

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.770
we don't just wanna
integrate the function.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:14.230
We first wanna multiply it

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:17.087
by a sine wave of a particular frequency.

00:09:17.087 --> 00:09:18.530
And the way to do this

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:21.460
is to make the disk rotate back and forth

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.223
at that specific frequency.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.500
Now the rotation of the ball

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.230
depends not only on
where it is on the disk,

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.010
but also on how the disc
is turning at an instant.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.330
You trace the tide curve with the stylus,

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.820
which moves the ball back and
forth on the oscillating disk,

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.040
and the roller sums up the
integral of the tide curve

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.030
times the sine wave.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:46.950
Simply divide by the total
time to get the coefficient.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.930
Several of these ball and disk integrators

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:50.730
can be connected in parallel

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:54.220
with each disk oscillating
at a different frequency

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.610
to calculate the coefficients

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:59.123
for multiple frequency
components at the same time.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.440
Kelvin's analog computers

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.520
revolutionized our
ability to predict tides.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.610
Tidal curves from anywhere in the world

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:10.630
could be turned into a set
of sinusoidal coefficients

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.680
using the ball and disk harmonic analyzer.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.150
And the resulting sinusoids
could be added together

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:17.710
to predict the future tides

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:20.393
using his scotch yoke pulley machine.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.350
- [Derek] Kelvin's harmonic analyzers

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.760
were the basis for a
landmark analog computer

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.780
called the differential analyzer,

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.650
and his tide predicting machines

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:32.400
were used well into the 1960s.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.240
In fact, they were later overhauled

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.840
to include 26 frequency components

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.383
and used to plan the
allied invasion on D-Day.

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.440
- The Germans
expected any invasion

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.700
to come at high tide to minimize the time

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.560
Allied soldiers would be
exposed on the beaches.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.000
So they installed millions of obstacles

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.260
that would be underwater by mid tide,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.270
many with explosive mines attached.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.760
But the allies spotted the
obstacles and change tack.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.190
Instead, they plan to begin
the invasion at low tide.

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:04.840
This would allow demolition teams

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.700
to first clear channels
through the obstacles,

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.130
then the main forces could
come through those gaps

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:11.730
as the water rose.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.670
This would also give
landing craft enough time

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.940
to depart without getting beached.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.900
The low water times were different

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.710
at the five landing
beaches by over an hour,

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.940
so the invasion times were staggered

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.033
according to the tide predictions.

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.270
- This wasn't the only
use of analog computers

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:30.560
in World War II.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.300
Dive bomber aircraft would
plummet out of the sky

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:37.000
directly toward their targets
at up to an 80 degree angle,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.480
and their rapid descents

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.010
made them very difficult to shoot down.

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:43.210
So the U.S. began searching for devices

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.770
to automatically aim guns at dive bombers.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.250
Most of the proposed solutions

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.540
fell into one of two categories.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.540
Some were analog machines
like Lord Kelvin's.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.370
Others were essentially fast calculators.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.680
Mechanical calculating
machines like the abacus

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.150
had been around for millennia,

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.540
but they were far too slow
to respond to dive bombers.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.930
These new calculating
machines sped things up

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.240
by using electrical pulses.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.340
The committee considered
naming these devices

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.200
after the pulses they used.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.570
But member George Stibitz

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.910
proposed a more general name: digital,

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:20.070
because these machines
operated on numbers themselves

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.790
or digits.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.890
And this is the origin of
the term digital computer.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.840
But digital would have to wait.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.360
Of all the proposals and
innovative analog machine

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.231
from David Parkinson won out.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.280
At Bell Labs in New York,

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.150
Parkinson had been working on a device

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:41.270
to chart telephone data called
an automatic level recorder.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:44.020
It used a variable resistor
called a potentiometer

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.660
to control the motion of a pen.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.400
One night, after hearing reports

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.090
of the harrowing allied
evacuation of Dunkirk,

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:54.170
Parkinson had a dream that
he was on the front lines.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:55.253
(radio tatters)

00:12:55.253 --> 00:12:57.467
(mystical music)
(gun firing)

00:12:57.467 --> 00:13:01.637
"I found myself in a gun pit
with an anti-aircraft gun crew.

00:13:01.637 --> 00:13:03.597
"A gun there was firing occasionally,

00:13:03.597 --> 00:13:06.467
"and the impressive
thing was that every shot

00:13:06.467 --> 00:13:08.387
"brought down an airplane.

00:13:08.387 --> 00:13:09.727
"After three or four shots,

00:13:09.727 --> 00:13:11.467
"one of the men in the crew smiled at me

00:13:11.467 --> 00:13:13.907
"and beckoned me to
come closer to the gun.

00:13:13.907 --> 00:13:14.777
"When I drew near,

00:13:14.777 --> 00:13:18.017
"he pointed to the exposed
end of the left trunnion.

00:13:18.017 --> 00:13:21.147
"Mounted there was the
control potentiometer

00:13:21.147 --> 00:13:23.350
"of my level recorder."

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.570
When he woke up, Parkinson realized

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.920
the device he was
building to control a pen

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.810
could be scaled up to
control an anti-aircraft gun.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.800
He shared this idea with his supervisor,

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.240
and after receiving
approval from the military,

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.080
they set out to make
Parkinson's dream a reality.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.440
Researchers at Bell Labs

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.250
had recently invented an
analog electrical device

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:47.240
called an operational amplifier or op-amp.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.140
It could perform mathematical
operations with voltages,

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.300
like addition and multiplication.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.340
They used these op-amps to
create an analog computer

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.130
that could solve the ballistics equations

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.090
for anti-aircraft guns.

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:01.940
Using radar and optical
sites to obtain the speed,

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.400
altitude and direction of enemy planes,

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.900
the M9 Gun Director, as
the computer was called,

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.490
could rapidly calculate
the correct trajectory

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.000
and few setting.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.670
Potentiometers were used
to ascertain the direction

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.650
the gun was pointing.

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:19.710
This was not the first
electric analog computer,

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:21.880
but it was an important one.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.780
In World War I, It took an
average of 17,000 rounds

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.850
to take down a single airplane.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:30.590
In 1943, after the invention of the M9,

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:33.350
it took an average of only 90.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:37.610
During the war, the U.S.
invested big in analog computers.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.710
If you break down their
total military budget,

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:41.980
the third largest single expense

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.700
was the development and production

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:47.070
of an incredibly complex
mechanical analog computer

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.260
called the Norden bombsight.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.143
Unfortunately, they didn't
get their money's worth.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.640
- Designed by
the eccentric Dutch engineer,

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.290
Carl Norden, the Norden
bombsight was built

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:01.000
to enable high precision airborne bombing.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.860
It implemented 64 different
simultaneous algorithms,

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.540
including one that compensated

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.328
for the rotation of the
earth as the bomb fell.

00:15:09.328 --> 00:15:10.550
(bomb exploding)

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.320
The Norden was one of the
most closely guarded secrets

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.500
of the war.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.600
To prevent the technology
from falling into enemy hands,

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.260
American bombardiers carried handguns

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.663
specifically to destroy it
in the event of a crash.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.690
But despite its hype and funding,

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:29.320
the Norden didn't work as advertised.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.690
With over 2,000 fine parts,

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:35.210
it required extreme
precision to manufacture.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.290
The problem with analog computers

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:40.580
is that the physical device
is a model for the real world.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.010
So any inaccuracy in the components

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:46.630
translates into inaccuracy
of the computation.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.660
And since there will always be some slop

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.580
in the connections between parts,

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.870
if you run the same calculation twice,

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:55.890
you won't get the exact same answer.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:58.470
In the American campaign against Japan,

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.160
bomber crews using the bombsite

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.080
were unable to destroy critical
Japanese war infrastructure.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.000
And ultimately,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.070
the U.S. abandoned its
precision bombing approach,

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:11.753
and instead blanketed whole
Japanese cities in napalm.

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:17.480
As the war progressed, digital
computers gained traction.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.180
The digital and electronic
Colossus machines

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:21.950
of Bletchley Park in the UK

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.690
were critical to breaking German codes.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:25.710
In the United States,

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:28.230
the military invested
in an enormously complex

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:31.450
and expensive digital
machine, known as ENIAC.

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:32.380
It was designed

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.310
to speed up the calculation of
land artillery firing tables.

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:37.143
At the time,

00:16:37.143 --> 00:16:39.540
these were computed using
differential analyzers,

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.660
the analog mechanical computers

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.570
based on Kelvin's harmonic analyzer.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:47.020
Although not finished until after the war,

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.560
ENIAC demonstrated the
power of digital computers.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:54.053
It's considered by many to
be the first modern computer.

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.370
- What really opened the door

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:57.680
to this digital revolution

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.610
was the discovery made by Claude Shannon

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:02.210
in his 1936 master's thesis.

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:05.450
He showed that any numerical
operation can be carried out

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:08.630
using the basic building
blocks of Boolean algebra:

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:12.610
Two values, true or false,
also notated as one or zero,

00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:16.850
and three operations and, or, and not.

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:18.460
This makes digital computers

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.460
the ideal versatile computing machines.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.570
In contrast, each analog computer

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:27.140
is an analog for only one type of problem.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.770
Furthermore, since digital computers

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.510
operate on ones and zeros,

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:33.250
they are more resilient
in the face of noise.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.410
It would take a large error
to mistake a one for a zero

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:37.760
or vice versa.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:41.440
Whereas, even small errors
in analog computers can grow

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.070
and ultimately swamp the signal.

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.870
So these days, everything is digital.

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:50.100
Our phones, computers,
and internet data centers,

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.720
even TV and radio is now
being broadcast as digital.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.720
The advantages are obvious.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.120
Since digital devices operate on symbols,

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.920
usually zeros and ones,
they provide exact answers.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.470
And repeat the calculation,
and you get the same result.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.880
They are robust to noise.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.270
Plus, since only a few
components are required

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.550
to perform virtually any computation,

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.000
those components have been
miniaturized and optimized,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.260
making digital computers

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.660
the ideal universal computing machines.

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:24.200
So you would think analog
computers would be long gone,

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.380
a relic of the distant past.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.800
But, analog may now be making a comeback.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:34.340
There are startups actively
working on analog computers.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.560
Why is this happening?

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.430
What could be the benefit of analog?

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.700
I wanted to put all of
these into one video.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.720
But the story is too good
to bury 20 minutes in,

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.720
so that is coming up in part two.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.050
Be sure you're subscribed to the channel

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.237
to be notified when that comes out.

00:18:51.237 --> 00:18:54.237
(soft upbeat music)

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.820
I'll give you a hint about the sequel

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.230
in this section of the video,

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.340
which is sponsored by Brilliant.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.320
Brilliant is a website and
app that uses interactivity

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.640
to help you learn STEM concepts.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.180
For the sequel to this video,

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.440
it would be a good idea

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.880
to brush up on artificial intelligence,

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.040
which you can do with Brilliant's courses

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.500
on neural networks.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.490
Here you can analyze

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:19.770
how a neural network
decodes your handwriting.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.530
I also recommend their calculus courses,

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:23.750
which are highly interactive.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.030
What's great about Brilliant

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.980
is how it gets you to step through topics,

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.530
answering questions as you go.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:30.280
In that way, you can't trick yourself

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.310
into thinking you already
understand everything,

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.430
because you're constantly
putting your knowledge

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:35.470
to the test.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:37.760
Personally, I find their
courses challenging,

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.250
which they should be in order
for you to learn anything.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:42.420
But if you ever get stuck,

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.170
there's always a helpful
hint close at hand,

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:47.310
and more in-depth
explanations are available

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:48.760
if you want them.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.420
