00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.384
This propeller craft was built to
settle a physics debate

00:00:03.384 --> 00:00:08.356
because what its creators claim it can do is so
counterintuitive

00:00:08.356 --> 00:00:12.630
that it seems to violate the law of conservation of energy.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.910
So I've come here to drive it
myself and see if it really works.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.859
And is it safe? It feels makeshift.
I'm not gonna lie.

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:22.200
I need some wind.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.282
Give me a gust. It's a
little unbalanced. Isn't it?

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.132
Slow it down, Derek!

00:00:32.827 --> 00:00:34.307
Pull tack, pull tack!

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.310
This video was sponsored by Kiwico,
more about them at the end of the show.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.150
I've come to El Mirage, a dry lakebed,

00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:51.650
a couple hours from Los Angeles to
race a one of a kind propeller craft.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.343
It's called Blackbird.

00:00:56.343 --> 00:00:57.978
And I'm here with its inventor, Rick

00:00:57.978 --> 00:00:59.009
- Howdy!

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.274
And the current owner, Neil.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.190
It all started with a brain teaser:

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.020
Can any wind-powered
vehicle go directly downwind

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.043
faster than the wind itself?

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.920
If you've got a sail boat and you're
sailing it straight down, wind. - Yeah.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.280
As soon as that sailboat is
going the same speed as the wind,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.220
then there is no more wind. That is
correct. You can't push the sailboat.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.400
So sailboats can't just go
downwind faster than the wind.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.266
Not straight downwind.

00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:28.530
-Not straight downwind? Not direct downwind.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.420
Imagine a boat floating in the water.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.547
As the wind picks up, it pushes
the sail, accelerating the boat.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.340
The boat gets faster and
faster until its speed

00:01:40.341 --> 00:01:43.880
exactly matches the
wind. But at this point,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.550
the wind can't push the
sail anymore. I mean,

00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:48.830
if you imagine it from the
frame of reference of the boat,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.410
there's no longer any apparent wind.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.550
There's no air moving over the boat
because the air and the boat are moving

00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:57.680
together at the same speed.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.600
So a sailboat going directly
downwind can only match the speed

00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:06.650
of the wind, never exceed
it, even if there's no drag.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.340
But the claim is Blackbird can do it.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.063
It can go straight downwind faster
than the air that is pushing it.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.270
Well the weather forecast is
still holding. Okay, good.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.850
We can feel it's at like one now. Yeah.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.900
But El Mirage has a reputation of like
when it fills in... Yeah, it happens.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.340
It happens. I think we start somewhere
in the middle. All right. Well, let's,

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.243
let's move over.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.900
We're moving to a spot
that will give us a long,

00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:39.110
straight path downwind with no obstacles.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.340
All we need now is for the wind to
pick up and maintain its direction.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.880
But we've been out here in the
hot desert for hours and there is

00:02:49.881 --> 00:02:51.320
still no wind.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.400
This is Gene. He runs
the YouTube channel Potato Jet.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.700
All the awesome drone shots
in this video are his.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.240
So if you like cameras and
gear and amazing drone shots,

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.006
go check out his channel.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.980
This is, this is about a
typical day. How it goes.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.330
Derek, I think the wind is
just chosen its direction.

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:21.360
I want to move us to the
other side. We'll set up.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.780
We'll point downwind over in
this direction. We'll put you in.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.530
Let's make it happen!
Yes. I want to do it!

00:03:33.114 --> 00:03:36.987
Your feet need to go a long way
down. So it'll feel really recumbant.

00:03:36.987 --> 00:03:40.740
So maybe I need to... Keep going.
Should I get something behind me? Yup!

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.080
I'm very reclined. Yeah.
Let me see what I can find.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.110
It's slightly terrifying to, uh,

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.193
not be able to push the brake all the way.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.200
So you're kind of right
at the limit of size.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.177
Yeah. You wouldn't want to be any
smaller.

00:03:55.177 --> 00:03:58.855
Uh, so steering is I... - Push to go left,

00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:01.860
-Push to go left. -Pull to go right. -Pull to go right.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.750
While steering with my right hand,

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.330
I have to control the pitch
of the propeller blades.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.838
With my left hand.

00:04:07.838 --> 00:04:09.480
And then in terms of like,

00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:12.180
when I'm getting to the end or something
where I really want to slow down,

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.406
the right move is pull back?

00:04:15.406 --> 00:04:17.525
You're saying the right move is push forward?

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.900
I'm glad that the two experts here
are disagreeing on what to do in the

00:04:21.901 --> 00:04:24.060
emergency case of like, I
just want to stop the vehicle.

00:04:25.148 --> 00:04:27.464
- Feel which is slowing you down
and do that.

00:04:27.464 --> 00:04:28.849
[nervous laughter]

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.921
It's just terrifying not to have
a, a blanket rule.

00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:34.534
Well, uh, this is intense.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.750
I have never tried to go faster than
the wind downwind in a vehicle where I'm

00:04:39.751 --> 00:04:43.170
just supported by this
mesh hammock under my butt.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.350
It feels like being in a rolling coffin.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.630
It's just been uh shoddily put
together, but I'm excited to try it.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.370
And I'm excited to survive.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.790
You can look at that
orange string right there.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.930
It's showing that the wind is picking
up behind me. This is what I need.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.690
On the front of Blackbird, there's a,
telltale, a little piece of string,

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.827
which shows which way the wind is
blowing.

00:05:11.827 --> 00:05:13.740
To drive straight downwind.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.630
I just need to follow the telltale.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.337
So it should be pointing
straight out in front.

00:05:18.894 --> 00:05:20.670
Now, if I get up to wind speed,

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.380
the telltale should drop straight down
because effectively I'll be in still

00:05:25.381 --> 00:05:28.860
air. I'll be moving exactly
the same speed as the wind.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.744
All right, good luck Derek!
- Thank you.

00:05:35.744 --> 00:05:36.960
I hope I survive this.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.178
Come on, come on.

00:05:42.178 --> 00:05:44.490
I need some wind. Give me a gust.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.730
Now, if I can actually
go faster than the wind,

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.397
the telltale should flip around and point
straight at me, indicating that I have

00:05:52.397 --> 00:05:54.360
an apparent headwind,

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.040
even though the true wind, standing
on the ground, is coming from behind.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.430
We're going straight downwind.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.997
What have I got? Six miles an hour.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.770
The string is just dangling. You
see the string dangling there? Oh,

00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:13.460
I just need a gust right here. I just
need a bit of wind. That's all I need.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.235
I will, uh, hop on the brakes
here.

00:06:17.235 --> 00:06:18.710
Man, we were so close.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.247
I mean, I saw that string
dangling down. I was like, okay,

00:06:24.247 --> 00:06:25.730
this is it. Let's keep going.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.330
And then unfortunately. At one point it was
dangling and I asked, what speed are we?

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.220
And he said, we're five or six
miles an hour. And I'm like damn.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.910
Cause he's almost exactly wind speed.
Yep. Five or six miles an hour.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.860
Just not enough to get you -
right - past there. I needed

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.930
just like that extra few.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.250
Miles an hour. 8's kinda the absolute
minimum, 10 is pretty healthy. Yeah. Yeah.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.300
Well, I can't wait.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.390
Now you might be wondering how it's even
theoretically possible for this vehicle

00:06:49.391 --> 00:06:53.260
to go faster than the wind
will. Well sailboats can do it.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.580
As long as they're traveling at some
angle to the wind. In this case,

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.290
the sail acts like a wing air flows
faster over the outer curved surface than

00:07:02.291 --> 00:07:07.240
the inner side, which generates lift a
force perpendicular to the apparent wind.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.510
A component of this lift force
is in the forward direction.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:15.160
So maximum speed is reached when this
forward force is equal to all the drag

00:07:15.161 --> 00:07:17.230
forces on the boat, pushing it backwards.

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:21.190
Some boats can go three
or four times wind speed.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.330
Somebody had asked the question. If
a sailboat is tacking down, wind,

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.230
can it do a VMG velocity made good
directly downwind? Can it beat - if I,

00:07:29.231 --> 00:07:30.910
if I release a balloon in the air,

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.230
can the sailboat tack its way down and
beat the balloon to its destination?

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.100
And I didn't know the answer.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.730
It turns out that sailing
at some angle to the wind,

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:44.500
a sailboat can go enough faster that
it's resulting velocity directly downwind

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.580
is faster than the wind
itself. In other words,

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.150
it can beat a balloon that
is just drifting on the wind.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.600
I love brainteasers. I just
love doing brainteaser.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.560
So I thought this is really close to a
good brain teaser, but it's right now.

00:07:59.561 --> 00:08:00.580
It's just a question though.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:04.360
If we make it go straight downwind and
then people were definitely going to say

00:08:04.361 --> 00:08:07.930
no. If the earth were a cylinder,

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:12.430
instead of a sphere, I can have a
sailboat on a continuous downwind tack.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.670
The wind is going along the
earth, this cylindrical earth.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.060
And the sailboat is just
spiraling its way down. - Hmm.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.380
If I put two sailboats, one on
either side, they can both do this...

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.620
Well. That's a prop. Effectively

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.990
their sales make a propeller,

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:37.750
a propeller that is traveling down
this earth faster than the wind itself.

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:41.830
It was, I posted on two
forums that I was on. Right.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.940
And I thought people are initially going
to go, no, never work. And then I say,

00:08:45.941 --> 00:08:49.880
okay, here's how it works. And they
go oh, [bleep] you got us. Boy,

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.580
I couldn't have possibly been more wrong.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:56.940
This is, obviously, stupid.
Wind isn't some kind of magic.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.610
We all want to believe
in perpetual motion,

00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:03.570
but I just don't see the logic
of this argument as yet. Okay.

00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:07.770
This is clearly fake. Anyone with
a clue should see the problem here.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.010
Once you reach wind speed,
what powers it past that?

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:15.270
I am not a stupid person,
but I cannot understand.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:17.750
Ultimately we said, okay,

00:09:17.751 --> 00:09:21.980
if we build a little model of one and put
it on a treadmill that just puts it to

00:09:21.981 --> 00:09:22.814
bed. Right.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.470
And it worked really well. Now you,
you're holding it back with this spork?

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:28.014
otherwise it'll climb right
up the top of the treadmill.

00:09:28.014 --> 00:09:33.440
Yeah I'm keeping it from coming forward,

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.250
But people on the internet just wouldn't
believe him. They thought it was fake.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:41.780
And even physics professors were arguing
that the treadmill wasn't a good analog

00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:46.430
of the real world. And I'm like literally
day one, physics is inertial frames,

00:09:46.431 --> 00:09:48.740
right? It doesn't matter if you're
moving or the air is moving.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.140
The others were saying there's
magnets, there's wires.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.050
And you go there's fans out of view.
So then we do one showing, you know,

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:57.320
- no fans - the curtains aren't
moving and stuff. And finally he says,

00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.090
we got to build the real thing.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.290
Okay. We are cooking.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.600
I see we're going seven, seven
miles an hour, eight miles an hour.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:22.160
Come on. You got it. Come on. Uh oh.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:28.010
I'm very sad about this propeller.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:32.660
So I'm guessing this means the
chain has come off. How did it feel?

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.890
It was a lot of fun. I could feel us
picking up speed. I could see it spinning.

00:10:36.891 --> 00:10:40.010
I could see that we got up to like
eight miles an hour, nine miles an hour.

00:10:40.011 --> 00:10:41.990
And I was like, oh, we're
just going to do it. You know?

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.410
And then all of a sudden I
still felt like I was going,

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:48.020
but I noticed that the prop wasn't
spinning, and I thought, oh,

00:10:48.021 --> 00:10:52.820
that's a terrible sign. So, uh, yeah.
Then we had to stop and fix the,

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:53.893
fix the chain.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.750
When in doubt use a bigger wrench.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.640
So here's the thing about this
vehicle. It's not what it looks like.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:07.400
What you imagine. I bet is that when
the wind blows on that propeller,

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:11.210
it spins the way the wind is pushing
it. And that drives the wheels.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.850
But that's actually not how this works.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.390
The way it works is the
wind pushes it from behind.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.030
And just because it's a bluff body,

00:11:20.031 --> 00:11:22.220
it's just an object
sitting out in the desert.

00:11:22.221 --> 00:11:24.140
It starts to roll forwards a little bit.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:30.200
Now that causes the wheels to turn
and they're geared to the propeller

00:11:30.201 --> 00:11:34.640
in such a way that they turn it opposite
the direction the wind is pushing it.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:38.300
So rather than this propeller
operating like a windmill,

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.170
it spins like a fan pushing air backwards.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.690
And that's what drives the craft forwards.

00:11:49.071 --> 00:11:51.320
So like one of those crazy things
you never think you're going to do,

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.500
be out in a dry bed with some crazy
propeller vehicle that some physics

00:11:56.501 --> 00:11:59.560
professors believe break the laws
of science. Yeah. That's cool.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:10.740
Derek, ready to rock.? If you
think so, I'm ready. All right.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.720
We're hoping we can
catch one of these puffs.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.820
The wind is strong and
the prop is turning,

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:25.050
but something is definitely wrong.
Just look at that propelorl.

00:12:25.051 --> 00:12:26.460
It' a little unbalanced, isn't
it? Pull the pitch! Good.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.860
So what's the game plan?

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:39.780
If you feel excessive vibration. I think
we got to pull the trigger on it. Yeah.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:45.270
And I want to go right out and say: I
don't think I would drive it in this

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.020
wind. I will, if you would
like me to. I mean, I will,

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.840
I will given the opportunity,
but I'm more than hap...

00:12:53.841 --> 00:12:57.060
I didn't come here to drive. So
you drive it. If you want to do it.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.270
If you were going to decide
about getting in like it there a.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.150
Is there a point where you
say that's too much? Um,

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.880
for today and the way
things are? 15 ish. Okay.

00:13:08.881 --> 00:13:13.230
So 15ish is what we were measuring like
earlier. What are you seeing now? Ehh...

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:14.550
That feels like.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:15.570
15 To me. Yeah.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:20.670
I've been out there for several hours
and first it was just waiting to go.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.960
And now it's like, it's broken
and now I was like, we can go,

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:29.790
but it might shake itself apart.
And the wind is on the high end.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.350
This is sketchy for sure.

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:40.063
Oh God. Did

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:47.340
We get that on camera?
Did you? I did, Oh no!

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.081
Uh,

00:13:55.081 --> 00:13:59.250
what's happening is they're getting
pretty uncomfortable with what they saw in

00:13:59.251 --> 00:14:01.440
terms of the shake, the wobble.

00:14:01.441 --> 00:14:06.300
And they're worried that it's gonna
like break in half the whole structural

00:14:06.301 --> 00:14:09.030
component and the whole propeller is
going to come down on whoever's driving.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.080
So they're a little bit, um,
reticent to let me keep driving.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.380
So the guy who basically built it,

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.650
he's going to risk himself
in the driver's seat.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.570
And then if it's not shaking itself apart,
then maybe I get another shot after.

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.600
So that's a, that's the word

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:30.170
right

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:36.170
now.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.910
In Rick's run, it didn't
seem to shake very much.

00:14:38.911 --> 00:14:41.370
So they think it's safe
for me to jump in. You

00:14:46.321 --> 00:14:48.030
don't think this wind is much more than.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:49.650
I do. I really do.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.110
But it means that you will have
nearly a guaranteed success,

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.120
but you just got to manage your limit.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.750
How much faster than the wind do you
think you need to go? Yeah. -You doing it?

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:05.750
Man, It feels like just the
stakes keep getting higher.

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:09.500
Like they didn't want me to run
it before 'cause it was too windy.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.570
But like now it's windier, but they're
comfortable with me piloting it. So

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.950
I don't know what to say.
This is frightening, but
also I came here for this.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.410
I want to do it. Put me in coach.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.900
If this thing doesn't fall
apart, maybe I'll be able.

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:31.970
To go faster than the wind this time.

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:39.440
I'm getting in that vehicle
and I'm headed that way as

00:15:39.441 --> 00:15:40.310
fast as I can.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.410
The sun is setting and we're going for it.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:49.640
This is the last chance for me to
go faster than the wind downwind.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.490
This is the one guys.

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:59.830
Back, a little left so that I can make
a straight shot down at the windsock.

00:15:59.831 --> 00:16:02.740
It looks like we're coming
up on wind speed here.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.640
Blackbird is getting faster and faster.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:10.630
I'm just willing it to
go past the wind speed.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.570
Come on, come on, come on.
Speed up, speed up with me.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:32.410
Come on, yeah. Wooooo!
Yeah.... And there you have it.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:37.480
The telltale is pointing straight back
at me showing an apparent headwind while

00:16:37.481 --> 00:16:41.260
the windsock shows the true wind
is in the opposite direction.

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.290
I'm going faster than the wind.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:49.440
Slow

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:55.440
it
down
Derek.
Pull
tack,
pull
tack!
Oooh,
that
was...

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.520
God damn that got my heart rate up.
Sacred the [beep] out of us Derek. -Did

00:17:18.521 --> 00:17:20.380
that look scary? Cause
it didn't feel too bad.

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.220
So how does it actually work? Well,

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:32.140
I worked on this video for weeks without
really understanding how it works.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:36.010
So I want to share with you
the way that I understand it.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.900
So if this vehicle is moving
at the speed of the wind well,

00:17:40.901 --> 00:17:45.250
then there's no relative
air motion over the cart.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:46.690
So how can it keep accelerating?

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:52.170
If this were like a windmill that required
air to flow over it in order to turn

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.730
well, then it wouldn't accelerate
anymore, but that's not how this operates.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:01.920
This propeller operates as a fan, which
means if you imagine this still air,

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:06.030
the propeller can come down and
hit some of these air molecules,

00:18:06.031 --> 00:18:09.150
pushing them backwards
and therefore get thrust.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:13.260
It's like having a fan on your cart.
So of course even in still air,

00:18:13.261 --> 00:18:15.780
having a fan on the cart
will blow you forwards.

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:20.790
But that brings up this idea of it feels
like we're getting energy from nowhere.

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:24.900
Where's the energy to power the fan coming
from? If it's coming from the wheels,

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:29.730
why doesn't that slow us down more
than the fan manages to blow us back.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:34.650
And the answer to that is that you're
moving at a different speed over the

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:39.060
ground. than you're moving through the
air because you have that tailwind.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:42.330
So the way I like to
imagine it is like this:

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:47.520
there's air everywhere going 10
kilometers per hour down that way.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.970
Now, even if we're going
10 kilometers per hour,

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.030
we can still push air backwards.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:58.350
And so if you were to look at a profile
of the air in a stationary reference

00:18:58.351 --> 00:19:02.910
point, you would see that the wind
behind the propeller would be moving more

00:19:02.911 --> 00:19:05.850
slowly downwind than all the other wind.

00:19:05.851 --> 00:19:10.530
That's because this propeller has
taken some of the energy out of that

00:19:10.531 --> 00:19:14.280
wind and converted it into the
kinetic energy of this cart.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:19.200
So behind the propeller, there would
be, say, eight kilometer per hour,

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.460
wind and everywhere else, there
would be 10 kilometer per hour wind.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:28.590
So the energy from this wind behind
the propeller has gone into the

00:19:28.591 --> 00:19:30.960
cart into accelerating it forwards.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.470
So it is moving forward
faster than the wind.

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:37.980
Even when this is moving
forward, faster than wind speed,

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:41.220
the propeller can still
push the air backwards,

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:45.750
slowing down that tailwind and
taking some of that wind's energy,

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.900
converting it into the kinetic
energy of this vehicle.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.520
Now the people who made Blackbird
managed to get a record,

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:57.060
they got up to 2.8 times the wind speed.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:01.860
So it is obvious to me from all of the
demonstrations and from riding in the

00:20:01.861 --> 00:20:05.490
vehicle myself, that this
is physically possible.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:10.440
There is a way to drive a vehicle that
goes downwind faster than the wind.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:15.150
But I know it is so counterintuitive
that I expect a lot of pushback in the

00:20:15.151 --> 00:20:18.300
comments. My only request
is please be civil.

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:34.790
Hey, this video was sponsored by Kiwico
a company that makes awesome hands-on

00:20:34.791 --> 00:20:35.930
projects for kids.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:40.220
Now the big idea is that while playing
and having fun kids learn about STEAM

00:20:40.221 --> 00:20:44.390
concepts, that is science, technology,
engineering, art, and math.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.250
When I pull out a crate, my kids
jump at chance to make it with me.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.330
And what's really handy is that all the
materials you need come right in the

00:20:52.331 --> 00:20:57.040
box. And that means no running out to
the store. You just open it up and go.

00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:01.120
Now in this one, we learned about
aerodynamics like lift and drag.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.590
And in addition to the project,

00:21:02.591 --> 00:21:05.380
there's a magazine with
lots of additional content.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:07.990
Now I think this is the best way to learn,

00:21:07.991 --> 00:21:10.630
by doing something
yourself and having fun.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.750
This is how education
really should be. Now.

00:21:13.751 --> 00:21:17.050
Kiwico has eight subscription
lines targeted at different
age groups all the way

00:21:17.051 --> 00:21:20.590
down to newborns. So if you want to try
it out, go to Kiwico.com/veritasium50

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.050
and you'll get 50% off your
first month of any crate.

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:28.810
Now I will put that link
down in the description.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.760
So I want to thank Kiwico for sponsoring
Veritasium and I want to thank you for

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:36.240
watching. Stop it? You
can push the button now.
