00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
For most of us, thinking
is at least somewhat unpleasant.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.500
We try to avoid it, where possible.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.100
For example:

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.680
I asked these guys how long does it take for the earth to go around the Sun.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.000
- What do you reckon, cuz?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.400
- Isn't it 24 hours ?
- Obviously a day, yes.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.440
Or take this problem

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.120
which has been given to thousands of college students.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.000
You go into a toy store,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.400
and there's a toy bat and a toy ball.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.200
Together they cost 1.10$.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.280
And the bat costs a dollar more than the ball.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.000
How much does the ball cost ?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
- Ten cents.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.300
- We're all wrong aren't we?

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.260
- WHAT'S THE ANSWER ?

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.700
If you think about it for just a second

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.400
it's obvious that the ball can't cost ten cents,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.870
because if it did, then the bat

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.550
would cost 1.10$ and the two items

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.500
together would cost 1.20$.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.350
The correct answer is five cents.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.600
Now, the point of these questions is not that they're difficult.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.220
Any of these people

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.200
could have quickly check their answer if they wanted to.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.860
The point is that they don't check

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.220
because thinking is uncomfortable.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.660
It takes effort.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.520
- Hey, the Earth doesn't take one day to get around the Sun.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.720
- Takes like a year!

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.680
[LAUGHS]

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.120
Now, I think it would be easy to put these mistakes down to

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.960
stupidity,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.440
and believe that you, being much smarter, could never fall into such traps.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.680
But then I think you'd be fooling yourself.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.260
I think these examples reveal blind spots in all of our thinking

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.900
due to the fundamental way that our brains work .

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.400
Now, one way of modeling how the brain

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.380
operates is as though there are two

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.940
systems at work

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.500
psychologists call them system one and

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.600
system two but maybe it's useful to

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.490
think of them as characters so let's

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.070
call system one Gun and system two Drew.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.830
You are Drew. he represents your

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.000
conscious thought,  the voice in your head.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.479
&lt;Drew&gt;"I am who you think you are"

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.700
he's the one capable of following instructions.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.900
He can execute a series of steps.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.260
If you are asked to calculate 13 x 17 in your head, for example,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.700
he is the one who has to do it.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.500
&lt;Drew&gt;"can just use my calculator?"

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.820
no...&lt;Drew&gt;"all right, um, seventeen times...."

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.780
Drew is lazy

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.600
it takes effort to get Drew to do anything

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.100
and he is slow but he's the careful one,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.040
capable of catching and fixing mistakes...

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.400
&lt;Drew&gt;"221".

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.200
Now meet system one Gun.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.900
He is incredibly quick,

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.720
which he needs to be since he's constantly

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.100
processing copious amounts of

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.390
information coming in through your

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.730
senses. He picks out the relevant bits

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.519
and discard the rest, which is most of it,

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.010
and he works automatically without you,

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.290
Drew,  being consciously aware of what

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.480
he is doing. For example when you spot

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.370
them text he reads it before you can

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.959
even decide whether or not you want to

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:38.709
read it

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.590
Gun fills in the gaps. For example, what

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.700
does this say?

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.250
Did you notice that the "H" in 'the'

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.500
'A' in 'cat' are actually the same symbol

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.209
but you had no trouble reading it

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.130
because Gun made the correct, automatic,

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.620
assumption, so although Drew is unaware

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.510
of what Gun is doing,  its Guns

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.310
perceptions that become the basis for

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.560
your conscious thoughts.  The way I like

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.310
to think of it

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.110
each of these characters is related to

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.540
one of your main memory structures,  Guns

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.580
automatic responses are made possible by

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.470
long-term memory, the library of

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.000
experiences you've built up over your

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.640
lifetime.  In contrast, Drew exists

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.770
entirely within working memory so he's

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.870
only capable of holding four or five

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.950
novel things in mind

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.660
at a time.  This is perhaps one of the

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.760
best-known findings from psychology.  That

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.709
our capacity to hold and manipulate

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.660
novel information is incredibly limited

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.879
like when trying to remember a string of

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:34.989
random numbers.  "6 7    5 5  3        1"

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.500
(offscreen)Yes!   But we are able to overcome these

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.880
limitations if the information is

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.160
familiar to us. For example, let me give

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.019
you four random digits "7102".  Now these would

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.519
normally take up most of your working

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.890
memory capacity just to remember, but, if

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.860
you reverse them, 2017, there now just one

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.200
thing the present year the process of

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.610
grouping things together according to

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.959
your prior knowledge is called chunking

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.880
and you can actually hold four or five

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.069
chunks in working memory at once.  So the

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.209
larger the chunks

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.620
the more information you can actively

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.590
manipulate at one time.  Learning is then,

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.420
the process of building more and bigger

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.370
chunks by storing and further connecting

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.510
information in long-term memory

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.180
essentially passing off tasks from Drew

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.340
to Gun.  But in order for this to happen,

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.959
Drew first has to engage with the

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.880
information actively and effort-fully,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.370
often multiple times. For example, when

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.419
you were first learning to tie your

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.700
shoelaces, you probably recited a rhyme to

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.500
help you remember what to do next

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.150
using up all your working memory in the

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.460
process.  But after doing it over and over

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.740
and over again,  it gradually became

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.630
automatic,  that is, Drew doesn't have to

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.430
think about it anymore because Guns got it.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.860
Musicians and sports stars refer to this

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.900
as muscle memory, though of course, the memory

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.250
is not the muscles

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.690
it's still in the brain just controlled

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.360
by Gun.  "You can practice everything

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.090
exactly as it is, and exactly as it's written

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.620
but at just such a speed that you have to

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.930
think about and know exactly where you

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.400
are and what your fingers are doing and what

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.780
it feels like."      Slow deliberate conscious

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.360
practice repeated often enough, leads to this:

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:18.560
&lt;harp music&gt;

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.600
I bet 99% of the time what appears to be

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.660
superhuman ability, comes down to the

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.370
incredible automation skills of Gun,

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.870
developed through the painstaking

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.570
deliberate practice of Drew.  What's

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.250
interesting is, its actually possible to

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.199
see how hard Drew is working, just by

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.570
looking at someone.  Try this task: I'm

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.310
going to show you four digits, I want you

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.750
to read them out loud and then after two

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.669
beats,  I want you to say each number back

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.720
on the beat, but adding one to each digit.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.320
So,  as an example,  7 2 9 1 (beats in background)

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.480
should be...

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.460
8

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.520
3

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.540
0

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.300
2

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.180
This is called the Add One task and it

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.530
forces Drew to hold these digits and

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.360
memory while making manipulations to

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.560
them. Now it's important to say the

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.220
numbers back on the beat.  Try this one:

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:07.060
(beats in background at regular interval)

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.940
To make it harder, you can try adding 3

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.140
instead of 1.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.440
Ready?

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.380
(beats in background at regular interval)

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.050
Now what you're unaware of, is that, as

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.700
you're completing this task, your pupils

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.620
are dilating.  When Drew is hard at work,

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.600
as he is in this task, you have a

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.280
physiological response: including

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.870
increased heart rate, sweat production,

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.680
and pupil dilation.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.360
Watch how the pupils of these participants enlarge as they

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.900
perform the Add One and Add Three tasks.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.280
4...3...9...7...2

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.760
(beats in backrgound)

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.960
5...4...0...8...3

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.760
(offscreen) Excellent! nicely done.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.500
(offscreen conversation)..."this requires a lot of thinking"  "I know, that's the point &lt;laughter&gt;

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.100
6     9     1     6

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.500
7     0     2     7

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.260
When this research was originally carried out the researchers

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.280
made a surprising observation: when the

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.020
participants were not engaged with the

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.460
tasks that were just chatting with the

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.560
experimenters their pupils didn't really

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.090
dilate at all..

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.710
this indicates that the Add One and Add Three

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.720
tasks are particularly strenuous

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.820
for system two, and that most of our

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.800
day-to-day life is a stroll for Drew

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.080
with most tasks handled automatically by

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.390
Gun.  Just as we spend a lot of our lives

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.430
lounging around, our brains spend most of

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.600
their time doing the mental equivalent.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.960
And I don't mean to make that sound like a

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.130
bad thing, this is how our brains evolved

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.200
to make the best use of resources. For

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.150
repetitive tasks we developed automatic

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.830
ways of doing things, reserving Drew's

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.630
limited capacity for things that really

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.780
need our attention, but in some

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.980
circumstances there can be mix-ups.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.320
For example, I moved to Australia in 2004 and

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.910
one of the first things I learned was

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:50.740
that turn the lights on you flick the

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.600
switch down.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.620
My whole life growing up in Canada Gun had automated that 'up' means

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.840
'on', so no matter how well I, Drew, knew

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.090
that 'down' was 'on' in Australia I would

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.860
for years, continually switch the lights

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.990
off when entering a room and on when

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.240
leaving.  When Destin learn to ride the

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.830
backwards bicycle with its steering

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.930
reverse it took months to overcome his

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.669
automated habitat and once he had done

00:08:12.669 --> 00:08:14.169
that he couldn't easily go back to

00:08:14.169 --> 00:08:16.390
writing a normal bike.  Understanding Gun

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.250
and Drew also explains errors in the "Bat

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.560
and Ball" question. Its Gun who first

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.880
perceived the key pieces of information

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.860
that, together the bat and ball cost a

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.260
dollar ten, The bat costs more than the ball

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.160
so the ball costs...

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:27.840
Gun: "Ten cents"

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.360
Drew: "Ten cents"

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.940
Gun imediately had a answer that he

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.380
blurted out automatically.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.150
Meanwhile Drew, without being consciously

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.830
aware that the answer came from Gun

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.750
endorsed the idea without checking it,

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.400
after all the answers sounded reasonable

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.260
and drew is lazy

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.120
so how do you get Drew to do more

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.400
work? Well researchers have found at least one

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.260
way. When they gave out a clearly printed

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.880
test including the "Bat and Ball"question

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.580
to incoming college students 85% got at

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.589
least one wrong but when they printed

00:08:53.589 --> 00:08:55.510
the test in a hard-to-read font with

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.310
poor contrast the error rate dropped to

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.010
thirty-five percent harder to read test

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.200
resulted in more correct answers and the

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.180
explanation for this is simple. Since Gun

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.310
can't quickly jump to an answer he hands

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.440
off the task to Drew who then invest the

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.150
required mental effort to reason his way

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.339
to the correct answer. When something is

00:09:12.339 --> 00:09:14.380
confusing, Drew worked harder and when

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.790
Drew work harder you're more likely to

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.580
reach the right answer and remember the experience.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.600
This is something i think the advertising industry knows about and is

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.130
using to its advantage.  A few years ago,

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.980
again in Australia, I saw a giant

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.420
billboard that had just two letters on it

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.850
"Un".  There was no logo, no indication of

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:31.870
what it was for

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.160
and this seems to go against all the

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.140
basic principles of advertising:  to show

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.520
what the product does, how it's better than

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.080
the competition, and use clear

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.760
branding and maybe a jingle to make it

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.070
memorable. The goal is usually to make

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:44.020
the message as easy to understand as

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.730
possible so Drew doesn't have to work

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.530
very hard, but if you look at a lot of

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.900
effective advertising today, it's changed

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.420
to be more confusing.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.640
as the "Un" campaign rolled out across Sydney, I saw ads like

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.280
this one in bus shelters.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.260
"Un" explained. With 'Un' there is no stress, just unstress

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.620
no hassle, just unhastle with 'Un' you

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.570
can undo what you did, you can undrive

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:05.740
through the car wash with the window

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.720
down or unbreak dance in front of your

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.209
teenage son. And his mates.  'Un' makes life

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:12.480
relaxing and unreal. 'Un' your life. Be

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.680
happy and live for now. Don't worry. Unworry.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.640
Can you guess what the ads were for?

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.740
They're actually for insurance.  Now that

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.730
advertising is everywhere, Gun is skilled

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:23.770
at filtering it out. Its automatic, if I

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:25.690
just saw another insurance ad that I never

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.250
would have given it a second thought, but

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.260
something that doesn't make sense, thats

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.030
something Gun can't deal with, so he

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.520
hands it off to Drew

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.500
This same realization has been happening

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.330
in education: lectures which have long

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.010
been the dominant teaching method, are

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.960
now on the decline. Like the old form of

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.270
advertising, they're too easy to tune out

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.130
and often, especially in science lectures,

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.840
too many new pieces of information are

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.060
presented, and that exceeds Drew's

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.380
capacity because he doesn't have big

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.390
enough chunks to break the material into.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.550
In place of lectures, universities are

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.140
introducing workshops, peer instruction

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.150
and formats where students are forced to

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.010
answer more questions, do more work than

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.170
just listen and take notes, and this will

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:02.940
undoubtedly make Drew work harder,

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.230
which is good because that's how

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.360
learning happens, but a lot of students

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.160
don't like it because it requires more

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.990
effort.  Just as it's hard to motivate

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.160
someone to get off the couch and

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.410
exercise, it's hard to get Drew to give

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.810
his full effort. There's an appeal to

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.970
doing things you already know, for the

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.310
musician to play the same familiar songs

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.560
that Gun has already automated, that feel

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.900
and sound good. To watch videos that give

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.580
you the sensation of understanding

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.830
without actually learning anything. To

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.660
always drive with the GPS on so you

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.550
never get lost, but you also never

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.070
learn the way. If you really want to

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.990
learn and get better at anything, have

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:38.940
any chance of becoming an expert, you

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.800
have to be willing to be uncomfortable.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.620
Because thinking takes effort, it

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.600
involves fighting through confusion, and

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.160
for most of us

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:56.899
that's at least somewhat unpleasant.
