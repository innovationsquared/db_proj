00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.940
What would it look like to ride alongside a beam of light?

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.620
This is a question Einstein had asked over a hundred years ago.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.660
Now the trouble was, he couldn't actually do the experiment

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.980
so he had to use his imagination;

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.160
he had to do a thought experiment

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.720
to figure out what a reasonable outcome would be.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.500
I could imagine there'd be some element of nausea.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.860
I'd imagine everything would get more intense.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.500
Maybe it would confuse the brain; I don't really know if you'd be seeing very much.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.360
I was on a water slide just a couple of days ago and I found that really difficult.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.100
Einstein's intuition told him that the world should feel the same in all frames of reference moving with constant velocity.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.020
These are called inertial frames of reference.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.920
So it doesn't matter if you're in a train, or on a plane, or in a car, or in a room

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.200
As long as you're moving with constant velocity

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.300
[All four] The laws of physics should apply in exactly the same way.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.540
And this is what's called the principle of relativity.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.620
–Is there a speed limit in the universe?

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.840
–I don't think so.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.360
–You can go as fast as you want?

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.260
–Probably

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.760
–Could we go as fast as light?

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.640
–Ah, I'm sure eventually, absolutely!

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.380
–Can you compare the speed of sound and the speed of light?

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.480
–Well, it's however many times quicker, isn't it?

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.980
because you've got the lightning and thunder.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.760
–Roughly how much quicker is light?

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.380
–Ten times.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.980
–Roughly ten times?

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.700
–Ten times, I think, is it ten? or a hundred, I don't know.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.340
Something like that.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.260
–The answer for you is—a million.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.760
–Oh!

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.080
–Light is a million times faster than sound.(Damn)

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.260
–Perhaps thought? or...

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.040
–Thought is faster than light?

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.180
–Yeah, it's immediate! it's there.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.720
Let's do a little thought experiment.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.200
Let's say I'm on a train travelling the speed of light that way.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.820
Who am I kidding, this is city rail! We're lucky to be moving.(I looking at you Chicago and New York)

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.540
But, let's use our imaginations.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.760
So let's say I'm travelling at the speed of light this way.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.380
If I hold up a mirror in front of my face,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.280
will I be able to see my reflection?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.220
Do you see the problem?

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.140
In order for me to see my reflection,

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.200
light has to bounce off my face and travel to the mirror.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.560
But if the mirror is going forward at the speed of light,

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.120
how is the light ever going to catch up?

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.880
So, a logical answer would be that

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:14.120
no, you can't see your face in a mirror when you're on a train travelling at the speed of light.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.120
But that violates the principle of relativity because

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.540
it means that I can tell I'm in a frame of reference that's going at the speed of light that way.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.420
Aw, crap, not again!

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.720
So let's consider the other option.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.740
Maybe I do see my reflection

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.960
which means the light must travel from my face, to the mirror,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.380
at its regular speed—the speed of light.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.360
But now the problem is,

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.300
someone outside the train would see light travelling at twice the speed of light

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.780
because I'm already travelling at the speed of light, and the light is travelling at the speed of light relative to me

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.700
if that makes any sense.(Not really)

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.740
So, that leads to a really inconsistent answer

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.860
because how can the speed of light be twice the speed of light in that frame of reference?

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.220
So Einstein's conclusion was that

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.380
I must see my reflection; because otherwise, it violates the principle of relativity.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.420
But in order for me inside the train to measure the same speed of light as someone outside the train,

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.400
the train must actually contract in the direction that it's moving.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.540
And, my time must tick by slower relative to someone outside.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.300
So Einstein changed what we thought were absolutes—space and time—

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.180
and made something that seemed like it should be relative—the speed of light—into the true universal constant. (Mind Blown yet?)

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.800
So what would it look like to travel alongside a beam of light?

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.180
Well, according to einstein, we'll never know,

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.160
because we can't go that fast.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.520
At that speed,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.420
our length would become zero;

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.820
time would stop relative to an outside observer;

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.300
and perhaps worst of all, our mass would become infinite.(No Mass Effect here guys)

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.720
but a recent experimental result has suggested that neutrinos can go faster than light.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.700
Still, most physicists think that, well, this result probably won't hold up to scrutiny

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.340
because the principle of relativity is just so well established nowadays.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.720
But who knows! Perhaps one day,

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.640
we'll find a way to break what we thought was the universal speed limit—the speed of light.
