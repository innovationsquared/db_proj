00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.880
I'm here at the National Institute for Standards and Technology, and

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.480
I'm about to see some of the original kilogram standards. Is that right?

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.360
Patrick: You are, you are.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.100
When were these made?

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.600
Well the originals were made in the 1880s.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.600
There were 40 of them that were brethren of the

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.280
International prototype kilogram

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.550
and these 40 were distributed to the signatories

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.070
of the Treaty of the meter and the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.780
United States was given two, K4 and K20.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.840
What was this meter agreement?

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.578
The treaty of the meter?

00:00:34.578 --> 00:00:35.100
Yeah, what is that?

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.640
It's the modern-day foundation of the metric system.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.379
So the U.S. signed that?

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.572
The U.S. signed it.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.040
As if they were going to become metric?

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.640
Yes.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.800
A little known secret and I'll tell you something else

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.610
that all the units that we commonly use

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.280
like feet and gallons and so on are

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.740
actually defined in terms of metric units.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.440
So it's just a little translation

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.070
that we do here but our country is

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.520
actually on the metric system.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.040
[Laughter]

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.740
Doesn't that seem crazy?

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.580
Yes!

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.700
Isn't that insane that like you base all of these measurements on the metric

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.630
system and then you add a conversion

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.090
factor and then later some people have

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.800
to convert back.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.560
Yes, it's stupid.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.460
[Laughter]

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.880
Are you allowed to say that?

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.040
It's true.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.740
So can we see it?

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.280
sure sure

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.360
What do we have to do?

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.560
This requires that we go through

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.720
some high-security gear and also that

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.450
would be somewhat clean in what we do

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.610
so I'll have to ask you to put on some

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.234
booties here.

00:01:39.234 --> 00:01:40.530
Let me see if I can do this

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.460
all right so, did I do it?

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.340
Yep, there you go.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.400
straight back, all the way there you go.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.640
This is the first

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.593
BootieButler that I've ever...

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.060
I'm a big fan.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.580
This is the first layer.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.500
Secret code

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.240
I'm going to show you two I'm going to

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.540
show you one of the originals and I'm

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.160
going to show you a more modern version

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.980
This is K 20.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.260
Oh my goodness that is like the

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.420
original kilogram mass standard of the US.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.480
That's right.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.960
I never thought I would

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.100
get this close to it

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.870
virtually every mass that has been

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.550
accurately weighed in the US over the

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.830
past hundred and thirty years can trace

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.780
its measurement back to this one

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.980
kilogram hunk of 90 percent platinum 10 percent iridium.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.730
Iridium makes the alloy much

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.560
harder than pure platinum and both

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.850
elements were selected for their high

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.280
density and resistance to oxidation this

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.830
kilogram was created in the same way at

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.020
around the same time as an object which

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.630
to this day remains the definition of

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.700
the kilogram an identical cylinder

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.290
stored in a basement vault on the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.880
outskirts of Paris.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.020
If you look straight

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.070
down from the top you can maybe see K 20

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.050
doesn't have a very nice finish on it

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.170
compared to the more modern prototypes

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.680
here's K 92 so it's got a much higher

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.769
polish on it different manufacturing

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.410
techniques absolutely no swirls it is a

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.480
really like beautiful looking specimen

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.330
yes it is I mean is there a reason why

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.820
you want it to look so beautiful?

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.000
well you want it not to be very rough

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.610
because roughness increases surface area

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.010
surface area increases the probability

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.500
that you will get contaminants on that

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.989
will change the mass of the entire thing

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.670
how much is it worth

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.220
well monetarily the new ones are about

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.269
$100,000 a piece if you were to buy one

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.570
oh my goodness so but if you think about

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.530
K 20 K for with about 130 years of

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.110
history they're priceless you could

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.970
never replace them the purpose of this

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.220
room then is to share the precise mass

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.989
of K 20 with anyone who wants to make a

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.840
measurement without sharing K 20 itself

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.140
what we do in this suite here is we

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.030
transfer the definition of the kilogram

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.670
from the platinum-iridium prototypes to

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.799
stainless steel secondary standards and

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.049
you can tell that they're a lot bigger

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.409
and the platinum-iridium prototypes and

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:21.599
that's because of the relative

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.520
difference in density the density of

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.659
stainless steel is about 8 grams per

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:30.000
cubic centimeter whereas the density of

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.530
platinum iridium is about 21.5 grams per

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.509
cubic centimeter so there's all of the

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.009
three times difference in density which

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.379
tells you why this is so much bigger in

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:42.389
volume and that creates a problem

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.400
ordinarily we don't worry much about the

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.289
buoyant force that is the upward force

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.419
on every object in the atmosphere equal

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.490
to the weight of air it displaces but

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.469
since the volumes of these masses are so

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:54.509
different a stainless steel object that

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:56.639
has around the same mass as k20 can have

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.409
its weight reduced due to buoyancy by

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:00.509
around 110 milligrams

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.159
the precise amount depends on the

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:04.110
temperature pressure and humidity of the

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.629
air that's why the mass comparator

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:09.030
itself is inside of a chamber here

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.069
that's isolated from the outside world

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:12.389
so that the temperature remains

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.280
relatively stable I'm the humidity the

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.680
same pressure is by far the biggest

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.500
contributor to air density so we don't

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.120
want it changing all over the place with

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.830
the weather the problem scientists are

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.479
having with the kilogram now is much

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.580
bigger than weather fluctuations it's

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.050
something they discovered when all the

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.849
original kilograms were returned to

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:32.909
Paris for a weigh-in including k20 how

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:36.300
did it get there it gets there by a

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.849
person hand carrying it each prototype

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:42.000
gets taken out of the bell jar and put

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.949
in its container how do we sound after

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.240
we get it in there all nicely secured

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.090
then we wrap the whole thing in bubble

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.259
wrap and put it in a camera bag and

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:04.259
sling it over our shoulders don't let it

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:05.400
out of our sight it sounds a little

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.319
casual so you actually like while you're

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:09.389
on the plane do you put it in like the

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.520
overhead stretch

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.190
know it stay just at all times like it's

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.680
a you know the nuclear football codes

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.289
were setting off a nuclear weapon and

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:20.880
you never have any scares while you're

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.190
carrying the only scare comes that

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.960
somebody wants to see it like a customs

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.880
official I've never had to open it

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.789
although I had a kind of a scary moment

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:32.250
at one time when they asked me what it

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.630
was made of and I told them it was

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.599
platinum iridium and somebody heard the

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:39.300
word iridium and connected that with

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.030
radioactivity no no and kind of you know

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.919
flew off the handle a little bit and I

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:46.440
had to calm them down on the shoreland

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.060
that it wasn't radioactive there was no

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.440
threats going on here

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.509
the real threat was the unreliable

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:53.220
weight and the kilogram mass standard

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.680
what they do is a series of comparisons

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.409
they compare every one of those with the

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:01.020
International prototype kilogram using

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.030
that data and plotting it it looked as

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.210
if there had been a change in the

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.470
International prototype that made it

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.370
about 50 micrograms heavier than one

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.289
kilogram now over the course of a

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:14.490
hundred years all right

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.159
but the interesting thing is if one

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:18.870
looks at the data that was recently

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.949
taken at the end of 2013 international

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:25.080
prototype kilogram did not show an

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.050
increasing mass telling me for several

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.820
decades it was gaining mass and also on

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.360
the stop which you know I find that hard

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.550
to explain but it seemed like all of the

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.250
40 masses in to be somewhat diverging at

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.740
that weigh-in they went different ways

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.259
they went in different directions yes so

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:46.020
that some changed a lot some changed

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.180
little some hardly changed at all but

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.229
it's hard to tell I mean they could

00:07:49.229 --> 00:07:51.449
we'll all be changing a lot but because

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:52.560
all you can tell is the difference

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.880
between them they've already married

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.259
all that matters is the difference

00:07:55.259 --> 00:07:58.199
between them and the International

00:07:58.199 --> 00:07:59.580
prototype because the International

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.380
prototype is the only thing you need the

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.940
only thing that you really know because

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.210
it's defined as one kilogram

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.699
right but I mean the outside of that

00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:09.960
definition there's a chance it could

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.240
have gained you know five grams as long

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.860
as they all gain five grams you know I'm

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.750
having these ridiculous obviously it's

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.030
ridiculous but the point is they could

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.349
have all been gaining or they could all

00:08:19.349 --> 00:08:21.960
been losing right it's a relative

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.460
measurement and that's the weakness of

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.060
the system

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.720
and that's why as of 2018 the kilogram

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.669
will no longer be defined as the mass of

00:08:29.669 --> 00:08:37.590
a metal cylinder why if you want to find

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:39.210
out how the kilogram will be redefined

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:43.070
