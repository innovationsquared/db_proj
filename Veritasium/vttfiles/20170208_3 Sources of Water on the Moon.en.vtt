00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.860
Is there water on the Moon

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.340
The obvious answer seems to be No.
because during a day

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.460
on the Moon, which lasts 2 earth weeks,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.840
the temperature on the lunar surface

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.820
gets up to 123 degrees celsius,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.420
which would be enough to boil away any water

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.820
if the Moon had an atmosphere like Earth,

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.020
which it doesn't.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.060
And the reason that it doesn't

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.400
is because the Moon's gravity is weak,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.060
just a sixth of Earth's gravity, which means

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.099
it can't hold onto light fast moving

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.380
molecules like water. Anything going

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.570
faster than 2.4 kilometers per second

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.000
the Moon's escape velocity is gone.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.800
But that might sound pretty quick, but at any

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.360
given temperature there are always a

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.120
small number of molecules going

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.880
significantly faster than the average.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.520
On the Moon

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.530
these molecules flap into space and then

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.660
other molecules take their place until

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.059
all the light fast moving molecules

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:51.840
are gone.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.730
Plus, since the Moon has a very weak

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.469
magnetic field, there's little to protect

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.969
the lunar surface from the solar wind.

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.010
That's the stream of charged particles

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.800
coming from the Sun. These particles can

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.870
effectively blast molecules from the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.119
surface of the Moon into space.

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.139
In fact that's how Mars lost most of its atmosphere.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.460
So in short, if the Moon ever

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.880
had any water, it should be long gone by now.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.500
And this appeared to be confirmed by

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.369
the Moon landings. Rock samples brought

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.249
back by Apollo astronauts

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:22.149
contained virtually no hydrated minerals.

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.420
Some water was detected but it was assumed

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.490
just to be terrestrial contamination

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.470
rather than actual Moon water, because

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.939
seals on some of the sample-return

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.079
containers were damaged by the gritty moondust.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.220
But in 2009 a very different

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.020
picture emerged, when scientists

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.180
intentionally crashed part of a rocket

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.220
into the surface of the Moon.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.160
It was going two point five kilometers per second

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.420
on impact, making a crater 25 meters wide

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.340
and 4 meters deep.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.380
That injected 10,000 tons of material

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.900
with half of it making high enough to be lit

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.189
by the Sun. That allowed cameras on an

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.929
orbiting spacecraft, to look for the

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.380
emission lines of water in the dust.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.760
And what did they find ?

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.160
The water emission lines were bright.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.840
Scientists estimated that five

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.590
point six percent the mass of the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.880
objective debris was water.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.130
but how is this possible? Where did the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.330
water come from and hadn't remain

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.460
on the Moon?

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.230
Well strangely enough, there are actually

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.510
three different sources of lunar water.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.490
To understand the first source, you just

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.350
have to look at where they crashed that

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.450
rocket into theMmoon. Now it's a

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.230
misconception that the Moon has

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.320
a dark side.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.620
Although the same side always faces earth,

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.440
all sides of the Moon do receive

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.310
sunlight.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.380
However, at the poles there are some

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.400
craters which due to their location and depth,

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.380
are always in shade. They're called

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.450
but permanently shadowed regions.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.010
Now since they never see the Sun,

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.240
these craters are some of the coldest places

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.580
in the whole solar system, colder than

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.920
the surface of Pluto. They can reach

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.730
negative 249 celcius. And it is here that

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.680
scientists decided to crash that piece

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.750
of rocket. Since the permanently shadowed

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.850
regions maintain such a consistently low

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.340
temperature, they act as cold traps

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.260
places where volatiles like water

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.600
remained frozen as ice.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.480
But, where the water come from in the first place?

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.620
Well, from water containing comets

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.900
and asteroids that have struck the Moon over time.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.880
Any water molecules that found

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.870
their way to the permanently shadowed regions

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.600
would be trapped there. Forever.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.060
as ice but this is not the only source

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.530
of water on the Moon.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.550
In a lunar samples from Apollo 15 and 17,

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.200
scientists found tiny glass beads.
These beads were formed

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.250
back when the Moon was still

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.440
volcanically active. Fire fountains

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.960
launch droplets of lava into space, where

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.820
they cooled rapidly and then fell back

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.850
to the surface. In 2007 these beads were

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.340
sliced in half and tested for water.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.350
The results showed significant amount of

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.360
water with concentrations highest in the

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.000
middle of the beads, and this indicates

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.820
that the water must have been trapped there

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.660
during the initial eruption, rather

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.640
than leaching in due to contamination

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.040
once those beads were back on earth.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.950
Now, this water came from the interior of

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.959
the Moon. So the Moon must have contained

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.939
water to begin with, which kind of makes sense

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.520
considering the Moon is likely a

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.709
piece of Earth that broke off billions

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.930
of years ago in an impact with a mars-sized

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:14.860
body.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.660
The third and final source of water

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.959
on the Moon is : Water created on the Moon

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.759
surface from the reaction of oxygen and hydrogen.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.180
Now, the source of oxygen is easy.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.400
Oxygen makes up

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.230
45 percent of the lunar surface

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.170
mostly bounded oxide mineral. But where

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.630
do you get the free hydrogen? The answer

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.570
is in the solar wind, which is constantly

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.910
bombarding the Moon surface with protons.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.590
These can react with oxygen, to form

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.630
hydroxide, and ultimately water.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.220
This water can then drift over the surface of

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.740
the Moon until either flys off into space,

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.940
or it lands in the cold traps and becomes ice.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.060
So there is water on the Moon.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.030
And this is important because

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.780
it means that future missions can take

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.640
advantage of this valuable resource.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.000
Not only for Moon colonists to drink and

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.590
grow crops, but also for processing into

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.870
rocket fuel. If you can make your own

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.280
rocket fuel on the Moon, that

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.410
dramatically reduces the challenges and

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.650
cost of space travel. For a long time we

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.540
used to think the Moon was completely dry.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.820
But now we know that hypothesis is all wet.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.080
Big news! I have a brand new channel

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.900
called Sciencium, posting videos in this format.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.340
So if you enjoyed this video,

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.780
you should go check out that channel

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.860
and subscribe to it.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.840
the more of you who do, the more videos I will make

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.580
over there. Now, making this new channel

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.680
was made possible by Google's making and

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.930
science initiative, team that seeks to

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.460
inspire people to learn more about

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.680
science and pursue their science goals.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.030
And of course none of this would be possible

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.170
without your support on patreon.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.810
so I want to thank you for supporting me,

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.370
and I want to thank Google for making it

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.470
possible for me to pursue my science

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.750
goals and make a new channel all about

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.950
awesome discoveries in science.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.150
So if you click on this link,

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:07.260
I will see you over on the new channel.
