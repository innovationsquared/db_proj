00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.500
If you eat just one carrot every day,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.200
that provides all the vitamin A you need to survive.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.180
But in some parts of the world, that's not easy to come by.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.260
There are an estimated 250 million preschool-aged children who are vitamin A deficient.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.000
Most of them are in Africa and Southeast Asia, like here in India.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.980
Of those, about 250,000 to 500,000 are severely vitamin A deficient.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.650
When that happens, they get night blindness,

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.130
which means as the Sun goes down they lose their ability to see.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.560
Now if you catch the condition at that point, and

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.280
give a child just a few high dose vitamin A supplements,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.360
their sight can be restored within 24 to 48 hours.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.360
It's like a miracle cure.

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.840
But if you don't, well the condition can continue to worsen until they're completely blind.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.420
And of those children who are completely blind,

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.780
roughly half die in the following 12 months.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.809
These are all things I learned while working on a new feature length

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.460
90-minute documentary called "Vitamania", all about these sense and nonsense of vitamins.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.480
And I am not only the presenter of this documentary,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.420
I'm also one of the co-executive producers.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.800
And you can watch this documentary right now.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.400
It is live, on the web, for everywhere in the world

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.160
except France and Germany because it's coming to your TVs.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.940
But I will put a link to it,

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.600
Vitamania the Movie", in the description

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.500
and right here. And I want to show you a trailer

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.800
for this film, so you get a sense of what it looks like, what it's all about.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.660
It's something I've been working on for two and a half years,

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.100
so I'm really proud of it, and I just want you  to go and check it out.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.100
So here is the trailer.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:52.720
In 1913, Antarctic explorers Douglas Mawson and Xavier Mertz were fighting for their lives.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.580
With most of their food gone, they faced a stark choice:

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.720
Eat their dogs, or die.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:07.560
[MUSIC]

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.780
After reluctantly eating their dogs,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.080
the men fell ill, burning with fever.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.120
Within days, Mertz was dead.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.080
Mawson, against the odds, made it back to camp.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.100
So what was the mystery illness that killed Mertz,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.160
and nearly cost Mawson his life?

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.740
Well, when they ate their dogs,

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.720
they weren't just eating canine flesh and fat.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.980
They also ate the dog's livers,

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.880
which contain high levels of vitamin A.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.600
So basically, they overdosed.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.000
It's a condition known as Hypervitaminosis A.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.500
Hypervitaminosis A is rare but deadly,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.860
and today we know it can be caused by

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.820
overuse of high-dose vitamin A supplements -

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.720
the same kind of supplements

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.880
that can save a child's sight.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.280
This power and complexity

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.420
lies at the heart of the great vitamin story.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:21.180
[MUSIC]

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.840
I'm embarking on an epic world-spanning investigation

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.960
of vitamin science and history.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.260
"Aargh!"

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.020
"That is one big fish!"

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.548
I want to know how we discovered them,

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.080
“You sure this is safe?”

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.000
what they actually are,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.780
“The 13 vitamins can be divided into two teams.”

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.700
how we learnt to build them,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.940
“Tonight, Walgreens and Target have pulled the products nationwide-”

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.640
and how safe they are.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.040
“All vitamins - all nutrients - they are toxic in high amounts."

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.560
“We've got to start taking these seriously,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.920
as we should with every chemical we put into our bodies.”

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.480
I'm a scientist.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.740
I'm also a father, and I want to know,

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.200
how do I do the best for my son.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.100
And one day, might he be taking vitamin pills to Mars?

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.880
[ROCKET LAUNCHING]

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.120
Across the world, some experts claim that taking vitamins can be lifesavers,

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.820
whereas others argue that it's just a waste of time or even dangerous.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.600
So how are we supposed to know whether to take them or not?

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.660

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.720
