00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
We take it for granted that our universe
contains planets, stars and galaxies

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.740
because those are the things we see but
the only reason these big structures

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.199
exist is because of the nature of
nothingness - empty space. But to

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.400
understand why we have to go back to the
beginning. The very beginning. The big bang.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.720
You know, I always thought that in
the Big Bang the observable universe

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.650
started as a point and then just
expanded steadily more or less to the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.830
point that we're at today but that's not
actually how it happened.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.399
There were four different phases in the universe's
expansion. To start it was expanding

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.770
steadily but then after just a tiny
fraction of a second the expansion just

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.870
blew up and the whole universe increased
in size by like ten to the twenty six

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.660
times in a very short period of time and
that period is known as inflation and

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.640
then just as abruptly as it began
inflation stopped and after that the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.650
universe continued expanding but at a
decreasing rate so the expansion of the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.479
universe was actually slowing down which
is exactly what you expect if the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.110
universe is full of massive objects that
gravitationally attract each other

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.009
but then about five or six billion years
ago the expansion of the universe

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.040
started speeding up again and this is
thought to be caused by dark energy,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.259
an energy tied to space. So before that time
there was enough matter, the matter

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.070
density was high enough, that it was
pulling everything back together slowing

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.850
down the expansion but once the universe
reached a critical size

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.040
well then there was enough dark energy
to start pushing things apart and that

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.300
is the phase that we're still in the
expansion of the universe is accelerating.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.160
Now, this story doesn't
really explain the formation of galaxies

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.860
until you tie in the nature of
nothingness

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.689
now ordinarily we think of everything
around us as made of particles of atoms

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.009
and electrons but our best theories of
physics are actually field theories that

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.560
say all these particles should be seen
as just excitations in fields.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.720
The word "field" always gets me because it makes me
think of... well, fields.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.060
but a field is just something that has
a value everywhere in space.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.220
So every subatomic particle has its own field: an
electron field, an up quark field,

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.820
a down quark field, a neutrino field, and so on...

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.100
And anywhere there's an excitation in this field

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.360
that is some energy in the
field

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.520
well that is where we will observe
particles. So out in completely empty

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.960
space where the values for all of these
fields are basically zero.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.060
but here's the thing

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.280
it's impossible to make a field
perfectly flat and 0.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.500
You cannot take a quantum field and make it completely quiet.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.380
It's the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.440
It says you can't take a particle
and pinpoint it to exactly zero energy

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.420
likewise you can't take a quantum field
and make it exactly flat everywhere.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.120
Now, this is important because ordinarily
these fluctuations are really really

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.220
tiny and they only affect subatomic
processes but during that period of

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:17.360
inflation the universe expanded in size
so rapidly and so incredibly that those

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.180
tiny fluctuations got blown up to the
scale of the observable universe

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.840
Now, without them we think the matter
distribution in the universe would have

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.700
been completely homogeneous completely
uniform and that means the gravitational

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.970
force on any object in the universe
would have been the same in all

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.530
directions which means nothing would
ever have collapsed into the big

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.549
structures that we see today but thanks
to these fluctuations there were

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.810
slightly denser and less dense regions
and of course the denser regions had

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.950
stronger gravitational fields so they
pulled in the matter from around them

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.269
and that clumped together the matter into
huge gas clouds that would go on to be

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.680
the galaxies that contain the stars and
the planets and the things we know today

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.239
you can actually see the imprint of
these quantum fluctuations in the

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.840
leftover radiation from the Big Bang the
cosmic microwave background radiation

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.470
the quantum fluctuations in the fields
were amplified to big classical fluctuations

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.590
in the density of

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.940
matter from place to place and those
fluctuations in the density of matter show up

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.510
in the universe today as temperature
differences in the cosmic background

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.950
radiation and ultimately in things like
stars and planets and galaxies

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:35.940
I think it is incredible that without these
fluctuations in the vacuum these tiny

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.410
insignificant things that we take for
granted our universe might really

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.990
contain nothing. Nothing of interest
anyway...

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.650
Speaking of vacuum

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.010
this episode was supported in part by Dyson
who sent me their 360 eye vacuuming robot

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.830
it's got this little camera on the top
that can see 360 degrees around it now

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.780
it uses that vision plus some complex
math and trigonometry to work out its

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.260
location precisely and to figure out
where it's cleaned already and where it

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.669
still needs to clean it actually makes a
map that you can see on your phone using

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.110
the dyson app and you can use that app
also to control the vacuum or to

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.639
schedule it even when you're not at home
so I for one welcome robots taking over

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.310
the housework you want to find out more
you can click the link in the

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.789
description so i want to thank Dyson for
supporting me and I want to thank my

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:30.369
patreon supporters and of course you for
watching
