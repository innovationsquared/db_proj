00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.670
Hey Youtube, you said you wanted to talk.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.410
What's up?

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.500
Why do you go around making other people look
stupid?

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.210
What do you mean?

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.500
What's water made of?

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.180
Water.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.850
Hahaha,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.370
What makes water?

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.400
Water.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.660
Ok, what elements does it take to make water?

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.660
H2O

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.660
So what does that mean?

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.720
That it's water.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.420
OK, OK, so that was one example

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.420
Really.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.460
Carbon dioxide, everything emits carbon dioxide,
trees, human beings.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.180
I guess like um animals.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.530
So trees are contributing to the...

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.960
Definitely, but it's yeah, definitely.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:52.469
So trees are I guess the, one of the original
primary sources of, emitters of CO2

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.000
So trees are just like anything else on this
Earth that emits carbon dioxide.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.010
I could do this all day
Enough.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.010
enough.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.010
You know what I think?

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.880
I think you do it to feel superior.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.920
Oh, yeah, maybe that's it.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.900
Maybe I'm just an egotistical jerk who delights
in humiliating other people.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.420
Well that fact certainly hasn't gone unnoticed
by your viewers.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.530
You come across a little condescending in
these interviews.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.800
you basically set up every single question
to make the other people look like idiots

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.800
:/

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.270
this guy is a pretentious douche bag

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.200
I f^&amp;%ing hate this youtube channel.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.630
It makes every single person it interviews
look like a complete retard.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.930
Not everyones a physicist so get the %$^&amp; over
it.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.930
Stop!

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.690
Alright, my viewers don't own me.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.600
Actually, you should have read the T's and
C's more carefully.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.160
By seeing your ads, your viewers do, in fact,
own you.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.160
Aw, man!

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.070
Yeah, now, c'mon -- between you and me -- how
selectively do you have to pick through your

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.960
interviews to make people look that dumb?

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.640
I mean some of them

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.670
If you want to see the complete interviews,
then why don't you click the annotation.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.970
You can judge for yourself.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.810
Did you ever think that the reason I start
with misconceptions is because I wrote my

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.100
PhD on how to design films to teach physics?

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.570
And I found that if you just say the correct
stuff

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.980
Trees get most of their mass from carbon dioxide...

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.729
Yep, pretty much covers it.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.430
Viewers don't actually learn anything -- they
just feel like they're learning and they become

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.849
more confident in the things they thought
beforehand.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.629
So what you're saying is you make people look
stupid so you can teach others -- how noble!

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:22.760
But that's just it!

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.530
I don't think these people are stupid.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.959
There's a difference between being unknowledgeable
and being unintelligent.

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.120
I mean I'm unknowledgeable about lots of stuff.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.709
And science can be hard -- for the particular
reason that it's counterintuitive.

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.379
So I think we should acknowledge what everyone
is thinking, what most people are thinking

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:39.939
and use that as our basis for teaching.

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.629
But if you actually believe that, then why
does your face light up with glee every time

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.409
you hear a misconception?

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.269
Because in that moment I realize that I can
be useful.

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.060
I can help people learn the truth -- and that's
the point of Veritasium -- to help people

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.340
understand the truths of the natural world
and seek the truth in their own lives.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.310
As Richard Feynman said, "The first principle
is that you must not fool yourself -- and

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:17.889
you are the easiest person to fool."

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:19.930
This guy is a pretentious douche bag.
