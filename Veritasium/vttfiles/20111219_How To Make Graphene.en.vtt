00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.110
Picture this: you are thrown into a dingy
room and told "you can't leave until you have

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.700
created the thinnest material known to man."

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.600
Not only that, it must also be the strongest,
the best thermal conductor and as good at

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.939
conducting electricity as copper.

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.890
I know, it sounds hopeless.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.590
But luckily, you know something about nanotechnology.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:39.760
You know, really really tiny devices and materials
that are less than 100 nanometers in size.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.219
Of course I don't have to tell you a nanometer
is a billionth of a meter.

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.940
That's roughly the size of ten atoms.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.520
But how do you create something that tiny?

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.790
It's time to embrace your inner MacGyver.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.530
You're gonna need a pencil, some scotch tape
and a healthy dose of elbow grease.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.290
A pencil contains not lead but graphite, which
consists of sheets of carbon in a hexagonal

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.499
lattice.

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:13.780
When you write, layers of graphite slide off
the tip of the pencil and stick to the paper.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.789
Usually, many layers are stacked on top of
each other but once in a while you get a single

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.969
layer of carbon atoms.

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.689
And this is called "graphene"

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:33.479
In 2004, Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov
created graphene using nothing but graphite

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.490
and scotch tape.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.399
They placed a graphite flake onto the tape,
folded it in two and then cleaved the flake

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:41.549
in half.

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.359
They repeated this procedure a number of times
and then studied the resulting fragments.

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:53.200
To their astonishment they found some of the
pieces were only a single atom thick.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.139
This was particularly unexpected because it
was thought a single layer of graphite would

00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:02.380
not be chemically stable, especially at room
temperature.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.659
Graphene conducts electrons faster than any
other substance at room temperature.

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.069
This is because of the extraordinarily high
quality of the graphene lattice.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.390
Scientists are yet to find a single atom out
of place in graphene.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.909
Since the electrons aren't scattered by defects
in the lattice, they go so fast that Einstein's

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.280
relativity must be used to understand their
motion.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.580
And this perfect lattice is created by the
very strong yet flexible bonds between carbon

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.200
atoms -- making the substance bendable but
harder than diamond.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.390
Graphene in incredibly strong -- if you could
balance an elephant on a pencil and support

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.900
the pencil on graphene, the graphene wouldn't
break.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.230
Of course the pencil would.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.989
For their discovery, Geim and Novoselov were
awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 2010.

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.319
And this is only the beginning for Graphene.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.540
Scientists are hard at work exploiting its
unique properties to create thin, transparent,

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:15.629
flexible touch screens,
Smaller, faster, more energy efficient computers

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:22.010
Tough composite materials
And more efficient solar cells

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.379
And now consider this is only one aspect of
nanotechnology, so in order to think big you

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.560
need first consider the very small.
