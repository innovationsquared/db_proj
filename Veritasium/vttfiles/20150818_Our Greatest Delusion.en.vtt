00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.920
I'm not sure what I expected to find when
I went to Chernobyl. I mean it's been so long

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.390
since the nuclear reactor there melted down
and spewed radioactive atoms across the land.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:23.900
So for almost thirty years this place has
been virtually abandoned. These days workers

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.289
are allowed into the zone but only for two
weeks at a time. And that's not because the

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.870
levels of radiation are too high, it's actually
for psychological reasons. More than two weeks

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.159
in a place like this will apparently make
you think strange things. And I was only here

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:46.360
for four days but I started to think about
rocks.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.620
Yeah... rocks.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.640
Rocks appear to be permanent. I mean I know
that they aren't. Mountains are constantly

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.510
eroding
and in places the crust is melting back into

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:09.280
the mantle. Rock obviously isn't permanent
but on the scale of a human life, it is and

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.480
people recognized that fact - rocks are permanent
- for thousands of years and I think that's

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.630
what makes them important to us. I mean, "a
diamond is forever"

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.270
We build these monuments out of rock because
they will outlast us and virtually every other

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.360
material we can think of. Our modern structures
of metal and glass are just rock refined by

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:42.880
our ingenuity. Rocks are both practical and
symbolic. We seek to indentify ourselves with

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.340
rocks. We carve our heroes in stone because
we want them to last forever and there's a

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.790
way in which we want that kind of permanence
for ourselves too. I think it's in the core

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.080
of the desire to scratch our name into stone,
put your initials in wet cement, really man-made

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.370
rock, or fasten a padlock to a bridge. In
this way we try to push our impermanence from

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.909
our minds. The monuments, statues and bridges,
they give us a sense of continuity, stability.

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:20.519
That this is the way it is and the way it's
always been. Like the way we first we concieved

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:29.060
of stars: static, unchanging, eternal. And
this way of viewing the world helps us maintain

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:38.219
our greatest delusion: the thought that we
are in any way eternal. We want to believe

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:46.590
that some part of us, our consciousness or
our soul will last forever. But what do you

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.769
make of it then when you see stone is not even
so permanent?

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.930
Walking around Chernobyl I think it's understandable
I started contemplating not only the permanence

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.939
of rocks but also their decay, and by extension,
our decay, death, what the world would look

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:05.819
like without people.

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:14.389
You know the closest I can come to imagining
true nothingness is to picture the universe

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:21.079
running really fast in reverse. All the galaxies
squeezing closer together, stars expanding

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.980
back into gas clouds and everything getting
hotter and denser, compactifying until the

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.559
whole observable universe could fit into a
room and then sinking further into a tiny

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:40.900
point and then... nothing. Not the nothingness
of empty space but real nothingess which has

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:49.370
no size and no time. To me that is probably
what death looks like, a nothiness so complete

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:56.260
you wouldn't even miss it. For that, you'd
have to be there. But just as soon as I can

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.870
form this thought, it evaporates like a void
in nature. The world rushes in to fill it.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.129
And this make sense because the hardware I'm
running has been developed over billions of

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:12.489
years with the only requriement being that
it frequently and accurately makes copies

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.709
of itself and it would help not in the slightest
in the goal of making copies if the hardware

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:24.940
could accurately simulate its own non-existence.
When we do acknowledge our impermanence, it

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:32.060
is often through insipid catch phrases like
"yolo" or it's in art projects like Damien

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.130
Hirst's "The physical impossibility of death
in the mind of someone living", which is just

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.040
a huge shark in a tank of formaldehyde. A
sense of our mortality should strike fear

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.880
into us, like the sense I have when I'm swimming
hundreds of meters off shore and the water

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:57.420
below is deep and dark and I can picture the
shark swimming beneath me. The same kind of

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:05.730
fate stalks us daily but not in this visceral
way, just in trivial ignorable way. Hence

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:13.380
the delusion. You're permanent like stone,
always were and always will be. So we are

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:20.440
left hardwired for denial, a selected inability
to imagine true nothingness, an ephemeral

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:27.730
sack of particles that thinks itself
eternal. This delusion is comforting and it

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.840
makes living easier. It might drive you crazy
to be confronted with the ultimate meaninglessness

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:41.950
of everything all the time, what we call nihilism.
But the same delusion I'd argue is also debilitating.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.900
It lulls you into a false sense of security,
inaction, like a due date a long time in the

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:55.240
future. There's always tomorrow so we procrastinate
living the life we truly desire and we live

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:02.150
in more fear. The sense that your soul is
eternal makes you cowardly because failure

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:10.520
would stick with you forever. For really ever.
Shame, embarassment, disappointment, they

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.050
would never leave you. A distant horizon encourages
you to play it safe. Live to fight another

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:26.580
day, for after all there is always another
day. And this is why I find nihilism liberating

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.310
and emboldening. If you can really picture
the nothingess that awaits you then what is

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:40.280
there to be afraid of? Errors and humiliations
will be forgotten but great achiements may

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:47.110
not. We may have no meaning in the cosmic
context of the universe but we make our own

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:53.180
meaning daily with each other and this is
the thought that leads to action: your days

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.330
are numbered, you don't know what that number
is but it's finite, so get busy with what

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.310
it is you want to do. Time is running out.
