00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.500
almost eight years ago when this channel
was fresh and before I had gray hairs in

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.660
my beard in fact before I had a beard I
made a video showing that if you take a

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.340
grape and cut it almost completely in
half and put it in the microwave you can

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.200
make some plasma

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.380
but the explanation we
had in that video was lacking this was

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.980
me and my friend Dr. Stephen Bosi a
fellow physicist so you should look

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.059
forward to that on another episode of
veritasium to be honest nobody really

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.390
knew how this effect worked that is
until now as of the publication of this

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.440
video three scientists have published an
explanation in the Proceedings of the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.010
National Academy of Sciences
they studied this effect with high-speed

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.449
cameras thermal cameras electromagnetic
modeling and they came up with an

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.989
explanation that I think is pretty
satisfying and it extends way beyond

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.539
just microwave great plasma so naturally
I called up these scientists yeah

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.519
actually saw your video before that your
videos before joining the grape project

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.310
oh really
that's why I was like already kind of

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.000
like interested before joining the
project the scientists showed you don't

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.710
even need to use a grape you can get the
same effect with hydrogel water beads

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.490
these are those tiny polymer beads which
when you soak in water they increase in

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.140
volume like 100 times

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.820
to understand how microwaving a grape
gives you plasma we first need to know a

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.530
few things like a typical household
microwave uses a frequency of

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.570
electromagnetic radiation at about two
point four five gigahertz that means

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.509
that the wavelength of microwaves inside
the oven is about twelve centimeters

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.050
long. now if you've ever studied
electromagnetic radiation you might have

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.490
the intuition that interesting things
start to happen when the object or

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.039
obstacle is around the same size as the
wavelength which a grape certainly is not

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.679
it's not twelve centimeters but the
important quantity is how big is the

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.890
wavelength inside the object inside the
grape twelve centimeters in air but the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.180
like index of refraction of grape
material must be close to like one point

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.170
three three or something right like at
visible wavelengths it is a lot lower

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.810
but in the microwave regime the index of
refraction is a almost 10 so you have a

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.250
much higher index of refraction so
microwaves are traveling you know like

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.299
ten times slower through the grape than
they are through yet air yes and that

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.530
means that the wavelength is a tenth its
size through air so instead of twelve

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.950
centimeters it's about 1.2 centimeters
right about the size of a grape now if

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.000
you take a single grape and place it
inside the microwave don't cut it in

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.110
half what you find is that the
microwaves actually become trapped

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.060
inside the grape and that's because of
its high refractive index and its size

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.680
because turns out that when you have
like a ball where approximately the

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.420
diameter is roughly the same as the wavelength
of the microwaves in the material. It

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.799
actually turns out that it can be trapped
in there so that it interacts its kind...

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.930
it's kind of it bounces at the borders
of the of the ball and it can't get out

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.540
is it like total internal reflection? yes
pretty much wow that's interesting I

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.140
hadn't thought of it that way
so the microwaves become trapped inside

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.820
the grape and they actually form these
resonant modes you can think of them as

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.660
standing waves just ways in which the
electromagnetic fields like to

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.130
oscillate inside a grape such that the
maximum electromagnetic field is

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.360
actually in the center of the grape when
you put in the microwave you see that it

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.170
heats up not from the outside in like
you would expect if it was just

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.670
absorbing the microwaves but rather from
the inside out. if you add a second grape

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.940
to the microwave you see that the same
thing happens the microwaves get trapped

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.780
in the second grape too- and the amplitude
is highest in the very center of the

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.450
grape and so the heating occurs most of
all of there. but if you move these two

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.340
grapes close together so they're closer
than say a wavelength well then you can

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.700
start to get interactions between the
electromagnetic fields in the one grape

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.290
and in the other and in fact if you get
the grapes touching then the greatest

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.600
electromagnetic field actually occurs at
that contact point between the two

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.070
grapes and so that is where you're gonna
get the greatest oscillating

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.010
electromagnetic fields and that is where
those grapes are going to get hottest

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.580
it's also interesting that you don't
need to cut the grapes in half. two

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.500
grapes placed side-by-side will make
this effect work as long as they stay in

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.240
contact. but that's why in a lot of the
videos you see there's a watch glass so

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.540
the reason the watch glass is
there is to keep the grapes together now

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.780
with the very strong electromagnetic
fields at the intersection of the two

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.300
grapes what you can get is some sparks
some breakdown of air that is the

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.020
electric fields are strong enough that
they ionize the air creating those

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.240
Sparks and that is what leads to the
plasma it creates these ions which can

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.090
then receive more energy from the
microwaves. you can see it here pulsing

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.940
at 120 Hertz that's twice the 60 Hertz
frequency of mains power which reflects

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.140
the fact that the amplitude of the
microwaves is pulsing twice every cycle

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:33.070
and what is that plasma made of? well the
scientists looked at the spectrum of the

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.600
plasma from a grape and they found that
there's a strong potassium emission line

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.420
and also a sodium emission line so it
seems like those ions must be pretty

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.660
common in the grape and when the plasma
gets formed as those ions which are

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.620
sprayed up into the air and that is what
we're seeing

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.600
who needs drugs?! now the size of the
grapes is important which is something I

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.900
of course suspected because you don't
see this happening with too many other

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:05.290
squishy fruits but you don't have to get
them the exact right size and this is

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:11.860
because water absorbs microwaves so the
scientists did some modeling of this and

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.139
if you had a material inside the grape
that did not absorb microwaves then what

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:22.630
you would see is at certain particular
sizes you get extreme amplification of

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.350
the electromagnetic fields it's
basically one size that you'd have to

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:31.960
hit to get the amplification but made of
an absorbent material like water this

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.190
broadens out the peaks so you get less
amplification of the field but over a

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.050
broader range of sizes this is why a lot
of grapes will work even if the sizes

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.870
vary. so in terms of like applications of
this research what do you think I mean

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:52.780
obviously people like me are excited and
because this is a fun trick but but

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.440
beyond that what do you think in terms
of like applications of this? the main

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.300
limit in fabricating microchips right
now and going smaller and smaller is the

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:06.130
lithography so how to make these very
small features. this phenomenon shows

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.940
that two spheres of the right size and
refractive index can focus

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:15.039
electromagnetic energy down to a tiny
spot in between them in this case down

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:20.050
to around a millimeter from radiation
with a 12 centimeter wave length if

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.889
similar focusing could be achieved with
light it would provide a significant

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:29.289
improvement over current lithography
techniques. So if we could somehow harness

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:33.070
this to do this lithography to be able
to maybe write things very small you

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.150
could actually use light to to make
really small features you could do like

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.979
every two nanometers marks spot
with about 2 nanometers resolution - it would help

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:46.630
help continue this like Moore's Law yes
it would help continue Moore's Law like

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:54.099
putting much more small things in a single
chip so I'm glad I was finally able to

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:59.289
explain how this effect works did you
enjoy it do you feel like you get it any

00:07:59.289 --> 00:08:01.700
questions
put them in the comments below also I

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.660
really like this video that I made this
is my previous video and so if you

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.330
haven't seen it go check it out
I'll also put a link to the original

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:13.430
grape video which is maybe not that good
cuz it was eight years ago but anyway

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.600
thanks for watching
