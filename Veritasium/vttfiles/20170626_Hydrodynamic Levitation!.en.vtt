Check this out

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:08.309
Hahaha, isn't that awesome? That is hydrodynamic levitation

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.570
Check it out!

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.569
This styrofoam ball is levitating on this stream of water

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.789
And it's doing so in a very stable way. The set up it's so stable you can play Frisbee through it

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.098
Which is weird to me because the water is off to one side of the ball

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.168
And that doesn't seem to make any sense, cause you can block the water for a second and the ball will still levitate, have a look

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.530
Isn't that cool?

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.660
How can it be stable like this? How can this be a stable configuration?

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.020
That is what we're gonna explain

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:05.610
This is my friend Blake

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.959
He is a toy inventor, and he actually came up with this and he brought it to me

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.400
And I was like "That is awesome, there's some really cool physics going on here."

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.100
Juggling with water. I can't believe it will

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.739
just allow you to switch balls like that. They can even hit each other as they go down

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.159
It doesn't take the other one off the stream. So how does this effect work?

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.260
Well a lot of people might think of the hairdryer ping-pong ball effect. Which works basically based on Bernoulli's principle

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.130
That's actually what we're showing here

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.430
We've brought this stream down so it's going at a very low velocity

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.840
So it's pretty much laminar flow, and what you can see, if you look at the ball, is it's entirely

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.900
enclosed in water, so that water stream comes up, goes around the ball and

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.299
just as with the ping-pong ball

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.420
If it moves to one side of the stream it slows down the flow of fluid, and according to Bernoulli's principle

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.400
This increases the pressure relative to the faster flowing fluid on the other side

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.430
So it pushes the ball back into the middle. That is what provides the stability for this ball.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.000
But I think what we're seeing with the bigger balls is something different.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.219
This is the largest styrofoam ball I could find, so I don't expect it to work, but hey we're gonna give it a shot

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.280
Should I go higher?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.280
Oh!

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.920
It's happening!

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.780
That is incredible! Look at it dance on there man!

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.420
It's like got this instability, but it corrects. It's incredible! You should see the way the water is spiraling off there

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.110
That is awesome!

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.380
So I've been thinking a lot about the physics that makes this possible

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.440
What I think is happening is as the stream contacts the ball

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.090
It pushes it up, but it also pushes the ball out, away from the stream

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.460
so what I think is remarkable is that the ball actually will stay there. It is in a stable configuration and

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:27.400
From looking at the high-speed footage what I really think is going on is this water is getting thrown over and down by the ball

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.320
and since the ball is putting a force over and down on the water that water is putting a force up and in on the ball

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.320
which keeps it right in that stream

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.580
It's because there's a bit of adhesion between the water here and the styrofoam. Starts to go a little slower

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.720
That pulls all that water over the ball

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.629
And that's the start of how you get the ball to spin

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:53.639
And how you get that sprayed down on the right-hand side which provides more lift and keeps forcing the ball back into the stream

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.460
Come on

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:04.439
once the ball is levitating it remains stable because if it drifts too far into the stream that decreases the flow of water around the

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.929
Ball reducing the force pushing it into the stream

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.770
And if it drifts too far out that increases the water flow over the ball increasing the force pushing it back into the stream

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:21.210
That's what makes the equilibrium position so stable. Any slight perturbation creates a restoring force that moves the ball back to equilibrium

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.780
The rotation I think is also nice because that gives it that angular momentum

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.300
Providing a little bit of stability side by side, that's not so important for these balls

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:38.440
But it certainly is important for the disc. If you try to levitate a disc you need to keep it in the right orientation

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.020
Oh, yes!

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.800
Getting the discs to levitate is significantly harder than the balls because they have to maintain their vertical orientation

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.660
In order for this to work. Even a slight breeze makes this very difficult

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.000
HEY! Check that out! Can you come in and get it?

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.420
Oh my goodness

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.680
This is a clear demonstration

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:27.508
that that is not just about the Bernoulli effect, right? It's due to the rotation of the disc that actually carries the water

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:32.969
over and sprays it down which pushes that back into the stream. That's amazing

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:36.029
Not only is this an awesome experiment

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:40.360
it's also pretty fun to play around with in the summer, and it was invented by my friend Blake

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.320
So come over my channel Innovinci

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.280
and I'll show you how, with a simple Home Depot run, you can build this in your own backyard

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.820
I'll put a link to that video right here. So if you want to make this, go check it out
