00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:07.370
A classical computer performs operations using
classical bits, which can be either zero or

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.370
one.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.850
Now in contrast, a quantum computer users
quantum bits or qubits.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.440
And they can be both zero and one at the same
time.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.179
And it is this that gives a quantum computer
its superior computing power.

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.560
There are a number of physical objects that
can be used as a qubit.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.589
A single photon, a nucleus or an electron.

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.750
I met up with researchers who were using the
outermost electron in phosphorous as a qubit.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.120
But how does that work?

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.690
Well, all electrons have magnetic fields,
so they are basically like tiny bar magnets.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.070
And this property is called spin.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.890
If you place them in a magnetic field they
will align with that field, just like a compass

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.680
needle lines up with the magnetic field of
the earth.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.760
Now this is the lowest energy state, so you
could call it the zero state or we call it

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.000
for the electron, spin down.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.710
Now you can put it in a one state, or spin
up, but that takes some energy.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.970
&gt;&gt; If you took out the glass from your compass
you could turn the needle the other way, but

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.000
you would have to apply some force to it.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.110
You have to push it to flip to the other side.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.320
And that is the highest energy state.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.500
In principle, if you were so delicate to really
put it exactly against the magnetic field,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.850
it would stay there.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.310
&gt;&gt; Now so far this is basically just like
a classical bit.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.690
It has got two states, spin up and spin down,
which are like the classical one and zero.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.280
But the funny thing about quantum objects
is that thy can be in both states at once.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.990
Now when you measure the spin it will be either
up or down.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.920
But before you measure it, the electron can
exist in what is called a quantum super position,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.979
where these coefficients indicate the relative
probability of finding the electron in one

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.500
state or the other.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.870
Now it is hard to imagine how this enables
this incredible computing power of quantum

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.090
computers without considering two interacting
quantum bits.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.090
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.090
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.280
Now there are four possible states of these
two electrons.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.030
&gt;&gt; You could think that, well, that is just
like two bits of a classical computer, right?

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.660
If you have two bits you can write zero, zero;
zero, one; one, zero; one, one.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.660
Right?

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.050
There is four numbers.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.680
But these are still just two bits of information.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.680
Right?

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.930
All I need to say to determine which one of
the four numbers you have in your computer

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.980
code is the value of the first bit and the
value of the second bit.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:39.830
Here, instead, quantum mechanics allows me
to make super position of each one of these

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.630
four states.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.260
So I can write a quantum mechanical state,
which is perfectly legitimate, that is some

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.150
coefficient times this plus some coefficient
times that plus some coefficient times that

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.069
plus some coefficient times that.

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:01.620
So determine the state of this two spin system,
I need to give you four numbers, four coefficients,

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.879
whereas in the classical example of the two
bits, I only need to give you two bits.

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:13.989
So this is how you understand why two qubits
actually contain four bits of information.

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.230
I need to give you four numbers to tell you
the state of this system, whereas here I only

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.230
need two.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.550
Now if we make three spins, we would have
eight different states and it could give you

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.011
eight different numbers to define the state
of those three spins, whereas classical it

00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:31.410
is just three bits.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.480
If you keep going, what you find is that the
amount of equivalent classical information

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:45.000
contained by N qubits is two to the power
N classical bits.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.550
And, of course, the power of exponentials
tells you that once you have, let’s say,

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:01.459
300 of those qubits in what we call the folient
angle state, so you must be able to create

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.099
these really crazy states where there is a
super position of all three angles being one

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:12.629
way and another way and another way and so
on, then you have like two to the 300 classical

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.309
bits, which is as many particles as there
are in the universe.

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:22.570
&gt;&gt; But there is a catch, although the qubits
can exist in any combination of states, when

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.780
they are measured they must fall into one
of the basis states.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.620
And all the other information about the state
before the measurement is lost.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:36.370
&gt;&gt; So you don’t want generally to have as
the final result of your quantum computation

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.400
something that is a very complicated super
positional state, because our cannot measure

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.400
a super position.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.979
You can only measure one of these basis states.

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.759
&gt;&gt; Like down, down, up, up.

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:48.759
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:57.160
So what you want is to design the logical
operations that you need to get to the final

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.820
computational result in such a way that the
final result is something you are able to

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.590
measure, just a unique state.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.789
&gt;&gt; That is not trivial.

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:07.880
&gt;&gt; That is not trivial.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:14.070
And it is essentially ... I am kind of stretching
things, but I guess it is to some degree the

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.910
reason why quantum computers are not a replacement
of classical computers.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:19.910
&gt;&gt; They are not.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:20.910
&gt;&gt; No, they are not.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.060
They are not universally faster.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:30.680
They are only faster for special types of
calculations where you can use the fact that

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.560
you have all these quantum super positions
available to you at the same time, to do some

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.949
kind of computational parallelism.

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:44.919
If you just want to watch a video in high
definition or browse the internet or write

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:51.800
some documenting work, they are not going
to give you any particular improvement if

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.650
you need to use a classical algorithm to get
the result.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.520
So you should not think of a quantum computer
as something where every operation is faster.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.270
In fact, every operation is probably going
to be slower than in the computer you have

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.270
at your desk.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:15.169
But it is a computer where the number of operations
required to arrive at the result is exponentially

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:16.440
small.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.639
So the improvement is not in the speed of
the individual operation.

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.270
It is in the total number of operations you
need to arrive at the result.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.789
But that is only the case in particular types
of calculations, particular algorithms.

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:46.230
It is not universally, which is why it is
not a replacement of a classical computer.
