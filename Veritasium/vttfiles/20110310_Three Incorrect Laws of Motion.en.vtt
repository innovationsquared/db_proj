00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:11.940
Nearly 350 years ago, Isaac Newton came up with three laws of motion that govern how everything moves.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.960
There are three pretty famous laws of motion.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.700
And they're not very complicated, but if I told them to you as clearly as I can,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.940
You would think that you're understanding them, but I think you wouldn't.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.160
And the reason is, everyone has ideas about physics and how objects move,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.840
Before they're ever taught anything in, uh, a science classroom.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.880
So rather than tell you Newton's Three Laws of Motion, I like to tell you

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.220
Derek's Three Incorrect Laws of Motion, which are the ones I think you're actually thinking.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.320
So, Derek's First Incorrect Law of Motion is...

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.080
An object with no unbalanced forces on it will naturally come to rest.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.960
[Cup sliding]

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.000
[Books falling]

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.040
[Door slamming]

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.020
[Coin spinning and falling]

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.360
Derek's Second Incorrect Law of Motion is that an unbalanced force causes

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.360
An object to move with a constant velocity

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.600
We could express this in an equation.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.040
Where the unbalanced force, F, equals the mass (M)

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.500
times the velocity (V)

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.000
So, if you double the force, the velocity also doubles.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.320
It's just like being in a car.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.840
As you press on the accelerator, you increase the force on the car,

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.420
and therefore, you move to a new, higher constant speed.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.540
Derek's Third Incorrect Law of Motion is that

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.680
Larger objects apply larger forces to smaller objects.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.260
When a large truck slams into a car on the highway,

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.700
The force of the truck on the car is much greater than the force of the car back on the truck.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.580
Or you think about the Earth and the Moon.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.760
The force with which the Earth attracts the Moon is greater than the force with which the Moon attracts the Earth.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.940
But remember, this is an incorrect law of motion.
