- Part of this video was
sponsored by Google Domains.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.790
This is a US government warehouse

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.280
that sells almost
anything you can imagine.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.990
Blueberries, steel, cigarettes,
limestone, a standard bullet

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.630
and even some things you
don't want to imagine.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.123
I also see you have domestic sludge there.

00:00:19.123 --> 00:00:20.070
(Dr.Place laughs)

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.500
This is domestic sludge.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.960
- So, when you flush your toilet

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.420
and it goes through the sewer

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.580
and it goes into a
wastewater treatment plant,

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.670
the first step is to get rid
of all the solid material.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.523
We took that, dried it down,
so it's a nice fine powder.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.700
I wouldn't recommend smelling it.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.010
- What is the purpose of all this stuff?

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.103
Why are they selling it
and why is it so expensive?

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.490
Does it ever feel like you're
living inside a sci-fi story

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.323
or something?

00:00:51.323 --> 00:00:52.830
- [Dr. Choquette] You know,
I've been here for a long time,

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.050
so I don't think it from that perspective,

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.610
but I should say yes.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.440
- [Derek] The science
fiction element to me

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.900
is like there's someone
thinking about that?

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.733
- Yeah.

00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:02.730
- There's someone collecting that?

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.710
It seems so fictional.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.710
Like why should a place like this exist?

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.250
There are apple leaves and
peach leaves, oyster tissue,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.850
bars of zinc metal, carbon
dioxide in nitrogen.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.680
In these vats of liquid nitrogen,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.140
there are samples of marine animals.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.200
- Mussel samples, dolphin
samples, whale samples.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.950
Birds as well, bird tissue

00:01:25.248 --> 00:01:28.593
And some human tissue as well.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.440
- [Derek] But perhaps the
weirdest thing they sell

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.273
is something really mundane.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.343
Peanut butter.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.100
- It looks like a peanut butter.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.940
It is peanut butter.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.780
It's creamy.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.760
- [Derek] It's probably
the most expensive jar

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.980
of peanut butter in the whole world.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.930
- Well, we essentially
pay for a company to make

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.190
generic peanut butter.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.220
We might have 2000 jars
of generic peanut butter.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.140
And what we do is we then go through

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.790
and measure the fats in these jars

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.150
and figure out how much of
various compounds are in there.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.980
And we actually then slap on a label

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.200
and provide a certificate at the end.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.080
- Have you ever eaten some
of this peanut butter?

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.820
- All of these things are
not for human consumption

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.260
because I don't know if
I could actually tell you

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.570
how old it is, but it's old enough

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.640
that you probably don't want to eat it.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.810
- How much does it cost?

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.940
- These are not sold at
commercial grade prices.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.050
So, this jar of peanut
butter is not $3.99 cents.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.080
This jar, I believe, is
around a thousand dollars.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.640
This is not something that
would be viable for you

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.550
to make your peanut butter
and jelly sandwich with.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.290
- [Derek] An ordinary jar of peanut butter

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.270
costs less than $5.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.430
And on the label you
can see the ingredients

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.990
and the amounts of different nutrients

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.200
like protein, fats, sugar, and sodium.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.630
Those values have been
measured by the manufacturer

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.900
using different machines
and analytical techniques.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.990
But how do you know those
results are accurate?

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.610
Well, this is where the government's

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.280
standard jar of peanut butter comes in.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.980
It is mixed up so carefully and thoroughly

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.190
that each jar contains
exactly the same substance.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.740
- We take great pains at
homogenizing these things.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.420
Make sure it's consistent.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.320
- [Derek] Then scientists

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.680
at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology, NIST,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.160
take years to painstakingly
identify the quantities

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.950
of all the different
compounds in the peanut butter

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.560
with specified uncertainties.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.420
This peanut butter is then known

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.320
as a standard reference material or SRM.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.930
They sell these perfectly characterized

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.840
SRM samples of peanut
butter to researchers

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.350
and manufacturers so they can
calibrate their equipment.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.420
Essentially, the buyer
knows that their equipment

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.280
is working properly if,

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.230
when they run the standard peanut butter,

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.650
they get the values NIST
supplies on the certificate.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.730
- We've spent a lot of time

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.920
to make sure that we're
confident and, you know,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.100
we can spend years studying
the amount of fat in here

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.710
and trying to figure out
exactly what those numbers are.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.300
- [Derek] So what you're paying for

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.400
is not really the peanut butter,

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.600
it's the knowledge of exactly
what is in the peanut butter.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.930
- And so this is what
really drives the cost

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.000
of a standard reference material

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.790
is our ability to assert the truth.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.840
We produce what I call truth in a bottle.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.290
- You might think, why does it matter

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.360
that the label on my
peanut butter is accurate?

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.550
But it is way more than
the things on the label

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.783
that NIST measures.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.980
Peanut butter actually
contains naturally occurring

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.180
aflatoxins.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.850
They're are carcinogen
which can cause liver cancer

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.060
and they're produced by
fungi on the peanuts.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.890
So if your peanut butter is made from

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.500
a bad batch of peanuts,
you want the factory

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.360
to be able to accurately detect

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.718
elevated levels of aflatoxins.

00:04:32.718 --> 00:04:33.630
And they're able to do that

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.090
because the standard
peanut butter contains

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.610
a known level of
aflatoxin that can be used

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.470
to calibrate their equipment.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.790
Will the FDA like sample peanut butters

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.110
and look for aflatoxin?

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.510
- A lot of times you actually
have commercial laboratories

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.490
that measure it in accordance to the FDA.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.250
The FDA may encourage them
to use a reference material,

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.420
standard reference material,

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.040
to make sure they're
getting the right numbers.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.963
FDA may not be handling it themselves.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.930
- [Derek] There are different challenges

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.330
to measuring the components
of different foods.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.650
Fine powder, for example,

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.980
is easier to characterize
than goopy peanut butter.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.500
So it's helpful to have
a standard material

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.750
that closely matches the target

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.330
in composition and consistency,

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.180
but it's also impossible
for NIST to characterize

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.860
every different type of food.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.290
- We're not gonna make a trout and a perch

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.910
and salmon material,

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.655
all these different,
with the same numbers.

00:05:25.655 --> 00:05:29.040
We're kind of grab an average
fish and kind of treat that.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.420
So if you're measuring it in other fish,

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.070
you can usually use it as a surrogate.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.690
- [Derek] So you have a standard trout?

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.550
- [Dr. Place] Correct, yes.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.848
- [Derek] Tell me about Meat Homogenate.

00:05:37.848 --> 00:05:38.681
(Dr. Place laughs)

00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:42.420
- It is a mixed meat product
that has been mixed thoroughly,

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.280
been ground into a very fine particle,

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.260
and packed into a very nice tin.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.740
- Why do you mix like chicken and pork?

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.390
Why not just have like
a chicken reference,

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.470
a pork reference?

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.000
- We never do this by ourselves.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.867
We always work with these
industry companies and say,

00:05:55.867 --> 00:05:57.870
"Hey what kind of mixes do you need?"

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.170
And then we request that kind
of material to be blended

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.480
- [Derek] For a reference
material to be useful,

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.490
It doesn't have to be the exact material

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.470
a manufacturer wants to characterize.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.630
It just has to be close enough.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.150
NIST sells around 30 different food items

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.030
that are spread around
their food triangle.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.350
At the corners of the triangle

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.820
are a 100% carbohydrate, a
100% fat, and a 100% protein.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.120
So, based on their mix of
these three macro ingredients,

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.760
all foods fall somewhere on this triangle.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.310
And to characterize each
one, you would want to use

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.590
the closest standard reference material.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.380
- If you're trying to do
your measurements and tell,

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.200
you know, a regulatory authority
that I'm making, you know,

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.700
a food that's a kibble,

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.380
but I'm measuring it
against peanut butter,

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.213
they're gonna be saying,

00:06:41.213 --> 00:06:42.046
"Well, that peanut butter

00:06:42.046 --> 00:06:43.740
has a wildly different fat content."

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.850
So what we wanna give them

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.940
is something, a matrix, that
looks as much as possible

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.800
as what they're used to dealing with.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.100
- [Derek] They even have
a standard diet mix.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.230
- This is called typical diet.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.390
Through surveys, they identified
what the average American

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:02.340
eats and they purchased it
all and they blended it all up

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.520
and then they freeze dried
it into a nice fine powder.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.490
It's like a light gray
powder and this represents

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:09.720
all the nutritional components

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.520
that an average American would consume.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.710
So it represents the sugar content,

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.870
it represents the proteins
that you might have,

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.190
any vitamins you might have,

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.680
any fats you might have
is all in a little jar

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.063
that we puree up.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.080
- [Derek] In total, NIST has nearly 1300

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.093
standard reference materials.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.720
- This is our warehouse.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.320
And so it's an approximately
20,000 square foot warehouse

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.440
in which we store all of
our inventory, our products,

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.273
the SRMs.

00:07:38.273 --> 00:07:39.720
And so we are a business.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.850
And so, what excites me about this,

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.070
being on the technical
side, is that I get to run

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.410
a 20 million business within
the federal government.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.960
We sell about 30,000 units a year.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.450
So each order is about three units.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.950
Half of them are sold domestically

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.260
and half are sold to an
international audience.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.270
- You can see all the
prices on on our website.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:01.620
So it's shop.nist.gov is
the e-commerce storefront

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.850
for all these materials.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:04.020
You can search for whatever you want.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.070
You can search for peanut butter,

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.720
you can search for meat homogenate.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.490
- [Derek] If I like
had a thousand dollars,

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:09.870
would you sell that to me?

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:13.110
- There is some control to who we sell to.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.870
- I feel like this is
unfair like I'm a scientist.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.910
If I got a thousand bucks.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.070
NIST won't sell to just anyone,

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.290
but there are plenty of websites that do.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.110
And this part of the video is
sponsored by Google Domains.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.390
The easiest way to set
up an online business.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.580
I have a shop where I
sell a product I invented

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.690
called Snatoms.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.160
It's a molecular modeling kit

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.740
where the atoms snap
together magnetically.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.650
You know, when I came up with
the name Snatoms back in 2015,

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.260
the first step was to
check if the domain name

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.820
snatoms.com was available.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.490
If you have a good idea, you
should claim that domain name

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.810
as soon as you can.

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:48.180
It's like claiming a social media handle.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.760
And Google Domains makes this easy.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.160
I moved snatoms.com over to Google Domains

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.050
in just five minutes.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.850
If you're building an
online store from scratch,

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.680
you can set up your whole website quickly

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.140
using Google Domains
simple templates and tools.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.000
No coding required.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.460
Now, with snatoms.com
set up on Google Domains,

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.680
I never have to worry about reliability.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.920
It runs on Google Cloud's super
fast DNS infrastructure,

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.780
So the domain resolves lightning fast,

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.520
no matter where in the world,

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.690
your users are.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.520
I also get peace of mind
from Google Domain's

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.830
security features, like
built in privacy protection

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.780
and two factor authentication.

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.640
Plus it automatically connects to tools

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.800
like Google Workspace or Google Analytics

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.050
to help me understand
and build the business.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.750
So claim your own domain
name with Google Domains

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.090
starting at just $12 a year.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.470
Go to domains.google/veritasium
to get 20% off

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:38.490
your first year.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.980
I will put that link
down in the description.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.450
So thanks to Google Domains

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.463
for sponsoring this part of the video.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.203
But it's not just food
you need standards for.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.820
- In the early 19 hundreds, like 1905,

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.090
there was a huge issue
with the quality of steel

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.220
that was being used in rail cars,

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.680
both locomotives and on the tracks.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.540
It was that they knew
what they had to have

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.340
in the alloys to make it work.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.200
It's just that all the
foundries that were making 'em

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.930
had no way to compare their
results of the material

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.970
they were making to
what every other chemist

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.560
knew they should be making.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.480
And so Congress basically said

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.130
to National Bureau of
Standards at the time,

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.920
we need you to come up with
standard samples of steel

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.970
so that everyone can be on the same page.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.250
And so what we did was we
made these standard steels,

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.290
analyzed them for all
their constituent parts,

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.390
so all the elements, the chrome, the iron,

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:34.320
the hydrogen carbon and
then distributed that

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.270
to the stakeholders, again the foundries,

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.030
so that they can inter compare
and compare their results

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.700
to a known source of steel.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.880
And those were our very first
products that we produced.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.010
- [Derek] Steel is still
one of the most important

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:48.603
SRMs at NIST.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.370
What's your best selling product?

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.950
- Ah, those are called Charpies.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:56.880
- Charpies?
- Yeah.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.470
Okay, let's go look at a Charpie.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:01.770
If you wanna test how strong your steel is

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.890
what Professor Charpy,
Mr.Charpy, came up with

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:08.880
was a test where he set up a pendulum

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.560
and at the end of a pendulum is a weight.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.110
And if you pull that pendulum
up to a certain distance,

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.810
you can calculate it's potential energy.

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.900
At the bottom of the
swing of this pendulum,

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.180
the arc, is a vice.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:26.180
And in the vice, is held
a standard piece of metal

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.110
called a Charpy.

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:29.547
And this has a little V-notch in it.

00:11:29.547 --> 00:11:33.030
And so the idea is that
the pendulum comes through

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.760
and breaks this thing and then
it goes up on the other side.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.040
And from that you can then
calculate the amount of energy

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.230
that it took to break this piece of steel.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:42.510
Every company in the
United States and, frankly,

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:46.140
internationally, now has
to check their materials

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.000
against our Charpies annually

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.190
because the kind of steels they're making

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.800
are used in pipelines or they're
used in defense industries,

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.100
you know, for tanks, for things
that store nuclear waste.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.060
So I have a joke.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.640
I love things that break or
burn and these things break

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.440
and they have to break
and they can't reuse 'em.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.120
So we sell a lot.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.950
- How many would you sell in a year?

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:06.930
- We sell of those, of
all the different kinds,

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.360
we sell about 8,000.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.680
- [Derek] Woah.
- Yeah.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.120
- [Derek] NIST has been making these

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.540
standard reference materials
for over a century.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.790
- This is what our very
first standard sample

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:18.840
number one looks like.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:23.190
It is the real deal and it's
gray powder, it's limestone.

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:28.190
We are still making limestone
number one for 110 years.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:29.970
And it is still so popular

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.880
that we sell 40 to 50
units a year of this.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.170
- [Derek] Huh.
- Isn't that wild?

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.480
Very few companies are in
existence that are still selling

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.613
some of their original products and we do.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.630
- [Derek] Most of the SRMs
we've discussed so far

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.250
are used for calibration.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:47.730
But there's another class
of SRMs used for validation.

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:50.490
This means they're used
directly in industry tests

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:52.140
to ensure consistency.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.660
An example is cigarettes.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.730
- Evidently, smoking in
bed was a real issue.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.520
You know, people were
like catching on fire.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.010
And so there was a lot of regulation

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:05.790
as to how materials in your
mattress or in your sheets

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:09.480
or your bed clothes should
react to a combustible source.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.840
And we produced some standard cigarettes

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.950
that, essentially, along
with the ASTM tests,

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:20.160
would help a manufacturer
determine how flammable

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.240
their furniture was or their
bed clothes or their mattress.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.490
- [Derek] And for those
tests to be consistent,

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:28.170
the fires must be started

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.216
with a standardized NIST cigarette.

00:13:31.216 --> 00:13:32.049
(siren blaring)

00:13:32.049 --> 00:13:33.660
Fires started by smoking materials

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.150
are the leading cause of
death by fire in the home

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.470
in the US.

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.840
- Products like this, but
also with the regulations

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.930
that were in place and just
the educational campaigns

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:46.140
that went on have saved many, many lives.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.730
- [Derek] But they also
have standards for things

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.133
you would never expect,
like a standard bullet.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.090
- When a bullet is fired
through a gun, you know,

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:58.020
the rifling in the barrel
imparts marks to the bullet.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.940
- [Derek] Forensic labs
then have to measure

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.070
these grooves to match the
bullet from the crime scene

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:04.530
to others fired by the suspected weapon.

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:05.520
But how do you know

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.040
they are accurately measuring the grooves?

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.730
- So this has standard marks on it.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.350
They replicated a bullet.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:16.170
Putting, I believe, essentially,
nano-indentations on it.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.200
So very, very fine marks and
mapped it on this bullet.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.900
They weren't fired through a
gun, they were manufactured.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.310
- [Derek] So, to validate their equipment,

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.260
forensic labs can run the standard bullet

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.870
at the same time as a
bullet from a crime scene,

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.183
so they know their
measurements are accurate.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.410
The goal of every standard

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.600
is to quantify something about the world,

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.993
something important that's
usually pretty hard to measure,

00:14:39.993 --> 00:14:42.900
(vacuuming noise)
like house dust.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.890
- In the early nineties, we
worked with maid services

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.870
and we got vacuum bags.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:50.760
We went to hotels, went to motels,

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.160
took all the vacuum bags that
we got from all these hotels

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.310
and houses and everything,
mixed it together in a big pot,

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.590
so it's fully mixed, so every little jar

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:00.090
has the same number of chemicals,

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:01.620
has the same amount of material in it.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.900
And then we measured everything in there.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.090
And the reason why I
find dust is interesting

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:08.280
is 'cause dust is, from an
environmental point of view,

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.040
is a really good way
to tell what you and I

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.960
and our house are being exposed to.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.730
- [Derek] Identifying
dangerous contaminants

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:16.920
is a big part of what these
standard reference materials

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.100
are for, which is why they have
several types of lead paint

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.290
or water from a glacier in Greenland.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:25.710
- These are so rare that we
have to limit distribution

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:29.100
of one unit per customer per three years.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:29.933
- Whoa.

00:15:29.933 --> 00:15:32.310
Or dirt From New Jersey and Montana.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:33.960
- We have a lot of soil samples.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.450
They had the permission
to go into, essentially,

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:40.440
a contaminated industrial
site in Bozeman, Montana

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.110
and collect a bunch of rocks,
you know, five gallon pail

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.820
and bring 'em back and crunch 'em up.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.560
And so these are certified, again,

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.543
for things like toxic elements.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:51.780
- [Derek] Now the ultimate way to measure

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.640
what contaminants we're exposed to

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.863
is by what comes out of us.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.840
Which is why NIST sells domestic sludge.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.870
This is a record of what
has come out of our bodies

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:05.580
and down our sewers.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.670
Researchers can examine
it for traces of toxins

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:09.930
or heavy metals.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.210
Contaminants that many
of us may be exposed to

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:13.500
without knowing.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.320
It's really about
environmental monitoring.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.640
And next year they're coming out

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.040
with an actual human poop product.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.830
- It's been in the news
quite a bit as, you know,

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:25.830
health is related to
your microbiome, right?

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.710
And we're starting to
understand that, you know,

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:31.980
your gut flora and what's in your stomach

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.620
is hugely important to your
health, your mental attitude,

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:35.820
just all sorts of things.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:39.270
Fecal matter is an incredibly
difficult matrix to measure

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:41.880
and extract all the
different components out of.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.550
And what this material will do is support

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.620
measurements of the metabolites.

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.770
And it'll be distributed as a
vial of powder, essentially.

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:51.397
- Do you know how much they got?

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.373
- A crap load.
(both laugh)

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.590
- [Derek] As our knowledge
of the world evolves,

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.570
so too do the standard reference materials

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:02.400
stored in this warehouse.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.840
NIST is preparing to launch

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.440
its first living standard
reference material next year.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.230
The living cells will
be hamster ovary cells

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.870
that can produce monoclonal antibodies.

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:16.080
Monoclonal antibodies now
account for five of the 10

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.500
top selling drugs and
over 75 billion dollars

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.570
in annual sales worldwide.

00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:24.150
When monkey pox started
spreading earlier this year,

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.950
one issue with diagnosing the disease

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.110
was that there were no
clear laboratory tests

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:29.970
to tell if someone was infected.

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:32.850
NIST was able to create a
positive control reference

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:35.733
of the monkey pox DNA in just 30 days.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.540
This warehouse is a very
strange place to walk around.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.610
So many disparate pieces of our world

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:44.910
carefully characterized,
labeled, and packaged up.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:46.920
It's a reminder that behind the scenes,

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.300
invisible to most of us,

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.670
there are a group of
people working tirelessly

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:54.120
to ensure that things are
what we think they are.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.730
When we eat peanut butter
on toast, we can be sure

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:59.250
the peanut butter contains
what the label says.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.830
When your blood test comes back
with a cholesterol reading,

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.380
you know it was calibrated
with a standard.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.750
And when you walk into
a steel-framed building,

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:09.090
you know the steel has
the appropriate structural

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:12.060
and mechanical properties
to hold up that structure.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.150
Our world works because,
unbeknownst to most of us,

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.070
there is a small army of people

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.440
diligently checking that what is out there

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.213
aligns with the standards.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.576
Even our poop.

00:18:24.576 --> 00:18:27.159
