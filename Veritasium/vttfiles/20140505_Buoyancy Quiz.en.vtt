00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:04.259
We are doing a buoyancy experiment today

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:10.468
If you drop a golf ball into some dishwashing liquid it sinks, very slowly

00:00:10.468 --> 00:00:12.800
So why does it sink in the detergent?

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:19.160
Because the golf ball is more heavy than the liquid that’s in the container— then the detergent.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:26.820
What do you mean heavier ? Can you elaborate on that at all ? umm probably more dense ? Good. And if I put this in this is saltwater…

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.560
How salt is it ? It's very salty, huh ?

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.720
This is the  saltiest salt water you can make. Okay. And I think it’s saturated solution. What will it do?

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.480
I think it would be floating. Okay, lets have a look… ooh, oh

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.899
Excellent, so the golf ball floats in the salt water… And if you have a look it’s like it’s just is sticking out just a little bit.

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.029
So what does that tell you about it?

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.149
It’s just slightly less dense right? Like it was a lot less dense to when it’s higher.

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.299
Yeah, the question is if we now take the detergent and we pour it in on top of the golf ball.

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.789
What do you think will happen? Will the golf ball stay where it is ? Will it go down ? Or will it go up ?

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.790
I think it’ll go down a little bit.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.339
Yeah, why do you think that ? Well ? No let’s see.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.920
Whites lighter.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.400
Maybe it'll go up. I have no idea. I think it will go down a little bit.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.790
Do you think this is going to mix with that ? Well that's what I was thinking about

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.259
I wonder if it’s gonna mix or if it’s gonna layer itself, and just, sort of sit on top here.

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.479
Yeah, I think this would be

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.659
standing up, on top.

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.399
So you can make your prediction by clicking on one of the on-screen annotations or you can click a link in the description.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.380
But make your prediction now. What do you think is Gonna happen to this golf ball ? Ready in three, two, one.
