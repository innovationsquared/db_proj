00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.200
I'm at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.800
and I'm here to see the first drone that's gonna fly on another planet.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.000
It's the Mars helicopter. Come on!

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.840
- So this is our baby.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.800
- No way!

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.880
- Yeah.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.600
- That thing right there is the actual machine that is going to take off and land on Mars.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.560
It's going with the Mars 2020 mission. That is the Mars helicopter.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.920
- This will be the first powered flight in another planet.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.700
- How awesome is that?

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.600
Now it's necessary to say first powered flight,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.920
because in 1985, the Soviet Vega missions deployed two helium balloons on Venus.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.960
They transmitted data for over forty six hours while floating at an altitude of 54 kilometers in Venus's dense atmosphere,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.320
which at the surface has a pressure of over 90 Earth atmospheres.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.560
In contrast, Mars has very little atmosphere, only around 1% of Earth's.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:05.480
- Flying this kind of helicopter is equivalent to flying a similar helicopter on Earth at a hundred thousand feet.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.160
So you don't know, you don't hear about many helicopters at a hundred thousand.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.280
I think forty thousand feet is probably the record.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.320
- I checked. Forty thousand feet is the record altitude reached by helicopters on Earth.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.720
85,000 feet is the highest a plane has ever flown.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.520
On Mars, the air is even thinner than that.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.560
- Right. In terms of density is 1% of what you have in this room.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.560
So in this room, a cubic meter of air is about a kilogram.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.680
- Yeah
- The same cubic meter on Mars will be about 15 grams to 18 grams.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.680
So that much

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.520
- So you have to push a lot of air down.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.440
- Yes. You gotta get a lot of air flowing.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.400
And so the obvious trick, if you will, is to spin the blades faster.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.320
- It can spin between 2300 rpm and 2900 rpm.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.240
- That is fast.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.240
- That is fast. Yes.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.200
- Here I'm trying to work out exactly how fast that is.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.040
So I looked it up, and on Earth helicopters typically spin their rotors at around 500 rpm.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.360
So the Mars helicopter will have to spin its blades five times faster.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.320
- But there are some limits you know, you really don't want to get the tips of the blades breaking the speed of sound,

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.040
- cause then you have shockwaves and all sorts of

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.760
- and you get all kinds of funky aerodynamics and you know the transonic flows and things like that, so you don't want to go there.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.560
So we, in our designs, keep the tip Mach numbers down to below about 0.7.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.040
- So 70% the speed sound.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.360
- Yeah. It was very conservative.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.080
- One advantage of flying on Mars is that gravity is only 38% of what it is on Earth.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.320
Even so, making the craft lightweight was essential.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.560
- Keeping the mass of this vehicle contained during the entire design process has been the major challenge.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.000
- Every single part had to be considered.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.840
The entire vehicle is less than 1.8 kilograms

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.360
- Woah!

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.560
- So, less than four pounds

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.120
- That's about the same as this laptop.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.640
- The blades are a foam core with carbon fiber layup. Each of them is about 35 grams.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.040
- Wow.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.600
- Yes, it's quite light. Yes.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.400
- 35 grams is the mass of six quarters.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:15.280
Think about that: two 35 gram blades lifting an 1800 gram helicopter by spinning 40 times per second in just 1% of Earth's atmosphere.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.360
How long can it fly for?

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.560
- It's designed to fly up to 90 seconds.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.000
- A minute and a half of flight.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.480
- Yes.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.560
- To me that sounds like forever,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.280
when you're talking about another planet, flying autonomously by itself

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.840
in 1/100 earth atmosphere, I mean, come on!

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.440
Like, that's a long time!

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.120
- That is. Yeah.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.520
- One of the questions I had was, why didn't they use a quadcopter design?

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.600
Well, because on Mars, the blades have to be so long that the whole craft would barely fit on the rover.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.560
Two counter-rotating propellers provide the simplest design.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.200
They also generate lift more efficiently when stacked on top of each other.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.280
- The bottom rotor sees the sort of the more compactified flow.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.800
The top one pulls it, the bottom one sees sort of a more concentrated flow.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.040
So the bottom rotor actually can do better than if they were separated apart.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.760
- But how do you test a helicopter designed for conditions on Mars on Earth?

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.560
What would happen if you just took your Mars helicopter and you tried to take off on Earth?

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.960
- It would just make a lot of noise.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:18.520
- Really?

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.440
- And it probably wouldn't get the full head speed either...

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.240
- because of how much atmosphere we've got.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.920
- Exactly, it's like trying to swim in a thick soup.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.040
We have a really amazing chamber here on lab called the 25-foot space simulator.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.520
And in that chamber you could simulate any kind of atmosphere you want.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.360
You can go to Martian pressures, you can stay at Earth pressures, whatever you want.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.240
But that only took care of half of the problem, that was the aerodynamics aspect of it.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.200
There's the other part which is the gravity.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.600
We needed a way to fake Mars' gravity here on Earth,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.760
and the best way that we could figure out to do that was a gravity offload.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.040
- Gravity offload just means pulling up on the helicopter,

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.080
so it only has to support about 38% of its weight just like it will have to do on Mars.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.200
- And effectively it was a high-tech fishing reel,

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.080
so taking a brushed DC motor, a reaction torque sensor, and a pulley,

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.240
mounting that a couple stories in the air

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.360
and then attaching a fishing string to the top of the helicopter

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.880
that would tug the necessary force required to offload the differences in gravity.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.120
- An actual fishing line?

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.200
- Yeah, real fishing line.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.600
- But isn't that stretchy,

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.880
like don't you want something that's perfectly rigid so as soon as you apply the torque it gets applied to the craft?

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.960
- Right right, and we did a lot of testing with different vendors to find out which fishing line had the best spring constant for us.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.920
- What does the helicopter sound like?

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.040
I imagined that in 1% of Earth's atmosphere, the helicopter would be pretty quiet.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.200
- Yeah you're still at 1%, but it's still, real loud.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.760
- Really?

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.520
- Yeah we have audio recordings of it too.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.460
But it's it's, I would characterize it more like a 'baaaaaaaaah', something like that.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.440
(baaaaaaah)

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.640
When gravity offload systems working and the chamber was pumped down, the helicopter thought it was on Mars.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.960
It felt like it was on Mars.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.840
- How do you actually steer this thing around and drive it?

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.040
- So the way helicopters work is they have something called collective and cyclic.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.960
So what collectives do is they change the pitch on the blades uniformly.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.640
So throughout the entire revolution you will move the collective,

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.800
the blades will change, you can change your angle of attack, you'll get more lift

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.280
so that's basically what you would provides you height control,

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.040
Right? You pitch more you go up, pitch less you come down.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.320
But then, there's something called a cyclic on helicopters,

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:29.040
which basically what it does is it modulates the pitch as it goes around,

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.200
so it can pitch it a little bit more here, less here, so it kind of like modulates.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.640
So what that does is it provides an asymmetric torque, right?

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.040
When you're pitched up there you get that additional torque.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:46.960
Now you get it, depending upon the stiffness the system you actually get it with that a gyroscopic lag that can happen afterwards.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:54.200
So once you get an asymmetric torque, the vehicle wants to start pitching or rolling. Right?

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.600
So once it pitches and rolls,

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.400
you're doing it stably.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:05.480
You are now pointed in a direction and your thrust vector now has a component that's horizontal in the direction that you pitched. Right?

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.680
So then you start translating in that direction.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.240
- I've heard that initially someone tried to fly it with a joystick?

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.600
- Yes.
- Was it an early prototype?

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.880
- If you were sitting right there on Mars and you were trying to joystick it, what is it like?

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.040
And it's almost unflyable.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.760
And the reason for that it's the aerodynamics of when you want to command a roll to the left

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.640
because you see yourself starting to move to the right and you start commanding a roll to the left.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.160
There's a delay aspect.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.840
So that that delay effect makes it very very difficult for a human to try and pilot it.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.240
- You can't fly this from Earth...

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.760
- because of the twenty-minute kind of time delay, so you have to really send sequences.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.200
- So essentially you're gonna push a button,

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.280
and like 20 minutes later it'll take off and do its thing and then you will find out.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.200
- The way this flies autonomously,

00:07:51.200 --> 00:08:00.560
it has onboard gyros, onboard accelerometers and onboard camera,  an altimeter and an inclinometer;

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.640
and so using that sensor suite,

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:10.680
real-time measurement, you know against terrain and of course the gyros and the accelerometers sensing onboard

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:19.200
the real-time estimation of the state of the vehicle is made continuously again at hundreds of Hertz

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.400
and then that's fed into the closed-loop control algorithm,

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.440
that takes the estimated state

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.720
and then generates the correction that's needed at the blade level,

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.000
and then the blades are continuously being controlled.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.400
So when you see video tapes of our "successful flights", right!

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:44.520
And the vehicle looks dead calm, it's coming up, and hovering, and going laterally, coming back;

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:51.240
you know the machines are working very very fast and very very hard it just looks very calm, but yes

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.840
so the the blades are being continuously controlled.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.280
- That is amazing.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.880
How will it handle a gentle breeze?

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.020
- A lot of the movies depict
- Dust storms?

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.840
- The big dust storms as being very aggressive on Mars.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:10.000
The truth of the matter is that with 1% Earth's atmosphere, there is very little matter actually hitting you.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.240
- I mean, you're using that to lift yourself.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.160
- Exactly, so there's enough to lift, right?

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.840
But we also need to spend at 2200 rpms to be in the ballpark of lifting ourselves.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.080
- We built our own wind tunnel that we put inside this 25 foot chamber.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.760
How many fans was it, Teddy?

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.800
960 computer fans.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.720
So, but it does sound like a like a jet engine taking off.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:34.600
So we built a fan wall array, it's called an open cross-section wind tunnel, where you don't need the walls,

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.960
just the fact of having an array of fans we are very confident of being able to go at 11 meters per second,

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.200
in this vehicle.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.400
if I had known that somewhere along the way I'd be building a wind tunnel to do this,

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.160
I would have probably not taken the job on, right?

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.840
- How long does it take to recharge?

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.640
We recharge the whole day.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.720
So, the whole day at Mars.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.920
- Right. But does that mean that you could do one flight a day kind of thing? In theory?

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.160
- In theory, yes, by design it can.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.320
- What is the size of the battery?

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.320
- Between 35 and 40 watt hours total.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.080
- That's equivalent to just three smartphone batteries.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.280
And get this -- most of that energy isn't even used for flying.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.520
- It has to survive temperatures as low as about minus 80 to minus hundred degrees C at night.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:25.000
So we keep the batteries warm and we surround the batteries with our electronics board so the electronic boards also stay warm.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.240
We take approximately two-thirds of energy just keeping things warm and warming things up to operate.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.480
Only one-third of the energy is available for flight.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.160
- Do you have insulation on there to keep it warm?

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.480
- Yes. When you look at that helicopter, right, you have the solar panel on top with antenna,

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.240
and then next is the rotor system,

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.000
and then bottom what you see this cube, is what we call the fuselage,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.440
you are seeing it now actually uncovered

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:54.400
because you're seeing the last day of final. We're recovering for delivery to be integrated onto the rover.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.560
okay so usually you won't be seeing that.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.280
So the center of the cube is the ring of batteries, okay.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.920
There is space between the battery and the circuit boards that you are seeing.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.520
And then there will be a shell that we put on called the fuselage shell,

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.760
and that will close like CO2, the gas, around.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:20.240
And so the enclosure itself we're using the CO2 gas as the insulation material

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.240
- Oh wow! No aerogel?

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.720
- No aerogel. We did it consider it. It was in the game,

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.640
it was in the consideration in the beginning,

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:37.960
and it turns out that just the CO2 as insulator itself was sufficient for us to close our thermal model.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.320
- Right.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.320
- And so guess why we wouldn't want to use aerogel if we have a choice.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.080
- Weight.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.320
- Yep, there you go. Welcome to our team

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.240
- Now before the helicopter can experience the frigid conditions on Mars,

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.040
first it has to get there.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.880
And that's a reminder that not only is this an aircraft, it's also a spacecraft.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.380
- It has to survive launch.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:02.840
It has to survive launch loads which, you know, easily exceed about 80G

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.760
You know, because of the vibration. Vibrational loads are 80G.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.440
- Yeah.
Then it has to survive the seven-month trip, complete with radiation.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:17.240
And finally after pulling nine Gs on entry into the Martian atmosphere the helicopter needs to be deployed.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:22.680
This is gonna be on the rover, before you take off, does the rover like pick you up and put you down somewhere?

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.800
- We're gonna be stowed underneath the rover on the belly pan on our side.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:32.560
And there's gonna be several several sequences of firings of explosive devices

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.819
to actually rotate us right side up and then drop us on the surface.

00:12:35.819 --> 00:12:40.920
- For example the very last thing the rover does is it's got us by this bolt, it's holding us about this high,

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.720
and then it goes has to drop us, right?

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.040
- Yeah.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.000
- So how do you undo a bolt on, on a spacecraft?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:46.600
- You blow it up.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.120
- You blow it up. Basically it's materials you know undergoes a phase transition

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.240
which suddenly increases the, the stress in the metal part of the thing

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.840
and makes the bolt break. It's called a frangibolt.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.240
- Then once we're on the surface, the rover drives over us,

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.160
it gets about 100 meters away,

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.120
and then we have about a two-hour counter internally,

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:11.080
where we'll wake up after 2 hours, wait to hear some RF transmissions,

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.920
and if we do get that link with the rover then great.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.720
- Our base station on the rover would issue the fly now command.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.040
First flight will probably be a mutual selfie, you would think..

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.440
This is after all the selfie age.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.320
- I like that as the goal of the first flight.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.920
- Yes it is. In fact, it is good to know the best time to fly this

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.880
is at 11 o'clock in the morning local time on Mars.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.680
and that the reason for that is, we would have come out of the night,

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.240
where we would have spent a lot of battery power trying to you know stay warm.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.920
By 11 o'clock, the state of the charge would have gotten to the point where you could fly

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.600
without risking a brownout on the battery and then, you know, dropping the whole craft to the ground.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.880
Also 11 o'clock is where the Sun would have warmed up things,

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.520
so we don't quite have to heat up as much.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:02.120
And also it's not late afternoon where because of the warmth, the density has begun to drop,

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.640
okay, and the winds have begun to pick up.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:09.640
Now, what we will investigate is after we get the first couple of flights under our belt,

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.920
I'm sure we will try to fly in the afternoon and you know do more exploratory things.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.240
But the most conservative thing we can do

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.840
is to sort of pick a mid-morning flight.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.440
- So what is the purpose of this mission?

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.520
The Mars helicopter is first and foremost a technology demonstration

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.200
to prove that we can fly on another planet.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:35.520
The helicopter can take color photos and videos, but its purpose is not to make scientific discoveries.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:41.200
Instead it is to help engineers figure out how to design and build aircraft for future missions.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:47.600
- You can imagine something that's about 30 kilograms carrying you know a 2 kilogram science payload, doing exploration,

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:53.200
acting like a scout, like a small vehicle, like this, scouting ahead for some future rover;

00:14:53.200 --> 00:15:01.840
or it could be a gadget that goes and picks up some kind of samples and brings it back to a central lander for more sophisticated analysis;

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.120
or it could be a completely standalone craft, and maybe more than one

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:10.280
that are exploring places where humans and rovers can't get to easily:

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.560
polar ice caps, you know

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.440
sides of cliffs and so forth.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:21.080
So the real emphasis here is to try to get back all the engineering data so that it can inform that future design.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:25.640
- Flying on other planets will provide a new dimension in space exploration.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:30.600
An aircraft is faster and capable of covering more ground than a rover

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:35.240
and it can provide higher resolution imagery than an orbiting spacecraft.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:42.760
So maybe one day, aircrafts will be the companions of future rovers or even astronauts exploring other worlds.
