00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180
Are you the person in the group who's always getting bitten by mosquitoes? Because I certainly am

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.280
and science has shown that this is a thing - that mosquitoes are more attracted to some people

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.360
than others. And the reason for that is at least partially genetic, which is why

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.260
this video is supported by 23andMe, a company that reads sections of your genetic code

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.200
and then helps you understand, what's in there.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.900
Now, they've actually been involved in some research that has identified particular spots on your DNA

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.859
that make you more or less likely to be attractive to mosquitoes, and in this video

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.240
I want to put that to the test. So I flew to New Mexico State University

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.240
to meet mosquito man Professor Immo Hansen.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.420
Everyone: Hello!

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.120
Hansen: We have a collection of lab strains

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.660
Derek: Here, he maintains colonies of many different species of mosquitoes, and one exotic strain

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.420
he actually feeds with his own blood(!)

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.620
Hansen: No, no, I'm serious. These ones are made from my blood.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.780
D: Really!?
H: Yes! Absolutely, yeah.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.800
D: You feed these!?
H: And I'm the only one feeding them - I can't ask my students, you know, that would be a nightmare

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.560
H: getting permissions to this room here.
D: How do you blood feed them?

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.840
D: With just, sticking your arm in there?
H: Well, I just put my arm in there and wait

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.080
D: Is it psychologically itchy or...?
H: No it is really itchy [laughs]

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.000
H: Yeah, and I'm getting, I mean, 25 bites or so right now

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.420
D: Mosquitoes need our blood proteins to make their eggs, so only the female mosquitoes bite.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.180
The eggs hatch into these wriggly larvae, which develop into pupae

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.820
before becoming flying, adult mosquitoes. Then they, once again, seek out vertebrate blood to make more eggs.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.300
The whole lifecycle takes just two weeks! But what I wanted to know is: am I a desirable target?

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.820
D: How can we figure out if I'm attractive to mosquitoes?

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.899
H: Okay, we have a Y-tube, basically, which has a holding chamber. We put the mosquitoes down here,

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.840
H: there's a little fan inducing a draft, something like 4&nbsp;m/s.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.860
We're gonna insert a bait into one of these chambers, in the green or the yellow one.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.440
D: So, by bait, you're saying me?
H: Yes, you, exactly.
D: [laughs]

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.920
H: You put your hand in there. [It] would be good if you would rub your hand first, so

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.940
H: If you're sweaty...
D: Get some oils?
H: Yes!

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.420
D: This is the right spot...
H: That's where the good stuff is, exactly.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.360
H: Almost feeds exclusively on humans. They are really specialized on biting humans.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.560
D: That's good to know...
H: Yeah
[both laugh]

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.440
H: There's 20 mosquitoes in the holding chamber.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.840
D: And they're gonna decide whether to come and find me, or go down the other side and... they find nothing.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.380
H: Right.
D: We're releasing the mosquitoes. I see them coming!

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.380
D: Oh, he's chosen wrong!

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.620
H: Do you see that?

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.460
H: Man, you are attractive!

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.700
D: Really?
H: I mean, sorry I-
[both laugh]

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.420
H: You are a strong attractant to mosquitoes. They all went in your direction.
D: None of them went the other way!

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.480
D: (laughing) This is amazing!

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.020
H: Well, there's one stranded in here
D: I did not expect to have such a strong... response, like

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.460
D: You see all those mosquitoes...

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.939
D: This type of test was actually used to discover that the basis for our attractiveness to mosquitoes is at least partially genetic.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.740
Researchers recruited 18 pairs of identical female twins and 19 pairs of non identical, or fraternal female twins.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.380
Then they used the Y-tube Test to evaluate the mosquito attractiveness of each individual,

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.340
measured by the fraction of mosquitoes who correctly flew to the arm of the tube where the twin was standing.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.270
What scientists found is that the mosquito attractiveness of twins is

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.880
correlated, that is, the more attractive you are to mosquitoes, the more likely your twin is, too.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.240
But that's... not all that surprising, and could be caused by environmental factors, or a common diet.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:56.700
But, comparing identical twins to fraternal twins revealed the correlation was higher for identical twins.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.320
This strongly suggests genetics influence how attractive you are to mosquitoes.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.280
Since the identical twins share more of the same genes than fraternal twins, this explains

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.020
why their mosquito attractiveness would be more closely correlated if it really is genetics that

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.020
determines how much mosquitoes like you.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.320
D: With that last test, I was clearly attractive to these mosquitoes.
H: Yes.
D: Except we weren't comparing me to any other human,

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.100
D: we were just comparing me to a control, no human.
H: Exactly, yes.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.660
D: So, what if we compare myself with my wife Raquel? [laughs]
H: Uh-huh?

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.360
D: Normally, I get bitten and she doesn't.
H: Okay.
D: So this should be a good test... maybe?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
D: To see whether under lab conditions...

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.960
H: We can we reproduce your...
D: We'll reproduce our anecdotal finding. That I'm more attractive.
H: Exactly, anecdotal evidence a little once again

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.960
H: They are a little...
D: Once again...

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.280
D: ...preparing.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.600
H: Okay!
D: Hands in position!
Raquel: Yeah.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.060
H: Yeah, see, they actually start to wake up. They... smelled something. Something's going on here.
R: Here we go.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.220
H: Okay. 
D: What are we seein'?

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.140
D: Whoa!

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.320
D: I'm getting a good amount over here, but so are you?

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.980
D: Let's see. I think I'm getting more. It looks to me like you got three.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.500
H: Okay, I'm gonna stop the experiment right now.
D: Alright.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.240
H: *chuck!* Okay, now let's count. I think it's seven on your side here?

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.000
Lab assistant: Five in the holding.
H: Five in the holding.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.560
H: And quite a few on your side!
[Hansen and Derek laugh]

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.320
H: So, who gets bitten?
D: I get bitten.
H: You get bitten!

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.180
H: In reality, we would repeat this experiment, maybe eight times or so.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:41.860
D: Right.
H: And switching you guys around, but I think this is a good way to show how this works.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:48.700
D: Okay, so that result was not particularly scientifically rigorous, but it did reproduce our experience in the wild,

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:55.040
D: which is that I am much more attractive. ....Well at least when it comes to mosquitoes, than Raquel.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.600
D: But the question is, I guess, does this come down to our genetics?

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.420
R: Yeah, so, we spat into some tubes and sent them off to be tested.
D: Right, and we were interested in seven particular

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:11.200
D: locations on our DNA, which were located in a 2017 study that involved 23andMe.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.740
D: So the way 23andMe works is, when you sign up, you can opt in to be part of research,

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.340
D: and 16 000 people agreed to be part of this study and rate their perceived attractiveness to mosquitoes.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:27.240
D: So then what the scientists did was a genome-wide association study, that is, they looked at all the DNA

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.600
D: of all of those participants and tried to see if there were commonalities amongst the people who

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.920
D: said they were attractive to mosquitoes and that were different to the people who said they weren't attractive to mosquitoes.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:44.280
D: And they identified seven particular locations on the DNA. Seven single letter changes which seemed

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.840
D: to be associated with different levels of attractiveness to mosquitoes.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.620
D: So we have our results back, and do you wanna see them?
R: I do. I do, I'm very curious.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.660
D: Alright, let's pull it up here.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:02.880
D: Okay, so of the seven locations that are related to mosquito attractiveness, it turns out we have the identical DNA at four of them.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.140
D: So you can rule those out.
R: Okay.
D: Which leaves only three areas where we actually have differing

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:15.660
D: DNA. So, at the first location, you have one copy of a letter change which actually makes you significantly

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.660
D: *protected* from mosquitoes.
R: Oh, no way!

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.450
D: Yeah, it's associated with decreased attractive to mosquitoes
R: Oh, that's cool!

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:29.240
D: I do not have any letter changes at that location. Now, at the second location where we differ, I have

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:35.840
D: a letter change compared to you that makes *me* less attractive to mosquitoes, so more protected.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.260
R: Interesting.
D: If you look at the significance of those two letter changes,

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.800
D: yours is about twice as significant than mine.
R: Okay.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:50.760
D: But still we both have a protective letter switch. So, in the last snip we actually differ significantly.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:57.120
D: And I have two copies of a variant that makes me more attractive to mosquitoes.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:01.420
D: This was the only snip which was associated with being more attractive to mosquitoes,

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:07.120
D: and I have two copies of that change, and you have no copies of that change.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:12.480
R: So that makes sense.
D: So overall, I would say our genetics really adds up here.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:17.640
D: And of course, we can't say that this proves that it is right, but it is definitely consistent

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:22.440
D: with these snips actually being associated with your attractiveness to mosquitoes, and that's sort of...

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.000
D: borne out by our experience.
R: That's so cool!

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:30.760
D: Now, it's unclear exactly how these genetic changes might make us more or less attractive to mosquitoes,

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:35.920
but it's likely that it has something to do with the odor or the volatile chemicals

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.340
that our bodies give off, and due to the microbiome, the bacteria on our skin.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.920
One of the main signals that mosquitoes like to follow is carbon dioxide.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:51.520
So that means if you have a higher metabolism, or if you've just been exercising, or if you're a bigger person, or even if you're pregnant,

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:57.540
you are more likely to attract mosquitoes. But mosquitoes are also attracted to some other volatiles

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.660
that we give off, things like lactic acid, acetone and ammonia.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:08.980
But scientists have also found some chemicals that repel, or appear to impair mosquitoes' ability to find us.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:17.780
Those chemicals we naturally give off are octanal, nonanal, decanal, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.680
So, why is this important?

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:25.200
Well the researchers estimate that our attractiveness to mosquitoes is about as hereditary as height

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.780
or IQ, that is to say genetics play a significant role here, so

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.760
understanding that relationship is really important, especially when you consider that, of all the animals,

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.520
mosquitoes have the greatest impact on human health.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.040
D: Are mosquitoes the worst animal of all time for humans?
H: Absolutely.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:48.920
H: Absolutely, there's no question about that. Malaria has killed more people than people have killed people. They are the most dangerous animal in the world.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:54.980
D: By some estimates, mosquitoes have killed more than half of the humans who have ever lived.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:10:02.580
Now, that estimate has been debated and is likely too high, but even so, this year, over a million people will die

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:08.560
of mosquito-borne illnesses. So if not half, certainly a significant number of humans have died

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:13.360
due to mosquitoes, probably more than any other single cause, which led me to wonder:

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:20.820
D: Do you think humans may have evolved this trait to smell worse to mosquitoes as an adaptation to avoid the diseases? Or...

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.740
D: is it just by accident that some people are less attractive to mosquitoes than others?

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.560
H: .......

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.620
H: ...That is a really good question!
[both laugh]

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.100
D: And while we're on the subject of evolution, consider this:

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:39.580
if you ever contract malaria, it actually changes your body chemistry

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:43.960
to make you produce an odor that makes you more attractive to mosquitoes.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:50.160
Think about that! The malaria parasite has evolved so that, when it's in its host,

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:56.360
it makes the host more attractive to mosquitoes... mosquitoes are the thing that transmit malaria!

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:00.640
It's phenomenal! I mean evolution is incredible!

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.740
[Veritasium logo]

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:10.380
This episode of veritasium is supported by 23andMe, a company whose name comes from the fact that

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:14.480
humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and the point of the company is to help people

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.200
understand what's written in your chromosomes. Now, at the minute, you can't get access to

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.580
the mosquito attractiveness test, but maybe, one day in the future, you will be able to.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:28.700
Right now, you can access tons of information about your physical traits, about aspects of your health,

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:34.360
and about where you DNA and, I guess, you come from. So I thought I would share my results with you.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:40.720
I come from all over the world as you can see from the map, but significantly more from Europe, about 95% European.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:46.520
You can drill down into that and see that I'm largely British and Irish, and French and German, with a bit of Scandinavian.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:53.780
What's interesting to me is, there's a 3.3% South Asian which is something I think my family suspected,

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:58.980
but didn't know for sure, so it's interesting the types of information you can find out which is stored in your DNA.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:04.700
So, if you wanna find out about the information in your DNA, you can go to 23andme.com/veritasium.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.440
So I want to thank 23andMe for supporting Veritasium, and I want to thank you for watching.
