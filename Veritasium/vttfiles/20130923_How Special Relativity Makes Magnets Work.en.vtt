00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:06.979
Only a few elements can be permanent magnets
- iron is one.

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:08.900
Copper is not.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:17.480
But if you pass an electric current through
any metal it becomes a magnet - an electromagnet.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.740
But how does this work?

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.349
Well strangely enough, it's a consequence
of special relativity.

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.289
Special relativity is the fact that in our
universe, length and time aren't absolute;

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.050
they're perceived differently by observers
moving relative to each other (hence, "relativity").

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.480
For example, if you measure carefully enough,
you'll find that time passes slower for observers

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.210
moving relative to you.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.320
Hey Derek, when did you last shave?

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.820
Derek1: Six hours ago.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:49.620
MovingDerek: Actually it was five hours, 59
minutes and 59.99999999999 seconds

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.180
And moving objects are also contracted in
their direction of motion.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.180
You're looking slim.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.309
Only in your frame of reference.

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.460
So when an object is moving relative to you,
it actually takes up less space than when

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.530
it's not moving.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.630
And even though this effect is obviously way
tinier than we've shown, length contraction

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.610
IS what makes an electromagnet work.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.370
Picture a copper wire - it consists of positive
metal ions swimming in a sea of free negative

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.510
electrons.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.450
Now the number of protons is equal to the
number of negative electrons so overall the

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.810
wire is neutral.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.360
So if there were a positive charged, err...
positively charged cat nearby, it would experience

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.610
no force from the wire on it at all.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.350
And even if there were a current in the wire,
the electrons would just be drifting in one

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.150
direction, but the density of positive and
negative charges would still be the same,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.650
and so the wire would be neutral, so no force
on the kitty.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.580
But what if the cat starts moving?

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.530
Imagine for simplicity that that the cat is
moving in the same direction as the electrons

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.290
with the same velocity.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.670
Well now in my frame of reference, the wire
is still neutral and so there should be no

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.650
force on the cat, but consider the same situation
in her frame of reference.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.150
In the cat's frame of reference the positive
charges in the wire are moving, so according

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.790
to special relativity their separation will
be ever-so-slightly contracted.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.679
Also, from this perspective the electrons
aren't moving so they'll be more spread out

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.940
than before - remember, objects take up more
space when they're not moving than when they

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:13.940
are.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.080
These two changes together mean there's a
higher density of positive charges in the

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.500
wire, so it's no longer neutral - it's positively
charged!

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.470
Which means that the positively charged cat
will feel a repulsive electric force from

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.470
the wire.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.880
But in my frame of reference this seems mysterious:
there's no force on a stationary charged cat,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.670
but a moving cat is somehow repelled from
this neutral wire.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.890
How do you account for this force?

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.550
Well we say it is the magnetic force, and
that's mainly because a wire with current

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.570
in it deflects nearby magnets.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.810
So really, what this experiment shows is that
a magnetic field is just an electric field

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.140
viewed from a different frame of reference.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.080
In the cat's frame of reference, it is repelled
from the wire due to the electric field created

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.280
by the excess positive charges produced by
the effects of length contraction.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.990
In MY frame of reference, the cat is repelled
from a neutral wire due to the magnetic field

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.790
generated by current flowing in the wire.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.200
So whether you see it as an electric or a
magnetic field just depends on your frame

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.540
of reference, but in either case the results
are the same.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.819
So an electromagnet is an everyday example
of special relativity in action.

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.110
Now that might seem crazy since electrons
drift through wires at about .0000000001%

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:30.930
the speed of light - so how can special relativity
have anything to do with it?

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.400
Well the truth is there are enough electrons
in a wire, and the electric interaction is

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.700
so amazingly strong that even the minuscule
effects of length contraction can produce

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.570
significant charge imbalances that produce
a noticeable force.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.060
So special relativity explains electromagnets
- but what about permanent magnets?

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.060
Yeah!

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.340
I mean there can't be electrical currents
flowing around inside lumps of rock, can there?
