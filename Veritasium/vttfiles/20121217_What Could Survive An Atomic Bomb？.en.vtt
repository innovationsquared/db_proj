According to popular myth, cockroaches would
inherit a post nuclear disaster world.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.519
But it looks like the real winners might actually
be fungi.

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:17.800
In 1999 fungi were found to be thriving in
highly radioactive conditions inside the Chernobyl

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.110
reactor.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.060
These fungi are rich in melanin, yup, the
same stuff that gives you tan in summer.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.830
While radiation causes cell damage and mutations
in most living creatures, melanin rich fungi

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.520
are actually attracted to the stuff.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.880
And it seems the spherical nature of the melanin
acts as a shield, but it also allows energy

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.300
to be absorbed from the radiation, enhancing
the fungi’s growth.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.570
These fungi may one day help clean up radioactive
waste or even lead to the development of new

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.570
cancer treatments.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.840
But if there is a nuclear accident in the
meantime, don’t panic right away.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.210
That mushroom cloud might not be what you
think it is.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.660
Hey, everyone, that is just a little segment
I voiced for an Aussie TV show called Catalyst.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.200
And actually I have been traveling with this
TV show for the last five weeks, in case you

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.590
have been wondering where I was.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.920
And, in fact, I have been traveling with two
other people, Anya and Simon.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.310
Ok, so we are doing Catalyst on the road,
which is actually a road trip from Perth to

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.780
Melbourne and we have had an amazing time
including things like ...

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.920
&gt;&gt; Cave diving.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.920
&gt;&gt; And

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.920
&gt;&gt; Catching Malawi.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.750
&gt;&gt; And land sailing on a salt lake.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.159
So we have done some incredible stuff and
that is all going to go to air in Australia

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.830
on ABC-1 starting in February.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.850
If you want to check out their YouTube channel,
you can look at it ... I will put an annotation

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.850
here.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.080
You can click this and go to their YouTube
channel.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.880
And if you are really nice to them, maybe
they will post some of this episode, some

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.130
of these episodes on their YouTube channel.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.530
Besides that, I will be back in Sydney after
Christmas and then I will make some more Veritasium

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.180
style stuff, so stay tuned for that.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.500
That is disgusting.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.660
I cannot believe this.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.149
Ahh.
