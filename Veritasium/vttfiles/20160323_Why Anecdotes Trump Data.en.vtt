00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.980
Some critics of the TV show Mythbusters claim

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.880
that the show misrepresents the scientific process.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.980
For example, experiments are sometimes conducted only once

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.220
and without adequate controls,

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.940
but then these results are

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.940
generalized to make definitive claims

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.820
rather than repeating the experiment

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.440
and using statistical analysis as a scientist would

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.720
to figure out what is really true.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.400
So, ironically a show

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.600
that is meant to educate people about science

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.120
may instead be giving them the opposite impression

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.020
of how science works.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.760
But you know, similar criticisms had been made of Veritasium.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.040
For example, when Destin and I performed

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.220
our experiments to show that the water swirls

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.920
the opposite way in the northern and southern hemispheres,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.800
we only showed doing it once

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.500
even though we each did it three or four times in our own hemisphere.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.420
And I guess that brings forth the question

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.540
should we change what we're doing --

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.620
I mean should Mythbusters and Veritasium

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.980
really show the repetitive nature of science

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.000
and use statistical results as evidence for our claims.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.200
Well my answer is no, but to understand why

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.280
we first have to dig into something called

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.600
the helping experiment.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.360
And this was performed in New York

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.300
in the 1960s. And the way it went was --

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.100
individual participants were placed in isolated booths

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.300
where they could speak to five other participants through an intercom

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.180
but only one mic was live at a time.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.900
And these participants were meant to speak in turns

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.420
for two minutes each about their lives --

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.960
any problems they were having --

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.380
and it would just go in rounds.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.480
Now what the participants didn't know was that

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.060
one of them was actually an actor

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.440
who was reading a script

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.960
prepared for him by the experimenters.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.800
And he went first in the first round.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.300
He talked about the problems he was having adjusting to life in New York City

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.700
and particularly the difficulty that he gets the seizures, particularly when stressed.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.040
And so everyone else had their turn and then it came back 'round

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.980
to this actor again. Now this time

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.400
when he was speaking he became more and more incoherent as he

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.700
was talking. He said that he could feel a seizure coming on and he made choking noises,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.320
he asked for help from the other participants --

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.460
he said he felt like he was dying --

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.080
and, uh, then he continued to get more and more distressed

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.560
until his mic went off.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.760
And the point of the experiment was to see how many of the participants would help.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.620
I mean, if you were one of the other participants, do you think you would've left your booth

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.700
and gone to see if he was okay?

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.820
In total, about 13 participants took part in this experiment --

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.220
and the number that helped before his mic was turned off --

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.720
was just four.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.220
Now, while this might sound a little bit disappointing

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.400
about the state of human helpfulness,

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.720
you gotta keep in mind that there were other people listening to the same distress call

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.020
and that may have diffused the responsibility that individuals would feel;

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.260
this is something known as the "bystander effect."

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.300
Now, what's interesting about this experiment from my point of view

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.260
is not how it confirms the bystander effect,

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.240
but in how people view the results.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.260
For example, they fail to change their opinion

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.440
of themselves or others after learning about this experiment.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.940
For example, have you changed your opinion

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.920
about how likely you would be to help in this situation --

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.200
now that you know that only 30 percent of people did, in that situation?

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.300
Well, there was a follow-up study conducted

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.980
where students were shown two videos

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.020
of individual participants who were purported to be from the original study.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.180
And they had already learned about the study,

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.180
and then they were asked at the end of watching those two videos --

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.800
which were pretty uninformative, just showed that these people were

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.540
good, decent, ordinary people --

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.240
these students were asked,

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.080
"How likely do you think it was

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.500
that those two particular participants helped?"

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.080
And overwhelmingly students felt

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.620
that those two participants would have helped --

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.240
even though they knew that, statistically, only 30 percent did, so,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.620
in fact, if would've been a better guess to say that they probably didn't.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.880
They didn't seem to really internalize

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.080
those general results as pertaining to the particular,

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.360
they kind of assumed it excluded

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.400
ordinary, good, decent people.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.060
Now, is there a way to get people to really

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.240
understand how the world works?

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.400
Well, they did another follow-up study

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.600
where they talked about the experiment,

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.860
they described the experiment,

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.220
but they didn't give the results.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.260
And then they showed those two participant videos --

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.000
again, not mentioning anything about the experiment,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.940
just showing that these are two, decent, ordinary people

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.860
and then they told the students that those two people

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.680
did not help in the experiment.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.160
And they asked the students to, uh, guess

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160
what proportion of people did help.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.740
And now, in this case, when they were going

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.420
from those particular examples of ordinary, nice people

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.600
who didn't help,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.060
they were much better at generalizing

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.020
to the overall result,

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.620
to the statistical result.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.040
In fact, they got it basically right.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.160
And I think this highlights for us that

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.720
our brains are much better at

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.040
working with individual stories

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.360
and things in detail

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.740
than they are with statistical results.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.420
And that is why I think

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.340
if you're Mythbusters or Veritasium

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.820
it's better to communicate science --

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.320
to tell the story,

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.120
to show the experiment, really, once in a dramatic way --

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.220
rather than three or four times

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.860
where each new iteration --

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.180
well, each repetition --

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.120
just confirms the original result that you were talking about.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.120
But if you're actually doing the science.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.260
If you're actually trying to establish scientific fact --

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.240
then of course

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.800
you need the repetition and the statistical analysis.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.340
So I think it really does come down to what your objectives are.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.340
But with this conclusion

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.200
I think this opens up

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.100
two big potential pitfalls.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.500
One is that people without scientific evidence

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.200
can make crafty stories

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.020
that catch on

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.480
and quickly become what people feel is the truth.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.480
And the other pitfall is scientists

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.680
Who have strong scientific evidence --

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.040
Who have clear statistical results --

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.040
and yet they can't communicate them to people

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.060
because they don't have a great story.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.060
So, an example of the first pitfall

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.060
is the recent spread of this rumor

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.140
That the outbreak of a birth defect microsephaly

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.480
in South America was actually caused

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.060
by a larvicide made by Monsanto.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.900
That story caught on like wildfire.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.720
And you can see why because its got this clear villain --

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.720
that everyone loves to hate -- in Monsanto.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.480
And its got a really causal story

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.940
That someone is doing something bad

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.800
to the water -- and its this poison

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.080
that were poisoning ourselves and

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.360
its a very emotive -- clear -- story.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.980
While the other story is, uh,

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.320
Well it's a little bit more statistical -- that there is

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.840
some kind of connection -- which is the scientific consensus

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.840
That the Zika virus carried by

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.700
these, uh, mosquitoes

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.380
is causing the microsephaly.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.520
And there are strong indications that that really is what's happening.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.280
And if you look at the claims about the larvicide,

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.480
they really don't hold much weight.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.000
I mean, the larvicide is so weak,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.160
that you could drink a thousand litres of it a day.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.540
A thousand litres of the water treated with this larvicide and have no adverse effects.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.200
Or, uh, this larvicide has been used in dog and cat pet collars.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:09.420
Um, so really, you know, there isn't strong evidence for the larvicide connection. In fact

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.360
There is no connection between the larvicide and Monsanto at all.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.560
But I think the story took hold because it had such a strong narrative

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.120
On the other hand, you have things like climate change,

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.700
which have very strong statistical evidence to back them up,

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.920
large scale result over the globe.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.560
And yet, one cold snowy winter is so much more, uh,

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.200
visceral and meaningful to individual people

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.260
than this thing which feels, you know,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.820
completely databased.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.980
And, it just depends on how much you trust data, I guess.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.100
As scientists, we love data.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.760
And we feel like, if we're trying to communicate to someone,

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.000
we're trying to convince someone of something,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.240
all we have to do is show more data.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.460
But what experiments demonstrate to us with statistical certainty

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.280
is that stories work much better.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.060
Normally I do this walk and talk self videos on my second channel, 2Veritasium, but

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.100
I imagine that some of you might not know that that exists.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.520
So, I thought I'd put one of these here on 1Veritasium.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:33.600
Plus, this one has a fair amount of data and, you know, experimental stuff in it,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.300
so I figured that could be interesting for you as well.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.720
So if you want to check out the check...

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.120
[CHUCKLES]

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.980
So if you want to check out the second channel, then

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.540
go to 2Veritasium. I'll put a card or something for it up here.
