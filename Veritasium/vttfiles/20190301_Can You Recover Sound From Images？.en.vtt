00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.200
This video was filmed without sound.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.840
Is it possible to use only these images to

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.680
reconstruct the sound? that is can you
hear pictures?

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.280
in this video I'm gonna

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.199
try to demonstrate that it's possible to
get sound from pictures but it's not

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.840
gonna be easy so I'm gonna need some
help.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.480
this episode was sponsored by

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.990
LastPass which allowed me to fly to the
Bay Area to meet with one of my science

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.150
heroes so now on with the video.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.500
How're you doing?

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.960
I'm sorry my place of
my concern is like threw all

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.240
this crap over here.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.760
So this is the experiment that I came up with. -It's like

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.470
a crumpled up ball of tinfoil? -yeah like
if I had a more powerful camera and I

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.190
had like the right lens then you know we
could do something that looks more like

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.190
you're spying on somebody. But we should
be able to demonstrate that you can

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.910
recover like a rhythm or a sound from
you know whatever camera you have.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.229
Now you might think it would be easy to
record sound in video because after all

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.160
sound is just vibrations so the air is
vibrating back and forth and everything

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.119
it hits should vibrate back and forth
too. So you'd think all we need to do is

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.040
video that motion and plot displacement
versus time and then recover the sound.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.380
But it's not that simple because for one
thing I mean these sound vibrations are

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.180
incredibly tiny. They move objects only
about one micrometer and even if you're

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.920
super zoomed in that is way less than a
pixel we're talking a hundredth or a

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.860
thousandth of a pixel. -We're not seeing
something that is at one pixel move to

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.040
an adjacent pixel. You're seeing one
pixel get slightly darker and the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.360
next pixel get slightly brighter. -What
objects work best for recovering sound? -So

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.960
the things that work best are things
that have a lot of damping but are also

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.050
very light so that they move very
readily with changes in the air pressure

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.620
so what are some good examples? 
-well like a bag of chips.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.040
you know the initial

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.800
experiments were very like contrived in
a way. You know we had these objects on

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.500
optical benches we were blasting light
at them

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.780
the sounds were like as loud as we could
make them.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.140
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.280
I figured we'd try to do a rhythm.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.360
This is...

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.660
shave and a haircut

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.640
let's put  that camera on a tripod

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.000
- oh yeah that's I mean that'd be great

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.137
All right, let's give it a shot,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.860
this is the actual clip I recorded and I want you to

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.620
notice two things: first, you can't really
see much motion; and second, there are

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.180
plenty of pixels getting dimmer and
brighter because of image noise. I mean

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.230
it's not a pristine, perfect image so how
do you tell the difference between

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.140
pixels getting brighter and dimmer due
to tiny movements versus noise?

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.980
Essentially you look for edges in the image
and then you say well if the object

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.250
moves by some fraction of a fraction of
a pixel in one particular direction

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.270
then pixels on one side of that edge
will get a little bit brighter pixels

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.880
the other side of that edge will get a
little bit darker. And so basically what

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.270
we do is we sum together all the ones
that are supposed to get brighter and

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.590
subtract all the ones that are supposed
to get darker and then that gives us sort of

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.950
one number right and if you track that
number over time then that gives you an

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.020
estimate of the displacement over time.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.760
This is time but in samples and

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.720
then this is position.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.900
-hmm so what do you do now?

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.830
well we're gonna try to do some

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.440
filtering on that.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.500
it's clipping. You don't say

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:30.620
I mean
it's not much... it's not much but you can

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.460
recognize two of the beats.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.840
This is what
we've recovered from a hundred and

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:43.040
eighty frames per second, which isn't
really a whole lot within the range of

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.340
like audible frequencies so that's why
you know kind of the most we can hope

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.760
for here is a bit of a rhythm

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.600
Now of course the main limiting factor

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.669
is framerate because we can hear sounds
from 20 Hertz to 20,000 Hertz but most

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:01.680
cameras only shoot 30 frames per second
so they miss virtually all of these sound frequencies.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.590
Imagine this is the
motion created by a 30 Hertz sound if

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.610
you try to capture this with a camera at
30 frames per second you would end up

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.260
seeing the object always in the same
position because it's at the same point

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.720
in the wave cycle. So your perception
would be that the object is not moving at all

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.410
So in order to measure a
frequency of sound you actually need to

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.510
sample at least twice that frequency
which is why a lot of music is sampled

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:35.400
at 44 or 48 kilohertz - that's more than
twice as much as the highest sound we can hear.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.390
At any rate if you want to get
a something more intelligible you're

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.900
going to need some higher frame rate
camera.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.800
so we just went to the camera store and
picked up a new camera that should be

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.280
able to shoot a thousand frames per
second or thereabouts.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.060
Is that gonna be enough?

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.680
it'll be enough for something.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.160
Hehehe I love that confidence

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.100
This is one modulation away from dubstep right here.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.449
Just a little bit more of a wump wump

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.580
and then we have the next big track.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.599
I've set it to a thousand frames per second

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.000
now we're talking 
-yeah

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.800
okay

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.460
okay so you have the footage there and

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.500
you're cropping in a bit, tell me about
that.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.690
well we're running this on my

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:34.300
laptop as opposed to the servers that I
had back at MIT and that is gonna mean

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.560
that if we run it on the full video of
my laptop will crash -okay

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.680
so we're gonna crop it and try it on that
- I can see a little bit of motion

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.790
-yeah I mean I think

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.487
that one question is whether that's like
-resonant motion

00:06:47.487 --> 00:06:49.300
yeah well in this case

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.020
would be kind of like the equivalent of
a rocking chair like if the if the foil

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.460
has a like a rocking mode then that's
actually not gonna give us a lot of

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.480
sound information 
-mm-hmm

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.480
Can you tell
whether this is gonna work or not?

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.980
I am optimistic.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.740
I think because I know what I'm
listening for I can hear it in there but

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.500
yeah you've gotta be careful though
really?

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.770
that you're well just gonna be careful

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.120
that you're not like confirmation bias
sure.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.700
let's try that

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.390
that's about 60 Hertz that seems a
little much

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:38.140
okay we're gonna try one more time. We
have basically put the piece of foil on

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:44.500
top of the speaker, we're dialing up the
volume to... 11. -Well I mean it's a shower

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.120
speaker so

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.540
Cool 
So what do you think of that image there?

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.860
it's beautiful, it's gorgeous.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:10.070
it has been like a couple years since
I've looked at this code so I suspect I

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.280
might have forgotten something and I'm
using it wrong but I want to point

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:20.870
something out here, which is that here's
what we recovered and here is here is

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:25.120
the piano roll of the signal that we
sent.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.740
This looks like duh duh to me and

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.980
that's the duhhh yeah yeah

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.560
that's it that is the...

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.290
---dih duh dud din duhhhh din dih 
- yeah okay so let's

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:38.940
see if we can actually get it to hear that

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.540
-We can see it, we just can't hear it

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.080
I think I know what it is.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.720
What is it?

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.380
I don't think my laptop can play those frequencies.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.560
hold on a second let
me get some headphones

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.660
We need real speakers or something.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.500
What do you hear Abe?

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.700
hold on.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:21.040
I hear shave and a haircut two bits

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.180
here, listen this.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.740
All right. 
-here, I'll hold it.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:25.640
thank you.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:32.680
yeah.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.140
and... pitch shift

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.600
[recovered sound of Shave and a haircut, two bits]

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:52.860
yep there you go,
visual microphone. [laughter]

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.740
this was a basic proof

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.890
of concept but Abe showed that with more
powerful equipment he could recover

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.220
human speech from outside soundproof
glass.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.940
Have you ever considered that your

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:21.200
computer is a physical system that gives
off vibrations each key on the keyboard

00:10:21.209 --> 00:10:26.100
produces a unique sound due to its
unique location. In fact, research has

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:31.560
shown that audio recordings of typing
reveal 96% of keystrokes accurately.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.250
Now this portion of the video was sponsored
by LastPass, an app that stores all your

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.670
usernames and passwords so you never
have to type them in. And this prevents

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:42.449
people from stealing your passwords by
say recording audio of your keystrokes

00:10:42.449 --> 00:10:44.500
or just looking over your shoulder.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.410
What's even better is the convenience of

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:50.040
never having to fill in usernames and
passwords or getting locked out again

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.200
With LastPass you don't have to write
remember or reset passwords.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.840
You get unlimited password storage and free
cross-device sync.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:58.740
When you open an app

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.960
or site on your computer or on an iOS or
Android device LastPass fills in your

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:07.589
username and password this saves you
valuable brain space so put your

00:11:07.589 --> 00:11:09.680
passwords on autopilot with LastPass.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.610
Now
something I particularly like is if you

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.000
upgrade to LastPass premium you get
advanced multi-factor authentication and

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.480
it works like magic.
