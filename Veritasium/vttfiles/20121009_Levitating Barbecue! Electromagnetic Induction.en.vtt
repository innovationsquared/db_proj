00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.660
Let's switch it on.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.660
Let's see what it does.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.769
Through this coil of thick wire, we're about
to pass a huge alternating electric current.

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.490
On top is a 1 kg aluminium plate.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.259
So we hear that noise.

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.580
What's that noise?

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:29.100
It's the vibration of the plate, because it's
vibrating at two times the frequency of this

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.100
one.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.100
Woah!

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.100
Woooaaaahhhhhhh!!

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.100
hahaha, how does it do that?

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.100
It's magical

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.100
To find out, I've come to the place where
it all started - The Royal Institution in

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.100
London

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.120
This is the key to Faraday's magnetic lab.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.860
It's amazing that the lock still works.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.719
From the 1870's on this became a store room,
which is why it survived and it survived intact,

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.100
all the joinery giant electromagnet are exactly
the same as Faraday left it.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.130
So this is exactly as Faraday would have had
it.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.130
That's right, yup.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.690
In Faraday's time it was known that electric
current creates a magnetic field, but it remained

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.559
an open question whether the reverse is possible
-- if a magnetic field could generate electric

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:04.930
current.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.160
Faraday answered this question with his most
famous apparatus.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.970
Faraday's electromagnetic induction ring.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.760
Which is this.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.330
In August, 1831 Faraday wrapped two coils
of insulated wire around this iron ring.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.070
But in 1831 you could not go down to your
local electrical hardware shop and ask for

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.230
x hundred meters of insulated wire, you had
to insulate the wire as you went.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.320
So as you pushed and pulled the wire in and
out of the ring you had to insulate it.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.180
It takes 10 working days, which was a huge
investment of time.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.070
But the investment paid off.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.560
When Faraday connected a battery to one of
the coils, he saw a brief pulse of current

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.580
in the other coil.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.000
And when he disconnected the battery, he saw
a pulse of current in the other direction.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.490
He realized that current was induced in the
second coil only when the magnetic field through

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.490
it was changing.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.520
And if they hadn't been wrapped on the same
ring, Faraday may have noticed that the two

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.790
coils repel each other when the current is
induced and that's due to the interaction

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.500
of their magnetic fields.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.450
Which brings us back to this.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.740
Through the bottom coil we are passing a huge
electric current: 800A which alternates in

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.640
direction 900 times per second.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.890
This ensures there will always be a changing
magnetic field above the coil.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.480
Instead of a second coil we're using the Aluminium
plate, but the principle is the same, the

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.230
changing magnetic field induces currents in
the plate that create an opposing magnetic

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.140
field -- so it levitates.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.660
How awesome is that?!

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.170
This current is not only good for levitating
the plate.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.950
It can also make lightbulbs glow.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.950
A gift.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.110
Uh, thank you.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.110
Oh.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.110
That is cool.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.250
Not too close because it will burn the lamps.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.530
Can I put it there?

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.530
Yeah.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.720
And just as current in a toaster element heats
it up, the induced current in the plate dissipates

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.740
its energy as heat.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.230
And some water too
Thank you.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.900
Yeah to see the temperature.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.960
Check out how hot this plate is.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.270
Oh, that is nuts!

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.170
Is this your favorite demo?

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.650
It's a flying BBQ or something

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.450
Tell me this is not the best dinner table
centerpiece.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.650
It levitates, gives you light, and you can
cook on it.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:45.510
and all the while you're demonstrating Faraday's
Law of electromagnetic induction.
