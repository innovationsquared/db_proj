00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
Okay they're about to lock me in here
and then use these electric coils to

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.349
make magnetic fields that rotate. They're
roughly the strength of Earth's magnetic

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.269
field and we'll see if my brain is
picking up on the fact that the magnetic

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.050
field is changing. The whole time I'll
have my eyes closed

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.330
it'll be pitch black in here, basically
no stimuli except for the changing

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.500
magnetic field and I'll keep my head
perfectly still facing forward.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.920
that sound good? 
-yeah gonna take about eight
minutes

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.360
eight minutes perfect okay

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.780
I'm ready when you are

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.390
but before we do this
let's meet the researchers. Can you

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.260
introduce yourself? 
-introduce myself? ah

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.649
my name is Shin Shimojo. I'm a professor

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.180
in neuroscience and experimental
psychology at here Caltech Biology

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.260
Connie you are the first
author here and your paper has just been

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.600
published, when this video goes out.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.760
So what is the setup of the paper how do you set this up?

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.120
So basically we wanted
to see if humans have any brain response

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.280
to a magnetic field.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.780
it has long been recognized that certain

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.310
bird species have a remarkable ability
to find their way home, hence the use of

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.020
homing pigeons to carry messages for us.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.170
their impeccable sense of direction is

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.490
owed in part to their ability to sense
the Earth's magnetic field

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.920
but they are not the only animals that do this

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.970
certain bacteria, bees, salmon, turtles

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.660
rats, dogs, whales, cats in all of them are
known to have magnetic compass.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.540
Dogs, known to poop with their bodies oriented
preferentially north-south have even

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.040
been trained to locate bar magnets

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.250
Given a choice between three containers they

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.160
were much better than chance at
identifying the one containing the

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.420
magnet. In fact, they were much better at
finding a magnet than finding a food

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.720
treat under similar conditions

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.190
Given all
these examples it seems more likely that

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.734
humans should have the ability to detect
magnetic fields.

00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:02.760
And if you're wondering

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.020
how humans could physically pick up the
magnetic fields, consider that magnetite

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.410
crystals have been found in the brain
that closely resembled those of

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.880
magnetically active bacteria

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.530
Myy colleagues
in neuroscience said 'wow this is hard to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.340
believe you know this is impossible'
but lots of biologists and geophysicists

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.120
said well it's a matter of course humans
are not, you know, exceptions among all those

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.440
mammalian species.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.840
But up till now the
evidence has been contradictory and controversial.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.590
So in the early 80s
Robin Baker did some studies where they

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.150
took groups of students and drove them
around in very convoluted routes around

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.460
the English countryside.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.890
And they were
blindfolded and then they would stop the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.200
bus and ask the students to identify
which direction they came from.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.940
So basically 'home' and they got a pretty
significant results from that.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.900
Shortly afterwards maybe a few years afterwards
this study was attempted again at

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.120
Princeton University and they did just a
very similar experiment there and they

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.960
couldn't get significant behavioral results
there.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.200
that's a controversy, lots of

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.739
positive reports and the failure of the
duplication, negative data in neuroscience

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.690
as well so let's step back and then see
if there's any systematic, selective

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.520
response from the brain to the magnetic
field itself not anything associated

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.730
like vestibular thing or visual scene, swinging and stuff like that.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.780
So this is the test chamber, I'll turn on the light

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.160
so this is um our magnetic...

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.200
is that the way we get in
yes

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.840
that's the way you have to crouch in

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.060
So I'm gonna I'm gonna crawl under there.
-Yes and you sit down there...

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.020
hang on a sec hang on this

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.440
is too cool I really like it.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.020
What.. whose
chair is that?

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.360
It just happened to be...
Joe's chair

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.200
Joe's reclining the chair

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.500
and not used for this purpose but it
turned out it's very relaxing

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.380
and the main reason of this cage is to shield the
outside effect for one thing and also

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.660
have a good control over the modified
Faraday cage where electricity is running

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.880
okay, so

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.100
and then there's no sound or vision
or tactile or any other additional

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.770
stimulation because we are tapping into
very subtle response of the brain at the

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.200
subliminal subconscious level.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.810
It doesn't
block the Earth's magnetic field. The Earth's

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.350
magnetic field goes straight through
this and that's actually sort of what we

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.550
want because inside the chamber we're
not trying to override the Earth's field

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.050
we're just trying to redirect it just to
add a little bit of field here and here

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.630
remove a little bit there and by doing
that we can smoothly move the field back

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.460
and forth and move it in a way that
relates to how someone might experience

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.380
the field as they're sort of moving you
know around outside

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.340
so that's essentially what you're simulating in
here

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.720
yes 
-is you're making it as though

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.040
my head is swiveling around in the
Earth's magnetic field

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.220
yes except that

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.030
if you actually doing it in the real
world then your vestibular system is

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.610
also sending signals. We are not
interested in contamination

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.750
from vestibular signals so we would like to
generate artificially that kind of

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:25.340
situation like this, however eliminating
any other sensory modalities such as vestibular.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.820
Can I hop in there and just
have a look?

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.640
oh yeah, go ahead
of course - okay

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.980
I mean I feel like for

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:43.800
my job I have been in more weird
soundproof boxes than most people

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.580
These black coils here, do these create
the magnetic field?

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.460
No, so those are for a different experiment

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.360
so the magnet coils are actually these
things.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.500
Those are the magnetic coils

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.840
And you can see there's four of these square
coils -yeah- in all three directions and

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:07.229
this is a nested three axis coil set and
it's designed to create a magnetic field

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:12.000
in any direction inside the chamber
and in the center of the chamber where

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.840
your head and torso is going to be.
mm-hmm

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.590
it's designed to create a uniform

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.900
field so a field with no gradients or
curves in it.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.500
I've brought a compass and

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.449
so I can just see if the magnetic field
is changing, what's gonna happen when I

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:28.920
sit in this room.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.793
okay that was a pretty
dramatic shift.

00:06:32.793 --> 00:06:33.800
So there will be two

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.610
kinds of rotations one is clockwise and
one is counterclockwise and as a control

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.110
on some trials the magnetic field won't
change at all. So we can compare on

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.860
trials what happens after the field
rotation versus trials where no field rotated.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.520
so this is the sort of thing
that I'll be experiencing but in the dark?

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.320
Yep.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.560
Now we're gonna want you to use
your left hand to hold it here 'cause it's

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.600
easier than the front the cap yep.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.670
On this cap there are 64 electrodes

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.120
which will pick up the electrical
activity of my brain

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.660
and you're sure this isn't just to make people look
stupid? - Oh, no, no, no

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.000
When you're awake with your eyes

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.360
closed the dominant signal is called the
alpha wave.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.480
In most people it occurs

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.200
around 10 Hertz.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.860
These little squiggles
right here they're happening at around 10

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.860
times per second, these are the alpha waves

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.560
We are measuring your alpha wave which is known to be an

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.240
indicator of relaxing and sometimes even
drowsy but not sleeping

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:33.000
and then when you notice something like in vision or
audition or touch your alpha wave is

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.320
suppressed and that is the signature of
a brain detecting sensory signal and

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.800
moving attention towards it.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.520
So the goal of
this experiment is to determine if a

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.620
magnetic field rotation causes the
amplitude of alpha waves to drop.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.380
I'm about to go into the cage

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.880
I'm gonna turn off the light. And then we
just do this with a stool

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.680
turn off all

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.260
the lights in the room and we close the
doors.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.160
and throughout the experiment I'll be

00:08:18.169 --> 00:08:21.980
listening in and watching the video
for safety reasons

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.320
Can you hear me?

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.140
Yes I can.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.700
I'm setting up
the experiment. Um, we'll be starting shortly.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.360
Just wait for the 'ding dings'

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.100
The experiment is starting, you can see that's

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:41.420
our starting point. In terms of
direction, it will

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:45.580
vary from
two preset values

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.880
yeah, so you can see there, that was a field rotation

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.040
This is like one of the more
glamorous

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.280
ahhhh...there we go.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.880
That's what I was not meant to hit. Thank you.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.300
Sorry about that.
I could see that happening.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.220
You could see that coming. Man, I was thinking about saying

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:07.713
something to the camera.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.240
I can't wait to see
the results though.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.360
this is a section of

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.709
my raw EEG results. You can see that
every three seconds the field was

00:09:15.709 --> 00:09:19.910
rotated either clockwise counter
clockwise or it was fixed, meaning it

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.899
didn't change. Now it's impossible to
draw conclusions just by looking at this

00:09:23.899 --> 00:09:27.800
so the scientists average over all the
trials in the different conditions and

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.660
plot the alpha power over all the
electrodes.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:32.899
This is a recording from

00:09:32.899 --> 00:09:37.310
someone who is particularly sensitive to
changes in the magnetic field. As I play

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:41.540
this, watch how the clockwise and
counterclockwise responses compare to

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.900
the fixed field result.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.200
the recording
starts before a rotation.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.560
The magnetic stimulus takes place,

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:54.000
and now observe the 
post stimulus response, particularly for counterclockwise

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.560
for this subject the
counter clockwise rotation resulted in a

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.270
clear decrease in alpha power of at
least three decibels shown by the dark

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:09.160
blue color. This corresponds to a
decrease in alpha power by around 50%

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:14.180
Now, here are my results. After the
magnetic stimulus my response to

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:19.000
counterclockwise is clearly not as
pronounced.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.080
But over time for clockwise rotations my alpha power is reduced.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.160
I was told I was neither the most
sensitive to magnetic fields nor the

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.980
least sensitive, I was somewhere in the
middle.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.980
So the conclusion is that our

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:42.800
brains have ability to sense magnetic field
change but it's implicit and subliminal

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.500
it's non-conscious part of the brain.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.440
This is just the first step to make sure

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:53.300
that it's not theoretically impossible
that our ancestors might have utilized

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.560
this ability for their navigation. Even the
modem people like ourselves may

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.990
potentially have it. This will open up
the window for the next

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:06.480
stage research as to how we could bring
it to the consciousness, how could we

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.740
strengthen them, and how could we utilize
it.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.780
As yet it's unclear if anyone can

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:15.750
actually make use of this sense
consciously or subconsciously to help

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.529
them navigate, but the study's authors
point out that a surprising number of

00:11:19.529 --> 00:11:25.020
human languages lack terms like front
back left and right and instead use

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.940
cardinal directions, North, South, East and
West.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.720
Native speakers of such languages

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.700
would refer to a nearby tree as being to
their north rather than being in front

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.570
of them. Individuals who've been raised
from an early age within a linguistic

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:43.649
social and spatial framework using
cardinal reference cues might have made

00:11:43.649 --> 00:11:49.020
associative links with geomagnetic
sensory cues to aid in daily life.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:54.140
In other words, people from such cultures
may be conscious of their magnetoreception.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.060
They would be very
interesting to test.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.110
But if it turns out

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.680
that this sense is no longer functional
in humans, just a relic from our

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.920
ancestors, it would be interesting to
consider why we lost it.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.920
Maybe modern world humans don't need it - that's
one explanation. Another explanation is

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:16.589
we are surrounded so much and exposed so
much to artificially created strong

00:12:16.589 --> 00:12:23.160
magnetic fields, starting from the
airplane cabinet, headphones, some younger

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.400
people are wearing this for 10 hours per day.
including MRI scanner too.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:33.080
So it's possible our internal compass may be a
victim of our modern technology.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:38.850
This study does not show that magnetic fields
have some kind of special influence on

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:45.320
you, that they don't cure disease, they
don't make you smarter.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:51.820
you can't communicate telepathically or something
through them

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:52.920
So these are the types of

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.920
emails that Connie does not want to
receive just so, just so everyone's

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.060
clear in case you've got sort of a crazy
idea.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.720
my hair still looks stupid, In case

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.610
you have a crazy idea for what to do
with magnetic fields and the human brain

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.340
this this study does not support that.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.200
no
it does not support that.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:14.140
It only supports that the human brain
and pick up on the physical stimulus of

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.900
the Earth's magnetic field

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:17.860
yup

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.580
Which, in itself is a super cool finding.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:26.230
it is a super cool finding, it's like the
basis for for future research because

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.580
you know you can't have any behavior
without some kind of something going on

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.600
in your brain.
