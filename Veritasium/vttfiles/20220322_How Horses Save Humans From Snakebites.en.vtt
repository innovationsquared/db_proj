00:00:02.404 --> 00:00:03.713
- [Zac] Are you all
right to grab the back end?

00:00:03.713 --> 00:00:05.147
- [Derek] Uh, well, not at the moment.

00:00:05.147 --> 00:00:06.677
- Not yet.

00:00:06.677 --> 00:00:07.510
Get him up.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.490
You gotta lock him in.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.830
A scratch from this
species will knock you.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.000
- Knock you down...

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.833
Could kill you? Or...

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:17.193
- Oh definitely, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:17.193 --> 00:00:17.923
- Okay.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.640
So I am back in Australia,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.740
and, of course, I'm a reminded

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.170
that everything in this
country is trying to kill you,

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.020
particularly snakes and spiders,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.230
and here at the Australian Reptile Park

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.440
they actually milk snakes and spiders

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.260
so they can use their
venom to make antivenom

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.490
and save lives.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.397
Let's go see how they do it.

00:00:36.397 --> 00:00:37.460
- All right, so come on in, man.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.540
This is without a doubt

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.560
the most dangerous room in the country.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.130
You're currently
surrounded floor to ceiling

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.193
with venomous snakes.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.400
- And the only thing
that keeps the snakes in

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.320
is those little locks?

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.635
- Yeah, just the little
locks and the thin glass.

00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:57.635
(suspenseful music)

00:00:58.904 --> 00:01:00.100
- [Derek] Did a snake actually do that?

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.933
- Yeah.

00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:01.766
So a kid was tapping on the glass.

00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:02.599
I told him not to,

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:03.610
his parents are like nah, it's all good.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.710
And I'm like, don't tap on the glass, man.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.740
The snake goes, (thumps fist)

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.335
The kid ran out with the
smelling of a crap, so yeah.

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:10.440
(Derek laughs)

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.550
- For real?
- Yeah, oh yeah.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.952
He went (mimics a kid screaming)

00:01:12.952 --> 00:01:14.667
He went screaming out the room.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.460
In Australia we lose one
to three people per annum

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.630
to snake bite.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.040
Internationally estimates by
the World Health Organization

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.203
is 120,000.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.550
So not only do we have some of the best

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.480
antivenom products
anywhere on the planet,

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.610
but we have a federally
funded antivenom program,

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.160
which means no matter who you are,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.560
you get antivenom for free.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.030
So we'll probably play
with a big coastal taipan

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.863
to start with.

00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:37.696
- Yeah.

00:01:37.696 --> 00:01:39.700
So why are we starting big?

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.780
- Oh we may as well.
(Derek laughs)

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.820
- You tell me what I need to do.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.653
- Righty-O

00:01:42.653 --> 00:01:43.930
I'm just gonna grab a vial from behind you

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:44.763
'cause obviously we use

00:01:44.763 --> 00:01:46.660
only the most highly scientific
pieces of equipment here

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.493
at the Reptile Park.

00:01:47.493 --> 00:01:48.326
- Got it.

00:01:48.326 --> 00:01:49.159
- It's our shot glass.
- Beautiful.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.550
- And I might even get
you to hold that for me

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.383
- Great.
- For a second.

00:01:51.383 --> 00:01:52.960
This is one of our big boys.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.460
Hopefully he's in a good mood.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.100
As you can see, quite a large individual.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.023
- Wow.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.623
- Now what we're gonna do.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.373
- Yeah.

00:02:04.373 --> 00:02:05.206
- Is pin him.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.275
Now, wait, wait, wait.

00:02:08.275 --> 00:02:09.108
Get him up.

00:02:09.108 --> 00:02:09.941
Righty-O

00:02:09.941 --> 00:02:10.774
There you go, you hold that,

00:02:10.774 --> 00:02:11.607
I'll take that vial off you.

00:02:11.607 --> 00:02:12.969
- Okay.

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.160
(Nervous laughter)

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.888
This feels absurd.

00:02:16.888 --> 00:02:17.721
- There we go.

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:18.880
As you can see, he's keen on the killing.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.040
Now snakes aren't stupid.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.950
He doesn't wanna bite the jar,

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:21.830
he wants to bite me.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.393
Finger is the target.

00:02:25.488 --> 00:02:27.500
(Laughs hysterically)

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.333
There we go.

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:30.500
- Oh my goodness.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.020
That was a lot of venom
delivered very quickly.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.180
- Yeah, they're not mucking around.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.740
- Wow.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.710
- Now what we'll do is we'll
actually give his venom glands

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.543
a little bit of a massage.

00:02:39.543 --> 00:02:41.470
So what you would consider his cheeks,

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.190
give them a little bit of a roll,

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.560
see if we can get an extra drop or two

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.740
'cause every drop matters.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.130
- [Derek] Uh-huh.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.460
- Now, because my hand's
starting to cramp up,

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.293
I'm gonna put him away.

00:02:50.293 --> 00:02:52.170
So I'll get you guys to jump back for me.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.530
And this is the sketchy bit.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.363
- Yeah.

00:02:54.363 --> 00:02:55.600
- When you get him out, you got the hook,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.530
when you're putting him back,

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.730
it's just who's quicker.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.273
Ready?

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:05.519
Two.

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.820
(cage door shuts)

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.760
- Are your hands trembling a little bit?

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.950
- Yeah, every time.
- Look at that

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.680
So how much venom do you actually need

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.180
to make antivenom?

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.380
- [Zac] About 15.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.509
- [Derek] 15 snakes to make
one vial of antivenom?

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:20.090
- Yeah.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.050
- [Derek] Venom evolved from saliva

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.690
and it's used primarily for
catching and digesting prey.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.370
Each species of snake
has a different venom

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.780
tailored to the specific
animals they hunt.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.750
The venom was originally squirted

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.370
into a snake's mouth by the back teeth,

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.310
and to this day,

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.800
almost 2/3 of all snakes are rear fanged.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.960
- Now why the rear tooth, you might ask?

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.430
Well, it's because the venom gland itself

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.720
is actually behind the snake's eye.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.320
So the shortest distance for a duct

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.120
is directly downwards to
the back end of the top jaw.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.300
- [Derek] In some species,

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.230
evolutionary pressures caused
the fangs to move closer

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.280
and closer to the front of the jaw,

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.040
improving the snake's ability
to catch and kill prey.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.600
While the location of
the fangs was evolving,

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.670
so were the fangs themselves.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.320
They started off as smooth ordinary teeth

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.030
with venom flowing down the outside,

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.210
but over time,

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.560
some snake lineages evolved
a groove in each fang

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.710
to channel the flow of venom.

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:24.940
In some species, the groove
became deeper and deeper

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.130
eventually closing in
to form a hollow tube,

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.370
and now the teeth literally
inject venom into prey.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.920
But this is not the norm.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.650
Only 1/7 of the world's
snakes have hollow fangs,

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.660
but, of course, almost all the
venomous snakes in Australia

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.340
do have hollow fangs,

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.420
so we set up this macro
shot to take a closer look.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.720
- This one's rolling.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.680
That one's rolling.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.657
We're ready when you're.

00:04:48.657 --> 00:04:49.724
- We're ready.

00:04:49.724 --> 00:04:50.557
Perfect.

00:04:50.557 --> 00:04:54.474
- All right, everyone's ready?
- Yep.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.920
Wow.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.080
It's got like jets

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.980
Jets of venom coming out.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.700
Has this guy not been
milked in a while or?

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.313
- Yeah, it's been a little while.

00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:11.910
(upbeat music)

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:12.743
Not only do we have

00:05:12.743 --> 00:05:14.940
some of the most toxic
snakes on the planet here,

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.350
we also selectively breed them

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.470
for the production of antivenom.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.790
They're bred to produce more venom

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:20.980
than their wild counterparts.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.880
So some of our coastal taipans
are producing five, six

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.380
nearly seven times what
their wild counterpart would,

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.650
and that's just from selective breeding.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.020
You find your two most psychotic ones,

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.853
you put them together,

00:05:29.853 --> 00:05:31.851
you hope for the best and
the absolute worst comes out.

00:05:31.851 --> 00:05:32.684
(Laughs)

00:05:32.684 --> 00:05:34.430
So keeps you on your toes.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.450
- That sounds horrendous.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:36.610
So you're saying that

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.840
these are the most venomous
snakes in the world,

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.880
and then you have bred
them to be more venomous?

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.987
- Yeah, they're super snakes.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.120
A scratch from any of these
animals could kill you.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.630
And some of these snakes are giving 4.5,

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.630
4.9 grams of venom per bite,

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.660
which is just stupid amounts.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.910
- We spoke to venom
expert, Timothy Jackson

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.300
who argued these snakes produce more venom

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.910
because they are regularly
milked, unlike wild snakes.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.370
Either way, the snakes in
this room contain more venom

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.150
than virtually any others on earth.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.750
- We house the second, the
third, the fourth, the fifth,

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.440
and about the 12th or 13th most toxic,

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.690
depending on who you talk to.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.410
- [Derek] One bite from a King Cobra

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.940
contains enough venom to kill 13,000 mice,

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.040
and we know this because
of a study from 1979

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.180
that tested the venoms of 25
different species of snake

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.790
on lab mice.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.170
From this, we can estimate

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.090
that the venom from one King Cobra bite

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.700
could kill around four humans,

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.980
though to be precise,

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.830
we'd have to say four human-sized rodents

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.650
because thankfully, no one's
tested these venoms on humans.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:42.930
And by this measure,

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.750
the most venomous snake in the
world is the inland taipan,

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.620
which conveniently lives
in the middle of Australia.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.160
A bite from the inland taipan

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.520
has enough venom to kill
half a million mice,

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.910
or more than 100 humans.

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.330
So yeah, why not milk that one next?

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.340
- So the next one, we're gonna
step it up another notch.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.130
So this is the inland taipan,

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.510
also known as the fierce snake,

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.890
the most toxic land snake on the planet.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.320
These guys have the ability
with one drop of venom

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.350
to knock over 100 adult humans.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.490
So stupidly toxic.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.720
So quite a lot smaller

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.240
than the last couple
of animals we've used,

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.130
but makes up for it in toxicity.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.090
Very, very quick and very
naughty when he wants to be,

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.840
but an absolutely gorgeous pattern.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.180
You can grab that bit for me, mate.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.013
- Yes.

00:07:28.013 --> 00:07:29.797
- I'm gonna grab this
vial from behind you.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:31.523
And as you can see,

00:07:31.523 --> 00:07:32.820
he's very keen on the killing.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:36.923
There we go.

00:07:36.923 --> 00:07:38.770
- [Derek] That is extraordinary.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.283
The most venomous snake in the world.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.311
- Just incredible animals, aren't they?

00:07:46.311 --> 00:07:48.922
(cage door shuts)

00:07:48.922 --> 00:07:49.947
(laughs)

00:07:49.947 --> 00:07:50.780
- [Derek] That was quick.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.130
- Yeah, those ones make me proper nervous.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:52.963
I don't know about you guys,

00:07:52.963 --> 00:07:53.796
but I'm sweating.

00:07:53.796 --> 00:07:55.400
- [Derek] Can you see the hands?

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.390
- The moment I stop doing
that after a milking

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:59.111
is the day I quit.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.250
- [Derek] The concept of
the most venomous snake

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:03.520
is complicated

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.120
because snakes evolved
their venom specifically

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.570
for potency against their usual prey,

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.890
in turn, their prey evolved
resistance to their venom.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.780
The honey badger, for example,

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.850
is almost completely
immune to Cobra venom.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.260
So the lethality of a
bite depends on the snake,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.130
the animal that got bitten,

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.590
and the amount of venom injected.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:27.820
The reason scientists test
different venoms on lab mice

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.630
is to get an estimate of
the amount of antivenom

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.350
that would be required
to neutralize a bite.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.370
Snake venom is lethal to us

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.560
because we are closely
related to snakes' main prey,

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.590
rodents.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.590
Rodents and primates split
on the evolutionary tree

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.000
only 75 million years ago,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.430
so we share a lot of the same biology,

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.710
from the structure of our cells
to the way our blood clots,

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.240
to how our nerves send signals.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:58.100
- Venoms typically target very
conserved molecular pathways

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.740
that exist across maybe all vertebrates

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:05.113
or maybe even the entire
tree of life in some cases.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.460
- [Derek] There are four ways

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.130
that snake venom can kill you.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:11.840
It can be neurotoxic,

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.180
damaging to your nervous system and brain

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.380
by interfering with neurotransmitters,

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.250
the signaling chemicals
that go between neurons.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.098
It can be hemotoxic,

00:09:21.098 --> 00:09:21.931
thinning out your blood,

00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:23.770
preventing wounds from healing

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.830
and causing internal bleeding.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.280
It does this by disturbing
the delicate machinery

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.480
of the blood coagulation system.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.710
Venom can also be cytotoxic,

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.300
attacking cells, leading
to severe blisters,

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.730
necrosis and cell death.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.760
It can also be myotoxic,

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.080
destroying muscles and causing paralysis.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.050
The worst part is that snake venoms

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.680
can contain up to 200 compounds.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.450
Most venoms contain a
combination of neurotoxic,

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:54.640
hemotoxic, cytotoxic
and myotoxic proteins.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.890
This is what makes snake
bites so difficult to treat.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.960
It's not just one toxin
you're trying to neutralize,

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.223
but dozens all working
together to try to kill you.

00:10:05.817 --> 00:10:07.191
- Come on.

00:10:07.191 --> 00:10:08.024
Good boy.

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:09.024
There we go.

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:14.220
I've been at the park
for 10 years this year.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:18.160
I've been running this
facility for 7 1/2, eight.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.560
- Have you ever been bitten?

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.523
- Yeah, so about 3 1/2
years ago, I got a scratch.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:29.000
One finger got nicked.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.040
That was 36 hours in ICU

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.280
and eight of those were on a resus bay.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.785
So very, very serious.

00:10:34.785 --> 00:10:36.323
- [Derek] And what was
that experience like?

00:10:36.323 --> 00:10:37.200
- That was crappy.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.033
As it turns out,

00:10:38.033 --> 00:10:40.060
I'm highly allergic to
antivenom, which is not ideal.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.380
I started swelling up looking
like the Elephant Man.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.060
So then they whack you with adrenaline

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.420
to cancel out the anaphylaxis

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.210
and then they have to
give you more anti-venom,

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:48.970
more adrenaline, more
anti-venom, more adrenaline,

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.300
more anti-venom, more adrenaline.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.095
And thankfully, I only needed the one,

00:10:52.095 --> 00:10:53.370
but it was like the best case scenario,

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.610
he didn't chew, he didn't bite,

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:56.540
but literally just a scratch.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.610
- [Derek] So what is antivenom exactly?

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.483
and how was it invented?

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:04.840
In 1870, a British military
doctor, Edward Nicholson

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.780
was stationed in Burma,

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.360
and as he watched the
local snake handlers,

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.520
he noticed something strange.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.660
They would from time to time

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.360
deliberately get Cobras to bite them

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.200
in what he considered a form of tattooing.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.480
Nicholson reasoned that
they were intentionally

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.400
exposing their bodies to the venom

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.990
to develop an immune response.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:28.520
He observed that the older snake handlers

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.420
were less affected by accidental bites

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.670
than the younger ones.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.533
So this dangerous practice
seemed to be paying off.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.060
20 years later in Saigon,

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.070
a French medical researcher
named Albert Calmette

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.250
was vaccinating local
residents against smallpox.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:48.470
When he became aware of
the threat posed by Cobras,

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:49.930
he wondered if it was possible

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.670
to make a vaccine for snake bites.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.160
Back in Paris, he tried injecting rabbits

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.660
with a tiny amount of Cobra venom

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:01.130
starting with just .03 milligrams,

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.850
but each week, he
injected the rabbits again

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.310
slowly increasing the dose.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:07.860
And after eight months of this,

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.050
the rabbits were receiving

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:12.090
35 milligrams of Cobra venom at a time,

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:16.280
that is 15 times the normal
lethal dose in rabbits,

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.010
but they were still perfectly healthy.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.760
The rabbits' immune systems
had developed antibodies

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.680
to neutralize the venom.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.300
So you can be vaccinated
against snake bites

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.570
just as you can against disease,

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:29.960
but who wants to be vaccinated

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.280
against all different types of snakes

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.070
just in case one bites you?

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:35.810
It would be better, Calmette reasoned,

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:39.650
if you could administer
antibodies after a bite.

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:42.510
So he drew blood from a
venom resistant rabbit

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.920
and isolated the serum which
contains the antibodies,

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.430
and then he injected
it into another rabbit

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.110
that had never been exposed to venom.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.010
When he subsequently injected it

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:55.530
with twice the lethal dose of Cobra venom,

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:57.860
the rabbit was just fine.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:01.680
Immunity had been transferred
from one rabbit to another.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.050
This was the first antivenom,

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:07.710
or as the Frenchman, Calmette
called it, antivenin,

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:11.260
which is why my phone always
makes that auto-correction.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.960
To this day, antivenoms are
made in much the same way.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.150
At the Reptile Park,

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.230
they collect and freeze the venom.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:19.710
It's sent off to be diluted

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:24.000
and injected into a donor
animal, usually a horse.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.610
Horses are used because of their size.

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.390
After increasing the dose
over a period of months,

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.860
the horse builds up immunity to the venom,

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.580
and then it's blood is drawn

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.620
and the antibodies are isolated.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.990
Only the plasma is taken,

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.860
the red blood cells are
returned to the horse.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:44.670
Those horse antibodies are
the life saving antivenom.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.700
Antivenom works for the
same reason venom works,

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.830
because of our shared evolutionary history

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:51.350
with other mammals.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.300
The antibodies produced by horses

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.080
are very similar to the
ones produced by humans,

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.910
so they bind to toxic
compounds and neutralize them

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:00.960
even in our bodies.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.200
But this way of making
antivenom has downsides.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.310
Collecting the venom is dangerous,

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.430
many donor animals are involved,

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:12.070
and some people are allergic to antivenom.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:14.190
Scientists are now
exploring the possibility

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:17.960
of producing antivenom using
genetically modified bacteria.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.410
They would produce the specific antibodies

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:23.670
needed to neutralize
each toxin in a venom,

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:27.670
but for now, this is the
way antivenom is made.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:28.503
How's your arm?

00:14:28.503 --> 00:14:29.336
- Yeah, it's a bit sore.

00:14:29.336 --> 00:14:30.350
The shoulder is a bit tender.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.050
- [Derek] The work Zac
and others like him do

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:37.140
saves countless lives
all around the world.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.750
- If you're up here for fame and fortune,

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:41.180
and oh, look how tough
I am milking snakes,

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.013
you don't last long.

00:14:42.013 --> 00:14:44.060
You get chewed on and you
go, oh, this is not for me.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.560
If you're up here because
you love the animals

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.393
and this is an opportunity

00:14:46.393 --> 00:14:48.290
to not only work with
the animals you love,

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.850
but to actively be a part of saving lives.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:52.710
Like I'm not smart enough to be a doctor,

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:53.890
I'll put that out there straight away,

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:55.663
but I can swing a snake pretty good.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:05.200
- Hey, milking snakes is
a very hands-on activity,

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.670
and so is learning with this
video's sponsor, Brilliant.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:10.340
Brilliant is a website and app designed

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.700
to get you thinking deeply
about science, mathematics

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.030
and computer science.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:16.680
They do this using highly
curated problem sets

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.090
and interactive puzzles.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:20.390
For example, their course
on probability fundamentals

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:21.630
is excellent.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.410
Now I've made a video
before on Bayes' theorem,

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:25.340
but in this course,

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.370
you go through the reasoning
behind it step by step.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:29.830
Using interactive visuals,

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.090
you solve real world problems,

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.290
and I think they make the
lesson much more memorable

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:36.750
and they demystify Bayes' formula.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.610
If you really wanna understand something,

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:40.370
you have to try it out for yourself,

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.070
answer questions and
learn from your mistakes,

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:45.090
that's what Brilliant allows you to do.

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:46.820
There are so many courses to choose from

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.460
in the areas of math,
science, and computer science,

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:50.780
and for viewers of this video,

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.060
Brilliant is offering 20% off
on annual premium subscription

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.020

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.050
Just go to brilliant.org/veritasium

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.140
I will put that link
down in the description.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.290
So I wanna thank Brilliant
for supporting Veritasium

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.343
and I wanna thank you for watching.
