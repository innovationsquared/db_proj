00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.159
Is our food becoming less nutritious?

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.450
Many people claim that the nutrient content in our food has been decreasing over the decades.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.500
But is this really true, and should we be worried?

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.800
A study published in 2004 looked at 43 different common garden crops,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.100
and how their nutritional value had changed between 1950 and 1999.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.578
Now, what they found was that on average, the protein content of those plants decreased by about 6%,

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.190
Vitamin C decreased 15%, and vitamin B2 by a whopping 38 percent.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.259
They also noticed declines and minerals like iron and calcium.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.300
Now, there is some debate around the numbers because, well,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.400
How well could we really have measured those nutrients back in 1950?

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:57.059
But there is still this concern that the food we're eating today might be less nutritious than, say, the same vegetables 50 years ago.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.590
Several other recent studies also suggest a pattern is emerging.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.540
So if we're witnessing a nutrient collapse, what's causing it?

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.980
One factor that many people point to is depletion of the soils.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.799
Given plants to draw their nutrients up from the soil,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.760
intense farming practices were thought to be the cause of nutrient depletion.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.100
If you look at micronutrients, things like minerals, well, there are decreasing levels in plants.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.700
But, farmers have always put a lot of effort into maintaining their soils,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.100
and using fertilizers to ensure that the plants have all the nutrients they need,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.000
which makes that argument less convincing.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.480
We're still getting big plants, and they wouldn't grow that well if they didn't have the nutrients they need in the soil.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.249
So why else might nutrients be declining?

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.400
One possibility is that it's selective breeding.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:03.200
If you look at crops like corn today, they're barely recognizable when you compare them to their ancestors,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.200
the wild corn from which these were bred.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.690
Basically since the advent of agriculture,

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.440
we have been breeding our food crops for higher yields, for resistance to pests and changes in the climate.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.500
And, by and large, we've been successful. Crops are now bigger and grow faster than ever before.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.900
But are they more nutritious?

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.080
Maybe we've accidentally been breeding the nutrition out of our foods in pursuit of other objectives.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.000
It's tough to really assess how big of a factor selective breeding is,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.550
because we can't easily compare this produce to the same produce a hundred years ago or a thousand years ago.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.990
So we need something else to be able to determine whether it's selective breeding causing this decrease or something else.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.800
What would be really helpful would be a plant that has never been selectively bred.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.950
Where would you find one like that? Well, this is where weeds come in handy.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.589
In North America, there is a wild flower called goldenrod.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.500
It's an important source of protein for bees, but not humans.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:22.900
And so, it has remained wild, or untouched by selective breeding, but how would you know what goldenrod was like 100 or 200 years ago?

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.700
The Smithsonian Institute have been keeping hundreds of samples of goldenrod dating all the way back to 1842.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.750
Using these samples and samples they collected in 2014,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:43.029
scientists were able to compare modern goldenrod with goldenrod from over a hundred years ago, and the results were astounding.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:51.200
They found that there was a 30% decrease in the amount of protein in the goldenrod pollen over that period.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.040
If it's not selective breeding,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.639
what else has contributed to goldenrod becoming less nutritious over the last 150 years or so?

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:07.300
One rather surprising idea was that carbon dioxide could play a vital role.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:17.000
[Old time video]: Here we see in cross-section air with its particles of carbon dioxide gas enters the plant and makes its way into every living cell.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.799
CO2 is like plant food in the air. It basically increases the growth of all plants.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.600
Over the last couple of centuries, the level of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased a lot,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.200
from about 280 parts per million to over 400 parts per million today.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.700
Now, that might not sound like a lot,

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.100
but if you're thinking of it as plant food, we're talking about an increase by almost 50%,

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.900
and we can see the impact from space.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.679
It's called the greening of the planet.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.900
Scientists have been tracking the impact of CO2 on plants via experiments called FACE,

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.500
which stands for Free Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.400
Their experiments run by injecting more CO2 into the area where plant crops are grown,

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:11.800
and they find that wheat, barley, rice and potatoes; they will grow faster if there's more CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:18.500
But here's the thing. They don't necessarily become more nutritious, they simply put on more carbs.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.779
In other studies conducted in Japan and China,

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:28.600
scientists pumped carbon dioxide into rice crops to simulate the kind of CO2 concentrations expected in 50 years time.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.510
On average, protein levels fell by 10 percent iron by 8 percent and zinc by 5 percent,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.979
But a lower concentration of nutrients doesn't necessarily correlate with a decline in the plant's nutrient contents.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.500
It's called the dilution effect.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.339
So what does all this mean for us?

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.949
Well, by 2050 scientists estimate that up to a hundred and fifty million people in the developing world

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.770
may be on the verge of protein deficiency, due to the decreasing levels of protein in their staple foods.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.339
So does that mean we should all be taking vitamins and supplements?

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.300
Well, no. At least, not yet.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:13.009
Because the nutrient declines are small enough that you should still be able to get everything you need from a well balanced diet,

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.500
Including plenty of fruits and veggies.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:23.100
But, the increasing levels of CO2 and the dilution effect may be exacerbating the obesity epidemic.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.169
The thinking goes like this:

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:29.449
We feel full, or satiated, when we've consumed a certain amount of protein.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.410
So if the protein levels are going down

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:37.800
We may have to eat more food, more carbohydrates, and more fats to achieve the same level of protein.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.479
And that may make us fatter.

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:45.900
While this is still a contentious theory what is becoming increasingly clear is that the changing atmosphere,

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.479
specifically the rising level of CO2, is changing the food we eat.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.200
Hey, I hope you enjoyed that.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.400
I made this video as kind of a companion piece to my new feature-length documentary called Vitamania,

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.200
all about the sense and nonsense of vitamins and supplements.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.200
You can watch that documentary if you haven't already by clicking right here.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:17.459
It's available globally, except for France and Germany because it'll be on your TV on September 25th. I'm really sorry about that,

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:25.700
but I really appreciate you making it possible for me to make both YouTube videos and Big international TV documentaries.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.949
It's been a lot of fun and really, I couldn't have done it without you.
