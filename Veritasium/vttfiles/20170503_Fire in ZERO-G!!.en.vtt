00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
I'm about to experience weightlessness

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.380
for the first time.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.760
Oh my god! Oh my god

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.500
that is so strange  *Oh my god*

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.760
this is totally freaky

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.760
this is way better than I expected

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.540
I'm just gonna say that right now

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.560
*um*

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm going up to the ceiling

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.400
and here we are.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.580
I am ridiculously excited, because behind me

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.640
is a Zero-G plane.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.980
I'm in France, I was invited here by

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.220
by the youtuber Bruce.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.680
This is Bruce, Diana physics girl.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.480
We are going - flying some parabolas-  we're going into Zero-G

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.480
It's gonna be awesome! C'mon

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.340
The principle behind weightlessness is pretty simple,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.780
the plane and everything inside it just need to accelerate towards the earth

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.040
at the same rate as a freely falling object in a vacuum.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.040
That is 9.8 meters per second squared

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.540
So, you can think of your body as this pen, and the plane as this bottle

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.380
and when it's freely falling, there's no contact force between the pen and the bottle,

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.560
and so the pen feels weightless.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.920
So you might think the way to do this

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.200
is just to put the plane into a dive.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.460
But that's not actually how it works.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.480
Instead, the plane starts climbing

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.700
at a steadily increasing angle.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.180
With no windows inside,

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.300
it's impossible to tell that this is happening,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.460
and all you feel is pressed into the floor with a force

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.480
1.8 times your body weight.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.820
This is because the plane's acceleration is

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.720
directed upwards and perpendicular to

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.640
the floor, and it makes standing very

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.860
difficult - not only are you nearly twice

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.350
as heavy, all the blood drains from your

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.390
head and into your feet - which made me

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.200
pretty dizzy. -Ah!

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.060
Haha! So weak... ugh -Lying on your back is much

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.190
more comfortable, and we're advised not

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.480
to move our heads around and look

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.230
straight ahead,

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.690
because in hyper-G our vestibular system

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.300
is hypersensitive to movement, which can

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.400
lead to motion sickness. And that's why

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.290
this is sometimes called the vomit comet.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.950
-I kind of like this. -It is fun, feels like

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.050
someone lying on you -Yeah -Not like that.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.420
Once the plane is climbing at about 50

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.020
degrees,

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.060
the engines are ramped down, and the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.580
plane is put into a parabolic trajectory.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.500
It's at this point that you start

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.210
experiencing weightlessness. -I can feel

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.420
myself getting lighter... oh that is such a

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.030
strange feeling... that is so weird...

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.040
-The plane and you are still moving

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.600
upward, but you are accelerating downward.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.480
-There's Diana, she's the physics girl

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.220
Then the plane peaks, and start
speeding up again towards the Earth.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.280
The whole time the plane is
accelerating toward Earth

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.040
with the same acceleration as a
free falling object in vacuum,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.920
the pilots have to very skillfully
adjust the thrust

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.680
to perfectly balance air resistance,
and maintain exactly this acceleration.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.900
Oh, my goodness-

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.740
how do you feel?

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.180
This is incredible.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.820
So, it's like throwing this bottle
into the air

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.080
the pen inside experiences weightlessness

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.340
from the time it leaves my hand,
until it comes into contact again.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.180
After 22 seconds of weightlessness,
the pilots pull out of the dive

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.080
again, subjecting us to hyper-g...

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.900
as the plane accelerate upwards.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.840
In total, we have performed thirteen
of these zero-g parabolas-

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.160
plus, one martian gravity and
two moon gravity parabolas.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.180
Okay, we are now in Mars gravity.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.300
In Mars gravity i can do

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.600
one arm pull ups..

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.160
maybe.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.200
I am the martian.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.100
We brought along some experiments
to do in zero-g.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.360
So, this is in about 1g, 
of gravity

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.580
this are what the flame looks like
on this barbecue lighter

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.720
now we are gonna try it
in hyper-g?

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.800
And then we'll try it in zero-g

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.240
and it should be...

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.600
We will see...  (2x).

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.840
We take it for granted that flames
had this distinctive shape.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.920
But that only because of gravity.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.360
The products of combustion have more energy

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.760
and so, move around faster and take up more space
than the cooler air around them.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.660
Therefore, there is a buoyant force on them,
which is greater than their weight-

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.580
and so, hot air rises.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.300
This helps pulling the oxygen from 
around the flame to continue the reaction.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.540
We are going through hyper-g.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.220
i keep blowing out the candle, because...

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.220
The, uhhh... stress of hyper-g is
significant.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.880
In hyper-g, this effect is magnified.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.700
Since the effect of gravity is
almost twice as much.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.720
This amplifies the difference between
the weight of the hot air,

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.980
and the weight of the cooler air around it-

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.400
and so, the hot air rises faster...

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.960
making, a longer flame.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.980
Oh my goodness.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.860
Look at that flame just...

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.060
in zero-g 'cause there is...

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.700
much less buoyant force,

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.240
to carry away...

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.740
And so, the combustion is not as good
you can see a lot of smoke.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.920
coming off, of that candle.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.920
And it's incredible.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.100
So, we still have a gas flow

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.580
so this is why the flame
is not circular.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.400
It is not a sphere, but it looks very strange.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.520
In zero-g, the hot air is still 
less dense than the cooler air...

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.380
but, now there is no weight,

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.980
and no buoyant force.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.520
So, the flame doesn't rise as high.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.080
This flame still maintain some if it shape,
because of the flow of fuel from the lighter

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.920
otherwise, the flame would form a sphere.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.320
Like on the space station.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.220
Where, it's very difficult to maintain the
combustion reaction.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.100
because it's hard for oxygen to access the fuel

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.420
with all of the combustion 
products getting in the way.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.160
So, if you're ever unsure about what
the gravitational acceleration is where you are.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.580
Well, looking at a flame is a pretty
good way of finding out.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.740
I also brought along a slinky, to 
try the slow motion slinky drop

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.900
but, in zero-g.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.760
Of course, here i couldn't dangle
the slinky under it's own weight

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.240
so, i swung it around my head instead.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.100
The effect, should be similar with each
coils stretch to provide the tension that keeps...

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.940
the length of slinky beyond that...

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.240
accelerating in uniform circular motion.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.020
I wanted to see what happens to the 
end of the slinky, when i let go.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.680
Here we go, 3, 2, 1.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.140
Did you catch that?

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.460
The slinky remain fairly stretch out,

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.840
and kept rotating at about the
same frequency as before.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.600
Initially, i thought this was a boring result.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.880
But then i realized...

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.960
the reason the slinky doesn't contract,

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.780
is because weight, was never part
of this equation.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.480
The slinky stretched out in the first place,
because it was rotating.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.100
And, since it's rotating after i let go...

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.060
roughly, the same amount of tension
is required to maintain that circular motion.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.740
And so, it doesn't contract.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.760
In zero-g, it's possible to have a stretched
slinky rotating in place,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.000
without contracting

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.300
as long as the tension in the slinky provides 
the centripetal force, it will keep spinning.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.720
This just goes against my intuition.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.120
Which is, made of course...

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.120
only had of experiences with gravity.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.300
Being weightless, was an unforgettable
experience.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.040
But, maybe my favorite part,

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.640
was how it challenged my intuition.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.380
And that's the reason, we need to do research,
in zero-g.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.680
I want to say a huge thanks, to the team at NovaSpace
who made this an unforgettable experience.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.540
And of course, Bruce who runs a french youtube channel, e-penser for inviting me.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:41.620
You should really go check out his video from the zero-g experience, and of course Diana, the Physics Girl.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.640
Go check out her video on zero-g here.
