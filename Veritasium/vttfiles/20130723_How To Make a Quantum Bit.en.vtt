00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.700
To find the prime factors of a 2048 number
it would take a classical computer millions

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.179
of years, a quantum computer could do it in
just minutes.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.090
And that is because a quantum computer is
built on qubits, these devices which take

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.810
advantage of quantum super position to reduce
the number of steps required to complete the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.220
computation.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.929
But how do you actually make a qubit in practice
and how do you read and write information

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:27.929
on it?

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.710
I met up with researchers who are using the
outer most electron in a phosphorous atom

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.870
as a qubit.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.900
This single phosphorous atom is embedded in
a silicon crystal right next to a tiny transistor.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.310
Now the electron has a magnetic dipole called
its spin.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:48.210
And it has two orientations, up or down, which
are like the classical one and zero.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.990
Now to differentiate the energy state of the
electron when it is in spin up and spin down,

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.630
you need to apply a strong magnetic field.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.270
&gt;&gt; And to do that we use a super conducting
magnet.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.040
So super conducting magnet is a large solenoid.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.170
It is a coil of super conducting wire that
sits inside of that vessel that is full of

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.170
liquid helium.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.340
&gt;&gt; So now the electron will line up with its
spin pointing down.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.979
That is its lowest energy state.

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.049
And it would take some energy to put it into
the spin up state.

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.130
But actually not that much energy and if it
were at room temperature the electron would

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.990
have so much thermal energy that it would
be bouncing around from spin up to spin down

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.990
and back.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.159
And so you need to cool down the whole apparatus
to only a few hundredths of a degree above

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.799
absolute zero.

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.539
That way you know that the electron will definitely
be spin down.

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.380
&gt;&gt; There is not enough thermal energy in the
surroundings to flip it the other way.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.159
&gt;&gt; Now if you want to write information onto
the qubit, you can put the electron into the

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.570
spin up state by hitting it with a pulse of
microwaves.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.149
But that pulse needs to be a very specific
frequency and that frequency depends on the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.659
magnetic field that the electron is sitting
in.

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.100
&gt;&gt; So what you see here is the frequency that
is being produced by this microwave source

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:09.500
and it is 45.021 gigahertz, which in the magnetic
field that we are applying now is the resonance

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.240
frequency of the electron.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.940
&gt;&gt; So the electron is a little bit like a
radio that can only tune in to one station.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.550
And when that station is broadcasting, the
electron gets all excited and turns to the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.599
spin up state.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.420
&gt;&gt; But you can stop at any point.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.599
So if you just make a new tape and stop your
pulse and some specific point, what you have

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:33.420
created is a special quantum super position
of the spin up and spin down states with a

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.450
specific phase between the two super positions.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.880
&gt;&gt; And how do you read out the information?

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.420
Well, you use the transistor that this phosphorous
atom is embedded next to.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.720
&gt;&gt; The spin down has the lower energy.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.240
And the spin up has the higher energy.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.570
Now in this transistor there is, in fact,
a little bundle of electrons.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.110
This bundle of electrons is filled up up to
a certain axis.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.910
This vertical axis here is energy.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.280
And here we have got all these electrons that
line up in energy just like the electrons

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.980
on the shells of an atom.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.121
So now if the electron is pointing up, it
can jump into the transistor, right, because

00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:15.030
it has more energy than all the others.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.870
It leaves behind the bare nuclear charge of
the phosphorous, right?

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.160
The phosphorous one more positive charge in
the nucleus as compared to silicon, but normally

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.730
it is neutralized by the extra electron so
the two things cancel out.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.920
But if you take the electron away, then the
phosphorous has a positive charge.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.580
So it is as if you have a positive voltage,
a more positive voltage applied to this gate.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.600
It doesn’t come from the gate.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.100
It comes from the atom, but is the same.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.580
It is just a positive voltage.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.010
&gt;&gt; It is like the transistor has been switched
more on.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.110
And so you see a pulse of current and that
indicates that the electron was in the spin

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.110
up state.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.061
&gt;&gt; In this measurement phase, if you find
one of these spikes of current, it is because

00:03:56.061 --> 00:03:57.430
you had an electron spin up.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.330
So it can play catching a spin up or a spin
down event.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.780
You use, there was no current here.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.050
That was a spin down event.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.840
And try again.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.120
Again a spin down electron.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.210
Spin up electron.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.320
&gt;&gt; Now these researchers have actually gone
further using the nucleus of the phosphorous

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.820
atom as a qubit.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.979
Like an electron, the nucleus has a spin,
although it is 2000 times weaker than the

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.270
spin of the electron.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.000
But you can still write to it the same way
using electromagnetic radiation, only it needs

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.539
to be a longer wavelength and a longer pulse
in order to get the spin to flip.

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:39.180
&gt;&gt; Because it is so small, so weakly magnetic
and so perfectly isolated from the rest of

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.289
the world, it is a qubit that lives for a
very long time.

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.229
&gt;&gt; But how do you read out the spin of the
nucleus?

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.800
Well, you use the electron.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.409
Remember that the electron’s frequency that
it will respond to depends on the magnetic

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:54.409
field that it is sitting in.

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:59.159
&gt;&gt; So that magnetic field is the external
magnetic field that is produced by the super

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:04.139
computing magnet, but there is also an internal
magnetic field coming from the nucleus.

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.930
But that internal magnetic field can have
two directions.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:07.930
Right?

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.580
The nucleus can be pointing up or down itself.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:17.360
So what it means is that there are two frequencies
at which the electron can respond, depending

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.669
on the direction of the nucleus.

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.050
&gt;&gt; So the nucleus actually acts as a little
selector.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.740
It tells the electron, basically, which radio
station it can listen to.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:34.830
&gt;&gt; So what you are looking at now is an experiment
where we actually flip the nucleus every five

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.020
seconds.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.689
So for five seconds you will see that the
electron always responds, because the nucleus

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:46.249
is always in the right direction to make the
electron respond to the frequency we are applying

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:47.449
to the electron.

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:51.229
And then for the other five seconds, the electron
will not respond, because we have flipped

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:52.789
the nucleus the other way.

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:53.789
So now watch.

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:54.789
You see?

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.079
&gt;&gt; So in this period of time the nucleus has
been flipped down.

00:05:58.079 --> 00:05:59.079
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:01.219
&gt;&gt; And now after five seconds it will flip
up and then...

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:02.219
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you see?

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:03.479
&gt;&gt; And then the electron starts responding.

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:04.479
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:10.139
So you are watching on the oscilloscope screen
in real time the measurement of the direction

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:14.889
of a single nucleus and our ability to flip
it at will every five seconds.

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:16.479
&gt;&gt; The spin of the single nucleus.

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:17.479
&gt;&gt; Nucleus.

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:21.449
&gt;&gt; Now because all of this depends so sensitively
on magnetic fields, you need to make sure

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:24.629
to eliminate all spin from the silicon crystal.

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:30.939
But, unfortunately, natural silicon contains
about five percent the isotope silicon 29

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:32.150
and that does have a spin.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:37.919
&gt;&gt; But, in fact, the beauty of silicon is
that it has this isotope called silicon 28

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.460
that has no nuclear spin.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.220
The nuclear spin is zero.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.639
So it is a completely non magnetic atom.

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:47.360
&gt;&gt; But where are you going to find a pure
crystal of silicon 28?

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.449
Oh, wait.

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:54.819
&gt;&gt; These isotopically purified silicon 28
crystals are being produced anyway for a purpose

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:56.599
completely different from particle computing.

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:00.719
They are being produced to redefine the kilogram
through the Avogadro project.

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:06.490
&gt;&gt; So the off cuts from that silicon sphere
are actually being used as the home for qubits.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.319
That, I think, is incredible.

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:12.210
There is no waste in this science.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.629
