00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:01.650
Standing on the scale.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.880
The wheel is spinning and it still weighs
92 kilograms.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.880
You made the prediction.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.639
Let’s see what happens when I throw it up
over my head in three, two, one.

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:19.970
What do you think?I don’t know about you,
but to me it looked like a shaky mess.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:32.590
Let’s watch that again in slow-mo and I
will graph the scale readings.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.540
As you can see, during the lift the scale
oscillates around 91 kilograms, the same as

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.510
it read when I was stationary.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.489
So it seems the apparatus doesn’t get heavier
or lighter when it is lifted while spinning.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.399
The only large deviation from the average
comes at the end of the lift when I let the

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.140
wheel fall so the scale reading drops.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.540
And then I slow its descent and so the scale
reading rises.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.489
So the question remains: If the wheel doesn’t
get lighter, why does it feel lighter?

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.960
This demonstration was first performed by
Professor Eric Laithwaite.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.360
Listen to how he describes it.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.290
&gt;&gt; So here goes 40 pounds of wheel as light
as a feather.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.670
This is not a conjuring trick.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.869
This is a fact of science.

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.259
&gt;&gt; He sure makes it look easy, doesn’t he?

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.320
&gt;&gt; Watch it again carefully.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:26.450
A fact about a spinning wheel so far everyone
has missed.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.330
&gt;&gt; Professor Laithwaite claims the gyroscope’s
properties couldn’t be fully explained by

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.119
Newton’s laws of motion.

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.230
I disagree.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.820
But in order to understand why the wheel feels
so light, we first have to consider why it

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.390
feels heavy when it is not spinning.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.410
So two handed that is as far down the shaft
as you can hold it.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.360
&gt;&gt; Holding the shaft horizontally you clearly
need to provide an upward force equal to the

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.060
downward weight of the wheel.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.790
But this is not enough, because with only
these two forces there would be a neck torque

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.360
causing the apparatus to rotate.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.920
So you need to create a counter torque in
addition to supporting the weight of the wheel.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.580
This requires pushing down with one hand and
pulling up with the other.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.270
And the upward force must be greater than
the downward force by an amount equal to the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.270
weight of the wheel.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.890
So the force on each of your hands is significantly
greater than the weight of the wheel.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.819
Now once the wheel is spinning the torque
due to its weight now causes it to process

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.460
rather than fall to the ground.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.920
Therefore, no counter torque is necessary.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.450
You only need to supply an upward force equal
to the wheel’s weight.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.790
So it feels lighter.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.540
Now the trick to lifting a wheel over your
head is to push it forwards as you release

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.540
it.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.540
Laithwaite knew this.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.260
If you force a gyroscope to process faster,
it lifts up.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.959
&gt;&gt; Higher the procession and it rises.

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.660
&gt;&gt; But the weight doesn’t change.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.349
Similarly, if you slow the procession of a
gyroscope, it goes down.

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.560
&gt;&gt; Slow the procession and it falls dramatically.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.750
&gt;&gt; I showed you right?&gt;&gt;

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.060
Now show it to me.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.110
&gt;&gt; Hard to go back the way that it doesn’t
want to process.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.110
&gt;&gt; [unintelligible]

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.569
Now you can’t say it becomes as light as
a feather when it is rising.

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.319
&gt;&gt; It certainly doesn’t become as light
as a feather.

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.390
I can say that, too, from having felt it.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.660
But it does feel lighter.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.950
And I think, maybe, part of that has to do
with the fact that I am not having to counter

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.450
the torque with my hand, you know?

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.379
All I have to do is support the weight of
the disc, but I don’t need to provide any

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.720
torque with my hand to counter that gravitational
part, which is what makes it feel so awkward

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.840
when you are trying to hold it when it is
static.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.380
&gt;&gt; When you apply a torque, as you were, then
the force up on one side of the hand and down

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.290
on the other side.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:41.939
And if you decrease the force on both sides,
then it will actually feel lighter.

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:43.879
&gt;&gt; It feels lighter without actually getting
lighter.

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:44.879
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:51.799
What it does is to take first the apparent
weight that you were feeling.
