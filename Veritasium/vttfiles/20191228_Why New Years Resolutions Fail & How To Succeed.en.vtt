00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
Most New Year's resolutions fail.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.600
So in this video I want to talk about the science of why they fail

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.640
and how to avoid that so your New Year's resolutions actually succeed

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.760
and I want to tell you about three of my New Year's resolutions for 2020.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.040
The first one is to stop going to news websites

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.680
I find I kill a ton of time by doing that

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.680
Now don't get me wrong, I do think it's important to know what's going on in the world,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.600
but I just don't think following the day-to-day developments of the news cycle is the way to do that

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.360
so instead I am going to get one newspaper delivered to my house every week

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.920
and that is how I am gonna stay informed

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.680
Research has shown it is more effective to make resolutions at new years than at any other time of the year.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.400
In fact, one study found that people who made resolutions on January 1st

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:59.120
were 10 times as likely to stick with them 6 months later than people who made their resolutions at other times of the year

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.840
And January 1st 2020 is the first day of a new decade

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.880
so it may be even better.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.640
Side note: those of you who want to argue that the first day of the decade is actually January 1st 2021,

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.480
while you may technically be correct because there was no year 0,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.240
we went straight from 1 BC to 1 AD

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.280
for all intents and purposes psychologically this January 1st is the first day of the 2020s

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.240
and that is what matters.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.840
So the technicalities I think, are unimportant. Abd this argument should be put to bed

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.140
The 2020s start on Jan 1

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.920
But now the bad news: even a resolution made at New Year's will most likely fail

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.560
which is why gyms are packed in January, but they start to clear out by March

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.920
what research has found that only around 8% of people can stick with their resolutions through the end of the year

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.720
So why is this? And, how do we avoid that trap?

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.560
I think it all starts with a misconception

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.440
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oooooh no.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.160
Foooget. *sigh*

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.160
Well this was going part of the video where I ran on the treadmill but the treadmill's just broken

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.040
so I think the misconception is, that people think that in order to make big changes in their lives

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.640
that they have to make some sort of really big effort

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.360
I mean let's say your goal was to run a marathon

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.440
you might plan on running ten kilometers three times a week

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.360
that seems kind of proportionate to the end goal

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.920
and you might be excited and really motivated to do it for the first few weeks

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.280
but at some point that motivation is gonna lag

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.560
and running 10k is gonna seem too hard

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.440
and so you're gonna sort of fall back into old habits

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.040
the misconception is thinking you need to go big,

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.880
and so being over ambitious with your goals and then not being able to commit and stick to them

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.680
I'm gonna fix this.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.520
The truth is you're much better off if you pick small targets that you can hit consistently

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.120
that's the idea behind James Clear's book "Atomic Habits"

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:14.680
which is this idea that if you can get just 1% better every day at something, it will take a minimum amount of effort

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.360
but over time the effects will compound just like compound interest

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.080
and James Clear proposes the two-minute rule:

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.760
'pick something that you can do in just two minutes'

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.760
So if you want to run a marathon, start by say running two minutes a day

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.680
that is something that you can't say you don't have time for

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.280
and once that habit sticks, well then you can try to extend it into something more ambitious

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.120
the next problem with resolutions is they are too often vague

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.040
the most common resolutions that people make are to

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.320
lose weight, exercise more, and to eat better.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.520
the problem is those things are so nondescript that it's hard to know if you're making progress

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.080
and it's really easy to regress into your old habits

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.560
so the science around this says you need to be specific

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.600
AND, write down your goals

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.840
people who write down their goals are 40% more likely to achieve them

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.160
that is pretty significant just by taking that step of putting pen to paper

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.320
and I'm thinking here in this video you should put your New Year's resolutions in the comments

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.640
because at least that is taking a step towards committing yourself to a goal for the year

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:34.160
My second new year's resolution for 2020 is to write in a daily planner every day of this year

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.920
In fact I can be more specific than that.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.640
Um, I will write one word in this book each day

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:49.320
now I know one word might seem unhelpfully ridiculously little to write in this book

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.360
but I want to commit to this idea of starting small

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.720
with the idea that if I get in the habit of making the time to at least write down one word on each one of these pages,

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.400
well then maybe some days I will write more than one word

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.800
and that will be helpful in terms of planning my day a little bit

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.160
and so hopefully I will be more productive than I would have been otherwise

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.760
and then it's really important to track your progress in an obvious and visual way

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.120
and I'm going to use the everyday calendar by Simone Giertz

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.160
Oddly satisfying.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.560
Where there's a button for every day of the year

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.280
and you can push it and the light turns on

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.680
and that is really satisfying

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:46.800
so I think this will encourage me to write down a word early in the day so that I can go and turn on the light for that day

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.200
what's great about this is it's a very visual way to track my progress

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.800
and to have it in an obvious place where I can look at it all the time

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.080
and I'll put it in the back of shot for some of my videos in 2020

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.960
so you guys can see how I'm progressing towards this goal

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.440
so the third major problem with New Year's resolutions is that people seem to think

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:12.320
it's about having more willpower or motivation, being able to resist temptation better

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.200
but willpower is a finite resource

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:20.600
and it can be depleted that there are gonna be some bad days and that is when you're gonna relapse

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.960
so relying on willpower is not an effective strategy

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.640
and research has shown that people who have better self-control

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.000
actually just have to exercise it less

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.680
the way they're able to do that is by structuring their environments so they don't have to exercise their willpower

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:44.400
I find in my kitchen it's always like the treats and snacks which are left out on the counter

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.560
but the veggies which are like tucked away in the vegetable crisper drawer

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.160
and I get it because you know that's where the veggies are meant to go to keep them crisp,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.240
but the problem is if I don't see them, if they're not in my line of sight, I will just end up eating what's on the counter

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.240
and not going digging for veggies

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:09.200
so we need a way of changing our environments so that we make better choices

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.160
which brings me to my third and final new year's resolution for 2020:

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.280
I am deleting social media apps off of my phone

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.480
I'm getting rid of Instagram and Twitter. You are watching the exact moment that I do that

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.800
the reason for this is I find I just kill way too much time going into these apps

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.560
and research shows that any tiny distraction that you have during your day

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.280
takes you you know something like 20,25 minutes to get back into your work

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.160
and so I'm losing a lot of time to just procrastinating with these apps

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.560
so I'm getting rid of them off my phone

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.600
so I don't have to use my willpower to not click them mindlessly as I normally would

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:55.880
and I've actually downloaded an app that will block news sites and block my social media while I'm working

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.760
because that way I don't have to restrain myself

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.080
the systems that I put in place will restrain me for me

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.840
I know a lot of this sounds a little bit CGP Grey

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.560
but I think he's on to something

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:13.360
you don't need to follow the day-to-day movements of the news cycle and you do not need to be scrolling social media all the time

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.760
particularly when you're trying to get useful work done

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.920
so that's how I feel

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:24.760
I want to optimize my 2020 by locking down all my potential distractions not needing any willpower,

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:29.760
and I've got some small, specific, and written down,

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.160
targeted with tracking plans for 2020

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:38.080
so I'd love to know what you're planning for 2020 for your New Year's resolutions

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.360
What are your plans for the next decade?

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.880

and Deep Work by Cal Newport

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:16.120
and I was re-listening to these books recently when I was taking my kids out for nap drives

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:21.240
and in fact it was on one of these drives that I came up with my new year's resolutions for 2020

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.040
