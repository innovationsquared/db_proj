00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.060
Happy 500,000!

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.650
Thank you guys so much for subscribing to
my channel and for joining me on this scientific

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.650
adventure.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.049
You know, if you got 500,000 people together
and we all held hands in a line, it would

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.810
stretch from Sydney to Melbourne or from San
Francisco to San Diego or from London to Inverness.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.810
&gt;&gt; Oy.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.449
What are you forming a line here for?

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.669
You are going to scare off Nessy.

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:30.669
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.470
So I suppose I should get down to answering
your question.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.470
Go ahead.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.470
Hit me with your best shot.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.060
&gt;&gt; I understand that the sky is blue do to
Rayleigh scattering.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.780
Short wave lengths get scattered way more
and blue light dominates because it is so

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.780
short.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.020
If that is the case, why isn’t the sky violet?

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.820
&gt;&gt; Ok, here is the thing.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.440
The sky isn't really blue.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.440
It is bluish white.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.920
So the sky is illuminated by the sun and the
sun in its all colors, but not equally.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.850
The sun doesn’t emit that much red, nor
does it emit that much violet.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.860
Most of the light it emits is kind of in the
greeny part of the spectrum.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.080
Now as you point out, due to Rayleigh scattering
more of the shorter wavelengths arte scattered

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.610
and that is why the sky looks blue, because
it is basically the sun’s white spectrum

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.040
shifted a little bit towards the blue.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.670
This is the spectrum of the blue sky.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.210
And, as you can see, it is quite broad.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.500
And, in fact, there is a fair amount of violet
light in there.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.570
But there is not as much violet light as there
is blue light, because the sunlight that we

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.780
started with had much more blue than it has
violet.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.990
&gt;&gt; If I have a lap top on the international
space station with a hard disk drive in it,

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.510
will the torque from its spinning cause the
lap top to spin as well?&gt;&gt;

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.979
Well, by the law of conservation of angular
momentum, yes, the lap top should spin.

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.640
I did a quick back of the envelope calculation
and I found that if you spun up your hard

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.470
disk from rest up to 5400 rpm, then it would
cause the laptop to spin in the opposite direction

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.869
at a rate hat would cause it to do about one
revolution every 17 seconds.

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.930
&gt;&gt; What would happen if you poured liquid
oxygen on a fire?

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.720
&gt;&gt; Kaboom?

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.749
&gt;&gt; Say you were able to pass the event horizon
a black hole and come back, what would coming

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:16.769
back look like of the person and for an observer?

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.500
&gt;&gt; Well, to an outside observer it would look
as though you never came back at all.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.950
And to the person it would look as though
you didn’t come back either, because once

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.279
you are passed the event horizon, that is
it.

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:31.779
Your entire future lies within the black hole.

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:36.030
And it will only be a matter of seconds before
you are in the singularity, the very core

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.419
of this black hole and you are no longer.

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:44.909
Now if you could bring a rocket back with
you and try to fight it, if you tried to accelerate

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:51.010
away from the black hole, you would find that
you actually live for less time.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.269
You might see more space, but your time would
pass more slowly and so you would end up in

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.750
the singularity sooner.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.970
So I guess the lesson is don’t fight it.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.379
If you want to live longer, just relax and
go with it.

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.749
&gt;&gt; You have met a lot of interesting people
on your adventures.

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:13.800
But is there someone specific that you would
love to meet?

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.739
&gt;&gt; I would love to meet Bill Nye, Neil DeGrasse
Tyson, Richard Dawkins and President Obama

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.540
as a non scientist inclusion.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.739
I really like his book.

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.469
So if you haven’t read The Audacity of Hope
that is a good recommendation.

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:30.969
&gt;&gt; If all the galaxies are constantly accelerating
away from each other, will they ever reach

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:33.869
the speed of light or stop accelerating all
together?

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:38.379
&gt;&gt; So, yeah, all the galaxies do seem to be
accelerating away from each other, faster

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.999
and faster, which makes this kind of a unique
time in the history of the earth, because

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:47.799
right now we can still see that there are
hundreds of billions of galaxies.

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.709
But sometime in the future due to the expansion
of the universe, those galaxies will be so

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.870
far away and, yes, they will be receding at
faster than light speed and then you might

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.059
say: Well, nothing can go faster than light.

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:05.510
And it is kind of true in that these galaxies
won’t be moving through space at a speed

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.120
faster than light, but the space in between
us and them will be expanding at a rate which

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.729
means they will be moving relative to us faster
than light, if that makes any sense.

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.810
So their light that they are emitting will
never be able to reach us, because it will

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.780
never be able to make progress through this
expanding space.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.530
It is kind of interesting to think about what
will happen as that time approaches.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.449
Well, the light that is coming from those
distant galaxies travels across this expanding

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:34.449
space.

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.009
And so it becomes red shifted, cosmologically.

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.479
And eventually the wave length of this light
will be so big that its wavelength is the

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.220
size of the whole universe and that is impossible
to detect.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.770
So at some point, probably about two trillion
years in the future we will only see our local

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.590
cluster of galaxies.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.789
Now the reason they haven’t gone out to
infinity, or very, very far away is because

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.090
they are gravitationally bounded to us.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.300
So even though space is expanding on a large
scale, the gravitational force is enough to

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.110
hold all of us together so we will be in it
for the long haul.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.009
But this still means that there is going to
be strange cosmology.

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.919
If we are still around trillions of years
from now, if we tried to look out, we would

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.639
see a very different universe, a universe
which is much emptier than the one we see

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:18.639
today.

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:21.479
So we live at a unique point in space time.

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:22.509
We should appreciate that.

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:25.550
&gt;&gt; Is there such a thing as randomness in
the universe?

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.260
And if so, isn’t that contradictory to science?

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.169
&gt;&gt; Yes, I think there is randomness in the
universe and, no, I do not think this contradicts

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:34.169
science.

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.460
Though, perhaps you are thinking along the
lines of Albert Einstein when he said: God

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.599
does not play dice.

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:43.760
He wasn’t happen when in quantum mechanics
it seemed as though some events have probabilistic

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.760
outcomes.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.951
I mean, he thought that there were some hidden
variables there and we just didn’t know

00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:49.560
what was determining the outcome.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.479
So we thought it was probabilistic.

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.580
But all experiments seem to show, up to this
point, anyway, that there are some things

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.930
which are randomly determined.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.160
They are probabilistic in their nature.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.060
For example, you can get quantum, random number
generators and even the FBI and CIA can’t

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.909
seem to find any pattern in those numbers.

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.919
So they really, truly do seem to be random.

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:15.789
So, yes, it seems from all the experimental
evidence that randomness is a fundamental

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:19.659
part of our universe, albeit mostly on the
quantum scale.

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:25.699
&gt;&gt; What shape is the universe and could light
from our sun go around the universe and come

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:28.030
back and hit the other side of earth?

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:33.860
&gt;&gt; The shape of the universe seems to be flat,
which means there is no large scale curvature

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.000
of space time.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.229
And the supposed reason for this is inflation,
this idea that very, very shortly after the

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:46.100
big bang the whole universe just started accelerating
at an incredibly fast rate.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.810
So even if it was kind of wiggly or warped
or curved around on itself before inflation,

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:56.129
after inflation it basically would have been
flattened out, just like blowing up a balloon,

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:59.480
that side is going to become, you know, more
or less flat.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.639
So within the limits of our observational
capabilities to these days, we think that

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:05.120
that the universe is flat.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.599
So if you go out in one direction you probably
shouldn’t return the way you came.

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:13.410
So, no, the universe does not appear to be
closed and you would probably never see the

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.280
light coming up behind you.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:21.190
&gt;&gt; Hey, man, I have one fantastic topic for
you to make a video about, but I need your

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.449
response.

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:24.169
You want to do it?

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:27.039
Otherwise I contact Vsauce.

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:32.860
&gt;&gt; Hey, Michael, you want this one or shall
I take it?

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:33.860
&gt;&gt; No, no, no.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.069
Go ahead, Derek, take it.

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:44.460
&gt;&gt; So we are really reaching the atomic size,
but not in some exotic laboratory device.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.900
In every device you have in your computer.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.250
&gt;&gt; How many transistors are on a chip now?

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.510
&gt;&gt; About a billion.
