00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.120
I'm gonna give you guys three numbers. A
three number sequence and I have a rule

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.500
in mind that these three numbers obey
and I want you to try to figure out what that rule is.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.660
But the way you can get information is by proposing your own set of three numbers, to which I will say yes

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.600
that follows my rule or no it doesn't follow my rule. And then you can propose what you think the rule is.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.859
Is that fair?

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.340
Okay, so here are the three
numbers: 2, 4, 8.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.640
2, 4, 8.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.099
You don't need to continue the sequence,
you can propose a totally different

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.979
sequence, whatever you want to propose
and I will simply say yes or no

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.460
2, 4, 8?

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.980
16, 32

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.200
16

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.160
32

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.640
and

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.080
64?

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.380
Those also follow my rule.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.880
ok

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.720
What's the rule you think?

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.700
Multiply by 2?

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.020
That is...

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.920
not my rule.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.420
What?

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.100
That's not my rule.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.600
But you're allowed, if you want, propose 3 other numbers.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.580
3, 6, 12.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.560
3, 6, 12? Follows my rule.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.100
10, 20, 40.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.220
That follows the rule.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.680
I'm still multiplying by two

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.180
I know

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.240
[Laughter]

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.280
I know what you're doing.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.320
and yes it follows my rule but no it's not
my rule.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.820
5, 10 and 20?

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.880
Follows my rule

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.970
100, 200, 400?

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.320
Follows my rule

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.540
500, 1000, 2000

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.440
Follows my rule.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.940
You want me to keep going?

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.940
But do I just keep going? You going to tell me or what?

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.580
[Laughter]

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.190
Am I doing it the wrong way? Am I approaching this the wrong way?

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.710
You're totally fine, but you're approaching the way most
people approach it.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.440
Like think strategically about this.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.869
You want information. I have
information. The point of the three

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.500
numbers, right, is to allow you to figure
out what the rule is.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.250
Okay, I'm going to give you the
numbers that I don't think fits the

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.730
sequence and see what you'll say.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.240
So I'll say 2, 4, 7.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:52.820
Fits my rule

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.710
So, whatever I propose is right? So, is
your rule like

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.600
you can propose any number?

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.320
So, the rule is anything we say is yes?

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.000
No

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.680
Damn it

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.900
[Laughter]

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.880
But you were on the right track now.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.180
Hit me with three numbers.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.360
3, 6, 9.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.900
Follows my rule.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.540
Hmm...

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.620
Oh, that didn't follow my rule.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.360
This is good, right?

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.540
5, 10, 15.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.020
That follows my rule.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.240
What? Oh... Really?

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.060
Yeah

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.960
I don't believe this.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.720
1, 2, 3?

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.520
Follows the rule

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.000
What about 7, 8, 9?

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.100
[Laughter] Yes, that follows the rule.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.080
8

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.400
16

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.480
39

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.940
Fits the rule.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:37.720
Excellent.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.540
But we're no closer to the rule. I want you
get to the rule.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.020
How about 1, 7, 13 ?

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.180
Follows the rule.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.240
11, 12, 13?

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.540
How does this make sense? Follows the rule.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.260
10, 9, 8? I don't know how to do this.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.360
Does not follow the rule.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.460
10, 9, 8 does not.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.820
Oh, so, is it all in ascending order?

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.280
Boo yeah! Up top!

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.460
Yes. First ones to get it. You guys nailed it

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.480
That's the rule

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.169
That's the rule. Numbers in increasing order.

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:06.009
Awww

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.840
Numbers in ascending order

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.700
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, doesn't matter.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.100
Any numbers in ascending order.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.560
I was inspired to make this video by the
book the black swan by Nassim Taleb.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.500
Now, the black swan is a metaphor for the
unknown and the unexpected.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.620
I mean in the old world the theory was
that all swans were white.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.760
So, each instance of a white swan would
make you think,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.900
"Yeah, that theory is pretty good."

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.320
But the point is you can never
prove a theory true and in fact when

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.510
people found Australia they realized
that there were black swans.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.720
What was interesting for me was that
everyone I spoke to came up with a rule

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.880
very early on and then only proposed
numbers that fit with that rule they were thinking.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.620
I was looking for you guys
to propose a set of numbers that didn't

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.370
follow your rule and didn't follow
my rule. I was looking for you guys not

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.910
to try to confirm what you believe. 
You're always asking something where you

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.440
expect the answer  to be yes, right?

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.540
Like, you're trying to get at it.
But, instead you want to get the no's.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.920
You want to get the no because that's much more
informational for you then yes,

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.720
Like everything is a yes..

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.560
That is true. That is really true and
once you say that.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.220
That is what's so important about the scientific method. We set out to disprove our theories

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.240
and it's when can't disprove them that we say this
must be getting at something really true

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.970
about our reality. So, I think we should
do that in all aspects of our lives

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.810
if you think that something is true you
should

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.140
try as hard as you can to disprove it.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.500
Only then can you really get at the
truth and not fool yourself.
