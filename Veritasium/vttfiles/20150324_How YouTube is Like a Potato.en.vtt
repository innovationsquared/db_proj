00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.920
Potatoes are native to the Americas.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.130
In fact, there are over 3000 varieties in
the South American Andes alone.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.589
Now in the 1600s and 1700s, European explorers
took potatoes back to Europe where they were

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:19.850
cultivated and they quickly became a dietary
staple, especially in Ireland.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.190
There the farmers found that on their small
plots of land, potatoes gave larger and more

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.570
reliable yields than grains.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.590
And pretty soon the average Irish peasant
was eating between eight and 14 pounds of

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.150
potatoes per day, from which they derived
about 80 percent of their daily caloric intake.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.199
These nutritious potatoes helped reduce infant
mortality and led to a population explosion

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:45.479
in Ireland.

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:50.320
The population actually doubled from four
million to eight million between 1780 and

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.880
1840.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.350
So potatoes supported a whole new group of
people in a way that was never before possible.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:04.320
But then in 1845 a fungus spread across Europe
destroying almost the entire Irish potato

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.320
crop.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.220
And the fungus was particularly devastating
because there was really only one variety

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.320
of potato in Ireland, the Irish lumper, and
it had limited genetic diversity.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.400
And so within five years one million Irish
people had died and a further one and a half

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.170
million had fled the country.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.680
Now YouTube is a little bit like a potato
in that in the 10 years since its inception

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.000
it has made possible a new way of life for
thousands of people including myself.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And for that I am incredibly grateful.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.980
YouTube and you who have watched my videos
have made it possible for me to pursue my

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.120
passion, making science films.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.530
But if there is a lesson we should learn from
the Irish potato famine it is that depending

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.420
on only one source for your livelihood puts
you in an incredibly precarious position.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.120
And starting today there is a new potato,
or new video sharing platform called Vessel

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.080
on which I will also be launching my videos
in addition to YouTube.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.490
Now Vessel will charge a three dollar monthly
subscription fee in order to get exclusive,

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.120
early access to videos before they are posted
on YouTube.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.060
But if you sign up in the next three days
you will get free membership for a year and

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.280
no credit card is required.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.600
So if you want to check it out, click the
link in the description.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.120
Now if you donâ€™t want to sign up to Vessel,
that is completely fine, too.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.610
I will continue posting my videos as usual
here on YouTube.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.220
The idea with Vessel is to generate more revenue
for creators by offering this exclusive early

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.220
access.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.550
It is a bit like how movies are launched first
in cinemas and then on DVD and finally on

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.610
TV.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.150
Now will this work?

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.290
I have no idea.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.910
But you know my feeling about risk.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.709
And, in this case, I think it is worth taking
a chance.

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.690
So if you want to take that chance with me,
then click the link in the description or

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.150
head over to Vessel.com/science.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.050
Now Minute Physics and Minute Earth will also
be launching first on Vessel and we all decided

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.959
to use a joint link, Vessel.com/science.

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.200
So when you sign up via that link, you will
be supporting all of us, Veritasium, Minute

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.130
Physics and Minute Earth.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.040
You know, I think that having more diversity
and competition in online video is a good

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.040
thing.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.650
It will lead to more stability for creators,
more resources that I am going to use to make

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:37.730
bigger and better videos and, ultimately,
more tubers for YouTubers.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.239
That was not washed.

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.569
Unwashed potato.

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.530
Nutritious.
