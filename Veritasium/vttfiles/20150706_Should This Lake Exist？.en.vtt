00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.630
This is the largest body of water in California.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.200
It is about 25 kilometers wide by 55 kilometers
long.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.230
You can't even see the other end of this lake.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:21.300
And it is home to the most diverse number
of birds anywhere in the continental US besides

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.200
Big Bend in Texas.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.920
And here is the thing.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.079
This body of water is here by accident.

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:30.119
Let me explain.

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.280
Back in about the 1900s there were engineers
working on irrigating the fields of the American

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.579
southwest.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.810
They were using the water from the Colorado
River, but they were also trying to prevent

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.769
it from flooding, from flooding all this farmland.

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:51.390
Now in 1905 they got it a little bit wrong
and also the Colorado River flooded its banks

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.379
and used the channels they were building,
basically, to flood this whole plain.

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.519
Now this plain is actually about 70 meters,
over 200 feet, below sea level.

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.040
We are at one of the lowest points in North
America.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.300
So the water flooded in here, the entire volume
of the Colorado River flooded into this plain

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.840
for about two years before they were able
to stop the flooding.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:29.370
And what you are left with is the lake that
you can see today.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.410
The low-lying area where the Salton Sea now
is was formed due to tectonic activity.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.190
We are very close to the San Andreas Fault.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.680
And that also means there is magma very close
to the surface here.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:02:21.860
Sometimes that heat boils up through mud volcanoes
like these.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.209
And we are actually taking advantage of this
heat using seven geothermal plants, which

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:35.069
together generate enough electricity for over
100,000 homes.

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.909
Now initially people thought that this lake
was just going to dry out.

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.620
This is one of the hottest, driest parts of
the country.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.709
But it didn't.

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.379
The water didn't go away.

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:53.769
And so then people got the idea that they
would take advantage of this little accident

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.220
and try to dress this whole place up like
a new Riviera.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:05.430
&gt;&gt; Here is truly a miracle in the desert,
a whole new outlet for the crowded millions

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.889
in big cities, a Palm Springs with water.

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.920
Here is where you can find the good life in
the sun.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.810
Today the Salton Riviera...

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.170
&gt;&gt; And for a time it worked.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.840
In the 50s and 60s they started building towns
here and resorts and celebrities came to this

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.060
place and people would enjoy the water.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.560
They actually added fish to this lake.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.040
And the fishing was so good you could throw
in a hook and pull out a fish without even

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.510
putting any bait on it.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.290
Of course, there was lots of bird life and
people really enjoyed themselves.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.640
It looked as though everything was going great.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.439
Until, well, the lake started to turn a little
bit.

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:48.659
You see, the only real inflows of water to
this lake are from agricultural runoff and

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:54.180
they bring salt into the lake and there is
no outflow for this lake, because it is so

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.180
low.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.870
It is already one of the lowest points in
North America.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.200
It is below sea level.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.040
So all that happens is the water then evaporates,
leaving the salt behind and the salinity of

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.040
this water increases.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.349
It is now about 50 grams per liter, which
is quite a bit more than seawater.

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.239
And that makes it hard for the fish to survive.

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.252
So there are massive fish die-offs, which
create quite a smell.

00:04:17.252 --> 00:04:19.470
It is a bit stinky over here.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.520
And algal blooms have also occurred making
the water this ugly brown color.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.889
I wouldn't really want to go swimming in there.

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.770
And the resorts have all closed up.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.990
There is only a few people left here.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.270
You know, when you drive around here you find
those old resort areas, places where people

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.840
thought, you know, it was going to be the
next Riviera.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.789
And now they are deserted, ghost towns.

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.190
And there is boats abandoned up on the shore.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:57.470
It is a kind of depressing place, which is
strange, given the kind of natural beauty.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.420
Some people might think that letting this
lake evaporate is the right thing to do, it

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.629
is the natural thing to do.

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:10.949
It returns it to its state from before we
accidentally flooded it back in 1905.

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:18.030
But if you look back a bit further you find
that there really did used to be a lake here,

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:24.560
a lake which came and went, but for the last
several thousand years the lake was here more

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.370
often than it was not.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.590
And it was filled up to a higher level.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.259
This whole story makes me thing two things.

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:41.380
First, as humans we have incredible power
to drastically shape the earth.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:47.699
We can cause entire seas to disappear and
we can create seas.

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:55.300
And the other thing is that in the absence
of effort, in the absence of our caring, things

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.130
tend towards disorder.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.259
Things naturally fall apart.

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:05.750
And I feel like if we don't do anything here,
the natural result is going to be messy and

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.750
ugly.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.520
I mean, if you just look around at what has
happened to the towns that have been abandoned

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.680
and the homes, which are crumbling, it looks
like a disaster area.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.710
It looks as bad as Chernobyl, but there was
no nuclear accident here.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:24.599
There is just a lack of caring.

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:27.330
And I think this applies to more than just
this sea.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.360
You know?

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:37.009
We have this kind of duty to recognize what
we do matters and if we don't care, if we

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:41.379
don't put in the effort, it is not going to
turn out very well.

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:45.370
I think that is the lesson of the Salton Sea.
