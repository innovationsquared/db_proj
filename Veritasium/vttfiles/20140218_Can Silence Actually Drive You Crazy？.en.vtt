00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.550
I am going to scream as loud as I can and
I am going to keep screaming as loud as I

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.110
can while I spin around. I will keep going
until my breath runs out.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.160
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.300
&gt;&gt; You ready? &gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.480
&gt;&gt; Ok [Screams]

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.580
&gt;&gt; That was outstanding. Thank you.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.440
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.890
&gt;&gt; The quietest place on earth is apparently
an anechoic chamber in Minneapolis. Now I

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.320
am here at BYU at their anechoic chamber.
Anechoic is Latin and basically means no echo.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.010
And the way they achieve no echo is through
all of these foam wedges which are put on the wall

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.050
and even the floor. You can see
that I am actually on a spring floor and down

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.780
below me there are all of these wedges.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.379
Now you may want to use headphones while you
are listening to this video, because that

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:48.999
is going to be quite important.

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:54.489
&gt;&gt; Low frequency sound will come in and, by
the shape of it, bounce and just keep bouncing

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.850
pretty much forever until it just gets lost
in the wall. And then high frequencies are

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.839
more so going to get absorbed into the foam
itself.

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.559
&gt;&gt; You can hear how the room deadens echoes
by clapping constantly while closing the doors.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:27.760
[Clapping]

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.840
It totally changes the quality of the sound.
&gt;&gt; Definitely.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.240
&gt;&gt; There are reports that it is impossible
to stay in one of these rooms and remain sane

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.810
for a significant period of time. The record
is apparently 45 minutes.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.650
&gt;&gt; I felt a little claustrophobic. And yet, it
felt like there is a lot of pressure on my

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.770
head.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.980
&gt;&gt; But why would that be? I mean, the air
is no different in here.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.340
&gt;&gt; What I figured is just because when you
listen in a normal room there is a lot of

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.800
reverb. To your ear that means there is a
lot of space, but there is none of that in

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.620
here, so it feels claustrophobic.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.830
&gt;&gt; It feels like you are in a tiny room, like
you could be in a coffin.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.290
&gt;&gt;Yeah, maybe, yeah.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.280
&gt;&gt; I think it is really an anxiety response.
So you are used to having these sounds around

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.230
you and then you don’t anymore and so you
start to panic, because you don’t have something

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.090
you are used to, and I think that anxiety can
increase, cause some stress, and maybe that's

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.350
why people go crazy or hallucinate with
sound. It is just because they are trying

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.350
to make up for what they are used to that
isn’t there.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.230
&gt;&gt; When I bring people in I warn them: Hey,
if you get a little dizzy, please let me know,

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.390
so I can get you out of the room before you
make a mess in our expensive facilities.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.560
&gt;&gt; First you will hear any rustle of your
clothing. So you move an inch and you will

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.920
hear it. Then you will hear any fluids that
are in your mouth or your throat. You'll

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.520
hear them all moving around every time you
move your mouth. And the longer you stay there

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.650
the more you will hear. So you will start
to hear the blood flow through your brain.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.630
&gt;&gt; Have you heard it?

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It sounds kind of like a ringing
or a pulsing.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.770
&gt;&gt; Can you kind of make the sound for us so
that we know what to listen in for?

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.400
&gt;&gt; Of the blood flow? &gt;&gt; Yeah, like...

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.160
&gt;&gt; It just sounds like a pulsing, like, shh,
shh, shh.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.120
Some people say they can hear their heart
beat coming from their chest as well.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:05.750
&gt;&gt; Have you heard that?

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.410
&gt;&gt; No.

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.699
&gt;&gt; A violinist placed in one of these rooms
was apparently banging on the door within a matter

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.000
of seconds trying to get out. Now
that people say it's impossible to stand up

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.900
because you become so disoriented, dizzy, nauseous. And some people even hear oral hallucinations.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.330
But to me it doesn’t sound right. You know,
I believe that I should be able to sit in

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.970
a room with no sound with the lights off for
as long as I like. And so I am going to put

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.090
myself to the test by staying in this room
for as long as I can.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.640
&gt;&gt; Have fun in silence.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.580
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.650
Now it is just me in the anechoic chamber.
And this is probably the quietest place I

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.770
have ever been. And in a second I will tell the
guys, shut the lights off.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.540
Ok, I think...

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.220
Oh. I am ready.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.140
And the lights are off. I'm going 
to turn off the camera so I don’t

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.530
have this light and then there is only the
audio recorder that I will keep with me.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.260
I'm not sure how long I have been in here,
but I still feel quite comfortable.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:44.120
It's nice and quiet. I mean, that is an understatement.
But it's relaxing.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.320
If I hear anything, I feel like I hear a low pitched hum.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.680
If I have to guess as to how long I have been
in here I would say about eight minutes.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:35.040
I feel like I am more aware of my heart. I
can feel each pulse, and I can almost feel

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.160
it radiating up my chest towards my head,

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.280
like a wave.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.340
And in my ears there's a hiss. 
I think that is just...

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.240
from hearing loss.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.600
This just reminds me of that Mission Impossible
movie where Tom Cruise sneaks into that building

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.800
and he has to keep his decibel level low.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.120
[Quiet burp]

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.160
That was a burp. I don’t know if you could
hear that.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:18.919
I can say the really small sounds seem amplified.
It is like your brain has recalibrated, so

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:21.019
the quiet things seem much louder.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.820
I feel like I can feel more things like...

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.160
with every beat of my heart it feels like...

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.220
my body shakes a little bit...

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.960
like a device that has
a little motor inside of it. How it gets shook around

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.550
like a thumb.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:54.259
Ok, Cameron, looks to me like we are good
for time. If it looks the same to you like

00:06:54.259 --> 00:07:02.720
we are around 46 minutes or over, I am happy
to hop out. So, yeah, when you are ready you

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.280
could flip the lights back on if you like.
Are you there?

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:12.600
Hello?

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.440
I think I have been in here for nearly
an hour according to my time checks. And I

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.350
didn’t fall asleep, I just, you know,
I have had a good time. It is a nice quiet

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.020
space. I kind of feel like this would be a
good material to pad your bedroom in. Not

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:34.610
a problem. Anechoic chamber, 45 minutes, an
hour. Easy. I could stay in here for five

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.490
hours. I think I could get a lot of work done
in here.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:48.470
So now I just have to get out. And I am going
to see if I can exit this room without them

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.620
turning the lights on.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:05.700
Even the doors are nice and quiet. There we are.
Back to the outside world.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.980
Hello, how are you doing?
&gt;&gt; You alive? &gt;&gt; I am.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:35.940
I don't really understand how anyone could go crazy in there. I mean, quiet is kind of nice. But then again

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.860
there are people who find all sorts of situations
really uncomfortable like just being in pitch

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:45.170
black room or being in a small confined space.
So maybe those types of people would find

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.920
this kind of unnerving.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.790
I definitely noticed that there were a lot
of noises. Like it wasn’t just pure silence.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:57.660
Like I actually have to work hard to make
things feel silent. Otherwise, you know, there

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:03.880
was the sound of like me just rubbing my beard
or just like the rustle of your clothes or

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:09.060
every time you swallow or you breathe. Perhaps
the weirdest thing I noticed was like my sense

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:16.260
of my heart. I just felt like it was pumping
really hard, and I could feel almost like the

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.440
blood pushing up through me. It wasn’t like
I was hearing it. It was just like I was feeling

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.540
it. And I was feeling it as though, in a way,
my heart

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.120
was shaking my body.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.440
That was something weird.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:35.160
But besides that, nothing crazy, no weird hallucinations
or anything like that.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:42.100
So I think the myth that you can’t stay
in here for longer than 45 minutes is busted,

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.420
even though this is not Myth Busters. I still
think it is not true.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:54.310
Now if you really hate silence, you should
always carry an audio book around with you.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:58.370
And I can recommend a good one: The Fault
in our Stars by my friend John Green. It is

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.040
an excellent book and it has been basically
the talk of the best sellers ever since it

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.660
was released. And soon there is a movie coming
out and so you probably want to get through

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.570
the book before you go and see the movie.
Now you can download this book for free by

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:14.220
going to Audible.com/Veritasium. Or you could
pick any other book of your choosing for a

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:20.010
one month free trial. Audible is an amazing
site with over 150,000 titles in all areas

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:24.510
of literature including fiction, non-fiction,
and periodicals. So you should check them

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.240
out. The link is in the doobly-doo, as John
would say.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.540
So I would like to thank Audible for supporting
me and I would like to thank you for watching.
