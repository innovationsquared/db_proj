00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.949
Due to the crazy technological challenges that had to be overcome in order to detect gravitational waves,

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:14.100
some people were skeptical that scientists had actually done it, that they'd actually seen gravitational waves from black holes - after all, there was no corroboration.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:22.049
But, after the discovery that's being announced today, there can be no more doubt, because scientists have detected the merging of two

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.709
neutron stars a hundred and thirty million light years away.

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.928
This is the first ever detection of gravitational waves from in-spiraling neutron stars,

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.699
and what's really exciting about this detection is that the same event has been observed with telescopes in all areas of the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.719
It all began on August 17th at 8:41 a.m.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.559
Eastern Time when LIGO interferometers identified a clear

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.520
gravitational wave signal that lasted about a hundred seconds, which is way longer than any previous detection, and it's consistent with

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.209
theoretical predictions for the signal from two merging neutron stars. ["hear" the sound of two stars colliding â™ª]

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.960
Around 1.7seconds later NASA's Fermi gamma-ray telescope identified a burst of gamma rays.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.249
For decades gamma-ray bursts have been thought to come from neutron star mergers,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.419
but the evidence has been lacking to know for sure that these gravitational waves and the gamma ray burst came from the same event.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.000
The key was to locate where in the sky this neutron star merger occurred.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.680
Unlike a merger of black holes neutron stars emit light when they smash together and continue emitting electromagnetic

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:33.809
radiation afterwards. The Fermi gamma-ray Space Telescope identified a large patch of the sky roughly the size of six thousand full moons.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.709
Using the European Space Agency's integral gamma-ray satellite,

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.970
they were able to narrow down that range. Now, the gravitational waves detected by LIGO allowed them to identify two long strips in the sky,

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.630
one of which overlapped with the existing search area. Now, interestingly,

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:55.529
Virgo, which is the newest gravitational wave detector, which is in Italy - it was online at the time,

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.280
and it should have easily been able to detect these gravitational waves, and yet

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.479
it saw almost nothing, and that was kind of a key clue, because it

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.860
indicated that the gravitational waves must be coming from one of that detector's blind spots. Every interferometer has some blind spots

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.720
where, if the waves are coming at that angle, it's symmetric

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.800
with respect to the two arms and so it just can't be detected. So this helped further narrow the search area down to the size of about

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.479
144 full moons. Now, within that area, around fifty galaxies were identified to be studied with optical telescopes, and

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.540
just 11 hours after the initial detection astronomers located a bright spot in the galaxy NGC 4993.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.080
You are seeing here pictures of the light from two neutron stars that merged

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.569
130 million years ago.

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.979
Watch how the color and brightness changes in the aftermath of the collision.

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.459
So what are neutron stars? Well,

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.729
they're the leftover cores of big stars that have exploded -

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.560
they've gone supernova. Now, those remaining cores are squeezed down by gravity

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.250
and if they're too big, say larger than two or three solar masses, well,

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.660
they will keep on getting crushed until they collapse in on themselves forever and become a black hole.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.460
But if those cores are a little smaller, say

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.920
1.1 and 1.6 times the mass of our Sun, as they were in this case, well,

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.920
then they get squeezed

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.780
still and so electrons merge with protons to form neutrons and

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.279
neutrinos and the neutrinos take off and the neutrons are left in a

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.920
really, really densely packed star.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.170
And the only reason the neutrons don't

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:39.219
combine with each other is because of a quantum principle, the Pauli exclusion principle, that basically says you can't put two of these particles

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.599
right on top of each other, and that's actually the only thing holding that neutron star up.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.250
So, if you have two of these neutron stars and they are orbiting each other, well,

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.289
then they emit some of their energy as gravitational waves, and as they do that

00:03:53.329 --> 00:04:00.159
they lose energy, meaning they spiral in closer to each other and when they get really close, say a few hundred kilometers apart,

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.369
the gravitational waves become intense, allowing us to detect them hundreds of millions of light years away.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.429
The collision of neutron stars creates a kilonova which spews debris out into space.

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.780
This is debris that glows,

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.700
allowing us to observe what's been created - and, in fact, the new observations with light telescopes have shown that heavy elements like gold,

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.089
lead and platinum were made in this event, and that

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.070
helps us understand where a lot of the heavy elements in our universe come from. In my view, this event really shows us that we're

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.849
in a new age of astronomy. We can detect gravitational waves, not just from black holes, but now from neutron stars,

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.799
we can use that information to locate places in the sky where that occurred and we can

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.510
validate that with our other telescopes looking in all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.250
So, now we really have more tools to understand our universe

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.260
and I just can't wait for the questions that we're going to address next and all of the different things

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.599
we're going to be able to study as the gravitational wave

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.820
observatories get better and better. It's a phenomenal time to be studying the universe.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.380
Outro signal.
