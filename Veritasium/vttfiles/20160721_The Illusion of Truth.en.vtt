00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.020
Research has shown that, if you're repeatedly exposed to the phrase:

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.900
"The body temperature of a chicken."

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.880
That's right. "The body temperature of a chicken."

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.600
Even if no useful information is given about the body temperature of a chicken, you are more likely

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.540
to judge as true this statement: "the body temperature of a chicken is 34 degrees Celsius."

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.100
It's not, by the way, it's actually closer to 41.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.300
But this finding highlights an important aspect of our psychology that plays a huge role in how we see the world

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.680
The things we're exposed to repeatedly feel more true.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.400
Now, the way this seems to work is through a mechanism called cognitive ease.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.780
Cognitive ease is a measure of how hard your brain is working.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.340
From easy, like when you're scrolling through Facebook,

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.720
To hard, like if you're trying to multiply 14 times 37 in your head.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.180
Things that are true generally elicit cognitive ease.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.000
Like "fire is hot", "earth revolves around the sun", "dogs have four legs", and so on.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.980
Not only do these things feel true, they also feel familiar. Effortless.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.140
And they feel good.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.240
All of these are outcomes of cognitive ease.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.200
Now, the trouble arises because cognitive ease can be artificially created in other ways.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.920
One way is just by repeating the stimulus.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.520
In a classic experiment at two Michigan universities,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.780
experimenters took out ads in the school newspapers.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.200
Each ad consisted only of one of these nonsense words

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.940
They were printed with different frequencies.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.000
One word appeared on the paper only once

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.620
while others appeared two, five, ten or twenty-five times.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.980
The word frequencies were reversed at the other unversity

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.240
At the end of the experiment, researchers sent out questionnaires

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.560
asking people to rate the meaning of each of these nonsense words

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.240
on a scale from "it means something good" to "it means something bad."

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.080
And the findings were clear.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.880
The more frequently the word had appeared in the newspaper,

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.160
the more people thought it meant something good.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.000
So, with enough repetition, even a nonsense word comes to feel familiar.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.540
It triggers cognitive ease and overall feelings of goodness.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.540
Experiments have shown that this also works

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.800
when showing English speakers Chinese charachters or even random shapes

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.080
And the finding is even more general than that.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.420
Songs are judged more favorably after you've listened to them a bunch of times than on the first listening,

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.720
and participants looking at yearbook photos judge the people in the photos as more likable

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.260
after seeing that photo more times.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.180
But that brings up the question, what are the Kardashians famous for?

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.380
Depending on who you ask, you may find that they're famous for nothing, or just famous for being famous,

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.820
but really they are famous for exactly the same reason anyone is famous, and that's because you've heard their names

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.380
and seen their faces over and over again.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.660
Now, they are familiar, you have experience  with them in the past, and therefore they are processed

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.260
with cognitive ease, which also feels good.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.500
This is at the core of the advertising industry.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.500
The idea that, repeated often enough,

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.680
Even "brown carbonated sugar water"

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.280
seems really appealing.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.500
But, maybe it shouldn't be surprising that

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.720
repeated stimuli are perceived more favorably.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.900
After all, our brains have evolved

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.340
to identify threats.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.060
And anything novel is

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.160
a potential threat.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.080
But, if after repeated exposure nothing bad happens,

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.600
it becomes familiar and comfortable and therefore

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.820
a sign of safety rather than a threat.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.120
And this general phenomenon extends beyond humans.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.920
Chicks who were played a tone when they were in the egg,

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.400
later made fewer distress calls

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.320
when the same tone was played to them as chicks.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.420
But repetition is not the only way to create cognitive ease.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.500
Images with higher contrast are perceived by the brain with more cognitive ease,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.000
making them feel good

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.640
which explains most of the Instagram filters.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.600
In another study, people who were shown images

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.980
where the outline was projected quickly and

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.900
imperceptibly before the image,

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.380
they started to smile and relax their brows

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.600
as measured by electrodes on these muscles.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.780
Videos with bad audio quality and low contrast

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.800
create cognitive strain as you try to figure out what's going on,

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.800
possibly searching for threats.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.500
You may not have noticed just now, but

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.280
Your brows probably furrowed and your mouth started to frown.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.420
Which is why we prefer high-contrast video

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.720
with crisp audio.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.560
And the same applies to text,

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.560
so which of these statements do you think is true?

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.820
Well, actually, it's a trick question.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.540
He was born in 1879.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.020
But, studies have shown that people will often choose

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.020
the more legible answer,

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.220
nice, contrasting bold text

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.840
is easier and quicker to read, it's handled with

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.820
more cognitive ease, and is therefore
judged to be more true.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.260
Lawyers with easily pronounced last names

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.480
are over-represented, higher up the chain in law firms,

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.640
even controling for rarity and ethnicity of the names.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.500
And even companies that have pronounceable abbreviations

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.500
on the stock market out-perform those

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.300
with unpronounceable tags,

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.300
which you'll be happy to know if you have stock

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.600
in those companies.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.940
And being happy, in fact,

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.020
that makes you more likely to experience

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.320
cognitive ease as well.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.500
This, in turn, makes you more intuitive.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.460
Try this: What connects these three things?

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.900
"cottage", "Swiss", "cake."

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.780
All English speakers recognise a unique solution:

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.060
Cheese.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.920
How about:

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.060
"sky", "bulb", "high?"

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.780
The answer is light.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.620
Now, not all sets of three words share a connection, of course.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.840
But, what's amazing is experiments have shown, people can determine

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.700
whether they do or not, in only a few seconds,

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.960
long before they figure out what the actual association is.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.040
This is due to the sensation of cognitive ease,

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.560
somewhere deep in the brain, these associations

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.420
cause a flicker of recognition,

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.980
which feels pleasant.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.760
It's the same reason why people say "to go with your gut"

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.980
on multiple choice tests,

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.200
if you're not exactly sure of the answer.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.480
Now, is this true or false:

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.060
"All roses are flowers,

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.700
some flowers fade quickly,

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.280
therefore some roses fade quickly."

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.760
"Yeah." "You can say that follows."

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.760
"One would think it would be true."

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.400
"But I got a feeling it's not."

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.240
The actual answer is "False."

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.680
Roses aren't necessarily the "some flowers" that fade quickly.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.160
A test using a similar set of three questions

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.920
found that 90% of people made at least one mistake

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.800
when the questions printed clearly.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.160
But when a test was printed like this,

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.920
the error rate dropped to 35%.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.440
Making the test harder to read actually

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.640
INCREASED the accuracy of reseults.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.860
This is because the illegible text creates cognitive strain,

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.600
forcing your brain to work harder,

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.600
and that helps avoid the pitfall and jumping to the intuitive, but wrong answer.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.000
Cognitive ease is useful for being creative and intuitive

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.640
but it also makes you more gullible.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.000
So for the written part of your driving test,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.300
going with your gut is probably a good strategy.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.680
But in areas like Physics where the answers are counter-intuitive and there are many common misconceptions,

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.540
it's important to be more skeptical.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.200
This vigilance takes effort.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.400
And it's also associated with being... unhappy.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.740
Have you ever noticed that some of the best scientists and analytical minds are grumpy and suspicious of everything?

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.320
I mean I think this could be more than just poor social skills

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.320
it may be essential for them to do their job.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.840
And this is a paradox of learning and critical thinking.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.820
Cognitive ease is pleasant.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.760
It is effortless, familiar, and it really does make you

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.260
more creative and intuitive.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.100
But it can also trick you.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.640
It may make things SEEM true that aren't,

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.440
and you may feel like you're learning when you're not.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.680
On the other hand, being skeptical and analytical takes more mental work.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.360
It's more confusing and it doesn't feel it's good,

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.060
but... it's the best way to separate fact from fiction.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.060
Now you might think that the point of this video

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.560
is to say that we only to think critically more often.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.140
But that's not it.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.020
As an analytical thinker myself, I find it takes me like

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.380
half an hour just to select a toothbrush.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.260
There are definitely times when cognitive ease is the appropriate mental state.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:42.220
When we evolve it for a reason, so we can react intuitively in familiar everyday situations.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.340
Why think harder than you have to?

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.240
So the key is to identify those times when more thought is required.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.000
But with sharing and repeating ideas,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.660
easier than ever before,

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.580
I think we need to be more vigilant,

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.480
to distinguish between those things that are really true

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.860
and those we simply have heard many times before.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.420
The more something is repeated,

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.680
the more it starts to feel true.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.720
