00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:07.330
I have a friend named Sammy who back in the
early 2000s wrote some code for his MySpace

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.330
page.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.999
And what the code did was anybody who visited
his page would have his picture and a tag

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:16.519
line that said, “Sammy is my hero,” copied
over to their homepage.

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:20.320
And that was a bit of fun for a while, but
Sammy wanted more.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.439
And so he tweaked his code so that no only
the picture and the tag line were copied over,

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.750
but also the code itself.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.109
And now it exploded.

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.270
In just nine hours he had reached 480 accounts.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.540
In 13 hours he was up to 8800.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.650
And in just over 18 hours he had hit a million
accounts, which was a full 1/35th of all the

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.400
accounts on MySpace at the time.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.220
So in a panic, he tried to delete his page.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.560
And when he was successful he actually took
down the whole of MySpace with it.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.440
He was arrested and convicted of computer
hacking and ordered not to touch a computer

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.540
for the next three years.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.190
But I think what this story really tells us
is just how connected we all are.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.690
Imagine you have 44 friends and each one of
those friends has 44 friends who are not also

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.870
your friends.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.940
And each of them has an additional 44 friends,
each of whom has 44 friends who again has

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.160
44 friends and they have 44 more.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.610
Then in a chain of just six steps you would
be connected to 44 to the sixth or 7.26 billion

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.890
people, more than are alive on earth today.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.280
And we have contemplated how closely connected
we area since long before MySpace even existed.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.550
Back in 1929 a Hungarian author and poet named
Frigyes Karinthy wrote a short story called

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.550
Chains.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.420
And in it, one of the characters challengers
the others to find another person on earth

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.870
that he cannot connect himself to through
fewer than five intermediaries.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.240
This is the origin of six degrees of separation.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.799
If the theory is correct, it means that you
would be connected to the Queen or Tom Cruise

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.620
in just six steps.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.420
But they may be the easy ones.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.020
What about this shop owner or the Mongolian
sheep herder?

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.340
What the theory really means is that any two
people picked at random from anywhere on the

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.670
earth would be connected by just six steps.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.180
The idea remained just fiction until in the
1960s a Harvard psychologist, Stanley Milgram,

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.650
attempted to test it.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.760
He called it the small world experiment after
that phenomenon where you are at a party,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.620
you meet a stranger and you find out that
you have a friend in common and you remark:

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.300
Oh, it is such a small world.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.040
What he did was he sent out 300 packages to
people both in Boston and in Nebraska.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.340
Now what he wanted those people to do was
try to send their package to a target person

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.620
in Boston, but they weren’t allowed to send
it directly to him.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.969
They had to send it to someone they knew on
a first name basis who they thought had a

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:52.340
better chance of knowing the target and they
could forward it on in the same way.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.700
Now, as you might expect, most of the packages
never made it, but 64 did and the average

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.439
pathway was 5.2.

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.959
So now six degrees of separation had experimental
confirmation.

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.269
Or did it?

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.340
If you look more closely at Milgram’s sample,
you will find that of the 300 people, 100

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.389
were located in Boston, the actual city where
the target lived.

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:19.769
Another 100 were stockbrokers, which was the
same profession as the target.

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.999
So only 100 people lived in a different state
and had a different job.

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:30.370
And of them only 18 of their packages made
it to the target.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.999
So we are talking about a sample size of 18
is all the evidence there was for six degrees

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:37.400
of separation.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.959
So experimental evidence was tough to come
by.

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.480
But a decade earlier, a mathematician named
Paul Erdos had tried to work out the theoretical

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.499
properties of networks like these.

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:50.930
But he didn’t have any information on the
structure of real social networks, so he decided

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.089
to work on networks where the connections
between nodes were all completely random.

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:59.530
And we can actually simulate a network like
this using buttons and thread where we just

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.139
connect up the buttons at random.

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:06.230
What Erdos found is that when the number of
links per node is small, the network is fragmented.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.980
Pick up any button and few others will come
with it.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.560
But once you exceed an average of one connection
per node, the behavior the network changes

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.709
dramatically.

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.340
They almost all link up forming a giant cluster.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.150
Now if you pick up any button almost all of
the rest will come with it.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.120
This change happens rapidly and it resembles
a phase transition in physics.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.210
Now you could call this a small world network,
since the path between any two buttons is

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.009
short.

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:37.300
The thing about random networks is that they
are naturally small world networks, because

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.610
you are just as likely to be connected to
someone here in Manila as you are to someone

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.140
in your own town.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.300
But obviously a random network doesn't represent
real life very well.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.990
So what do real world networks look like?

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.860
Well, for that, we need to go to the empirical
data.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.870
In 1994 a couple of college kids invented
a game called six degrees of Kevin Bacon in

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.009
which you try to connect any actor to Kevin
Bacon through just six steps through his costars.

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:09.150
Now a couple of sociology researchers got
access to their database of a quarter million

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.680
actors and they analyzed the network and what
they found was that it was a small world network,

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.050
meaning between any two actors there were
only a very small number of steps.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.340
And that is very similar to a random network.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.289
But unlike a random network, the actor network
also showed a high degree of clustering, that

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:29.530
is, they often worked together in small groups.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:35.490
So how do you get both this grouping behavior,
a high degree of clustering, and the short

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.509
number of steps between any two actors?

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:41.789
Well, to figure this out they looked at two
different extremes.

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.530
Imagine a circle of nodes.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.860
Now if you connect them at random you get
the same outcome as Erdos, short paths between

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.580
any two nodes, but little clustering.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.570
Now consider connecting up the nodes only
with their nearest two neighbors on each side.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:02.289
Now clustering is high, but path lengths are
long for two nodes picked at random.

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:07.789
But what if you take this set up and rewire
just a small number of connections randomly.

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:13.310
What you find is that the path length drops
rapidly, but clustering still remains high.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.370
So the key to modeling real social networks
is to have a lot of clustering behavior—that

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:23.880
is, your friends are also friends with each
other—but also to have a few random acquaintances.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.340
And the importance of those acquaintances
can’t be overstated.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.110
There was a researcher named Granovetter in
the 1970s who published a paper called “The

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.509
Strength of Weak Ties,” in which he points
out: You are much more likely to get a job

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:39.909
through those random acquaintances than through
your close friends.

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:43.450
And if you think about it, that makes sense,
because you and your close friends all know

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.419
the same people and have the same information.

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:51.139
It is through the random acquaintances that
you can get connections with people very far

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:52.219
from your social circles.

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:57.410
So you can find new jobs, new places to live
and you can be connected to the outside world.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.969
So, in fact, it is those random acquaintances
that make possible six degrees of separation.

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:03.969
So when I want to...

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:05.259
&gt;&gt; I am told the degrees have dropped in recent
years.

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:06.259
&gt;&gt; Really

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:07.259
&gt;&gt; ...to like four degrees.

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:08.259
&gt;&gt; Tell me about that.

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:09.259
How do we know this?

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:12.090
&gt;&gt; I don’t know how they measure it, but
I have tested it and I think it actually has

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.949
dropped based on how many people have friended
one another on Facebook.

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:19.800
The friendship circle has grown, not that
they are bosom buddies, but they are people

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.800
you have access to.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.800
That is the point.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.800
&gt;&gt; right.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.439
&gt;&gt; And it is... do you know this person who
then knows that so that I have access to these

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:26.439
other people?

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:27.439
So I am told that it has dropped.

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:30.979
As much as the six degrees, we are down to
four, at most five.

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:34.100
&gt;&gt; I think Neil DeGrasse Tyson might be right.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:38.849
In 2011 Facebook analyzed their data and they
found that 92 percent of their users were

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:40.979
connected through just five steps.

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:43.870
And that number is decreasing over time.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.860
The concept of six degrees of separation has
fascinated people for nearly a century.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:53.510
And I think that is not only because of how
counter intuitive it is, but also how comforting

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:59.220
it is to know how closely we are all linked,
not in some kind of abstract, ill defined

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.590
way, but through hard scientific data.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:08.360
Just six handshakes will connect you to anyone
else on the planet.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.160
Now I have a challenge for you.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.310
In the spirit of six degrees of separation
I want to try an experiment.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.439
I want you to try to get an email to me.

00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:19.539
But you can’t send it directly to me unless
you know me.

00:08:19.539 --> 00:08:23.099
So assuming you don’t, I want you to send
it to a friend of yours, someone you know

00:08:23.099 --> 00:08:27.279
on a first name basis who you think has a
better chance of getting that email to me.

00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:31.889
If your email eventually gets to me through
a chain of people, I will send you a postcard

00:08:31.889 --> 00:08:37.400
in the mail and I will tally up if we were
able to get that done in six links or not.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.270
So let’s try to do it and see if we can
connect.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:44.830
The instructions are in the description.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:49.270
This episode of Veritasium was inspired by
the Fine Brothers, Ben and Rafi Fine who are

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:50.310
friends of mine.

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:53.620
So we are connected through just one degree
of separation.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.390
Now they have a brand new TV series launching
on TruTV.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:01.560
It is called The Six Degrees of Everything
and it is a fast paced comedic show that tries

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.170
to show us how six things that we don’t
think are connected actually are.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.680
It involves sketch comedy and songs and reality
TV.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.650
I am really looking forward to seeing how
they are going to do this.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:16.160
So you can check it out Tuesdays at 9:30 or
8:30 central on TruTv.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.480
I am so looking forward to it.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.290
And thank you to the Fine Brothers for sponsoring
this episode so I could check out the science

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.010
of networks.
