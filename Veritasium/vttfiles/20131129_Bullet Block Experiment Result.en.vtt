00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.260
All right.

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.260
Let’s watch it.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:03.699
Hopefully I am not horribly wrong.

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:06.370
Derek is giggling to himself right now.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.460
&gt;&gt; Ok, you have made your prediction.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.870
Now it is time to find out which block went
higher, the one that is shot off center or

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.610
the one that is shot right into the center
of mass.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.720
Ok, we are just getting set for shooting straight
into the block.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.580
How are you feeling about this one, Dave?

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.590
&gt;&gt; I think this is the one.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:22.869
I really do.

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:23.869
&gt;&gt; Ok.

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.410
Range is going hot.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.050
In three, two, one.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.870
&gt;&gt; We have moved this block so now the gun
is actually firing into the right side of

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.870
the block.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:45.329
So presumably one imagines that the block
will spin anticlockwise.

00:00:45.329 --> 00:01:00.519
&gt;&gt; Three, two, one.

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.960
&gt;&gt; Now check out the high speed footage.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.030
You can clearly see that both blocks go to
the exact same height, even though one is

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.030
rotating.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.530
And that is a bit strange, because they were
both hit by the same type of bullet from the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.330
same rifle, so presumably it had the same
kinetic energy.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.390
And they both go the same height so they both
have the same gravitational potential energy,

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.800
but one is rotating.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.570
And so it has that additional rotational energy.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.720
So one block has more energy than the other
block.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.520
&gt;&gt; I don’t know if I buy that, Dr. Muller.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.520
&gt;&gt; Talk to me.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.229
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean so you are telling me you
just created energy.

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.810
&gt;&gt; Not necessarily created energy.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.140
So what are you thinking there?

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.050
&gt;&gt; I am potentially surprised.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.460
&gt;&gt; Shoot at the same height?

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.020
&gt;&gt; Obviously I am wrong.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:57.600
&gt;&gt; I think went up to the same height, which
is incredibly confusing to me.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.600
&gt;&gt; Why is that confusing?

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.890
&gt;&gt; Because that doesn’t... where is that
extra energy coming from?

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.780
&gt;&gt; Well, the fact is that one block clearly
does have more energy.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.760
You think about them both at the top, one
is spinning, one is not.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.530
They basically have identical gravitational
energy, but one does have additional rotational

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.530
energy.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.760
&gt;&gt; How is that possible and why is it happening?

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.760
&gt;&gt; No.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.699
Explain it to me.

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:17.979
&gt;&gt; I don’t want to give you the answer right
away.

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:18.979
&gt;&gt; I love it when you say that.

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:20.090
I don’t want to give you the answer.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.379
That means you don’t know.

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:22.780
I love that.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.630
&gt;&gt; So if you can make me a video response,
I would love that.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.090
Or if you just want to post your idea in the
comments below, that would be great.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.730
And I will reveal the correct answer next
week.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.409
So subscribe to the channel if you haven’t
already and you will find out in a week’s

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:37.409
time.

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.870
&gt;&gt; After I have time to pore over the footage
and consult a very smart man in the subject.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.139
That is what you didn’t say.
