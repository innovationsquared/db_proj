00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.740
Hey, Veritasium! Michael [Stevens] from Vsauce here, and we're gonna ask some important questions.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.260
Let's find some random bystanders...how about you?

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:12.480
Yes?

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.380
Michael: I don't believe you're scientifically literate.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:15.880
Okay.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.480
Michael: If a tomato is a fruit, does that mean ketchup is a smoothie?

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.940
John Green: So, can you name any of the cities in the Indus Valley civilization?

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.600
Are we talking about, like, Cairo?

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.060
John: (scoffs) Yeah, Cairo would not qualify as one of the cities in the Indus Valley civilisation.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.640
John: Cairo!...Cairo!

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.200
This is Brady Haran from Periodic Videos,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.560
and Sixty Symbols,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.960
and bibledex,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.700
and DeepSkyVideos,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.020
and Numberphile,

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.540
and nottinghamscience,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.480
and foodskey, and--

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.200
Alright, and I'm Derek from Veritasium.
and foodskey, and--

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.640
Alright, and I'm Derek from Veritasium.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.700
Brady: Wait, you only got one channel?

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.380
I know!

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.580
Brady: You call yourself a Youtuber?

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.680
Vi Hart, uh, you want to ask me a question?

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.320
Vi: Triangle.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.920
Um, that's not a question?

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.480
Vi: Triangle.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.300
(laughs awkwardly)
Uh...ah-um...

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.560
John: In what year did the French Revolution began?

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.680
17...72?

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.980
John: You had the--the first two numbers were awesome!
(Derek chuckles)

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.980
Brady: We have a Veritasium exclusive right now.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:24.120
We're gonna show you the first, unauthorized picture of CGP Grey, who's standing here right next to me.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.120
Here's a question for--oh.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.120
Hang on.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.300
He was here a minute ago.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.480
Henry Reich: Okay, so what I was thinking I might have you, uh, try to calculate here is some Feynman diagrams in curved spacetime.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.460
But to start off with something a bit easier, uh, I think we should start off with the Christoffel symbol for the Schwartzchild metric.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.380
Um, and in case you've forgotten I've written it, I've even written the metric here--

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.460
Derek: No, I know it--I know what it is. I don't need you to show me.
Henry: Okay.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.040
Derek: No, I know it--I know what it is. I don't need you to show me.
Henry: So like--

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.540
Derek: No, I know it--I know what it is. I don't need you to show me.
Henry: I know.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.680
Henry: You have something on your face.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.820
Vi: Triangle, triangle, triangle, triangle, triangle, triangle, triangle, triangle, triangle.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.560
Vi: Triangle, triangle, triangle...

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.800
I am actually quite concerned about what you're doing to my face.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.120
Vi: (laughs) TRIANGLE!
I am actually quite concerned about what you're doing to my face.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.140
Right, so this is CGP Grey and Veritasium at the BrainSTEM Conference here in Canada and it's been a great couple of days.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.200
You gonna come visit me Derek?

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.720
Definitely! I've always wanted to visit Great Britain.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.360
(CGP Grey sighs)

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.500
I mean...the United Kingdom?

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.840
England?

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.740
Derek: The British Isles?
CGP Grey: Great.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.620
CGP Grey: Great, yeah. I look forward to it.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.140
Going through U.S. customs in, like, an hour.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.340
(Vi laughs)

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.460
I was expecting, like, 𝘢 triangle, but this is feeling like lots of triangles.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.820
Vi: Well, they--they're happier in groups.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.500
Right.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.280
Vi: Like, they're like sheep. They get sad and lonely by themselves.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.880
Destin Sandlin: So, we're in the Corolla. I don't--I just met these guys.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.800
Henry: Look, look, there's like the Mennonite farms out there.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.920
If this car crashes right now, like, all of science on YouTube is going down.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.160
(everyone laughs)
