00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.740
I've been driving along Australia's famous Great Ocean Road.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.120
And I'm stopped here near the Twelve Apostles, which are these big sandstone bluffs.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.520
Actually, there's only eight of them left because the others have eroded over time.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.860
And erosion is really what's given us this coastline the way it looks now.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.260
So that brings to mind a question for me.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.080
Which is "How long is the Australian coast line?"

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.900
Well, if you were to measure it out in lengths of 500 kilometers,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.520
You would find that it's about 12 and a half thousand kilometers long.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:47.000
But the CIA World Factbook puts the figure at more than double that. Over 25,700 kilometers.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.680
But how can it be that we have two different estimates for the length of the same coastline?

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.920
Well this is called "The Coastline Paradox."

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.800
The answer is, it depends on the length of measuring stick that you use.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.260
So, if you connect up the dots from cliff to cliff to cliff

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.560
You get a shorter length of coastline than if you measure with a smaller measuring stick

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.480
And measure into every inlet.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.100
So what length of measuring stick should we use?

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.360
Well in theory, you can go all the way down to the size of a water molecule

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.800
And if you do that, then the length of Australia's coast is virtually infinite.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.580
Do you believe me that you could have finite area object like Australia bounded by an infinite perimeter?

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.600
It doesn't seem to make sense.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.520
But I can give you another example of this, it's called the Koch snowflake

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.620
so what you do is you take a triangle
with sides of length 1

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.120
and then on each side

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.830
add another triangle with sides of
length a third

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.400
Continute doing that again and again forever

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.759
What you end up with is a shape which is
a finite area but an infinite perimeter

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.060
shapes like these are called fractals
and many coastlines have the same

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.889
fractal structure which means they have
some sort of self-similarity on many

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:02.449
different scales so you can zoom in and
zoom in

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:04.659
and the coastline looks roughly the same

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.769
so if you want to know the length of a
coastline you need to first specify the

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.209
length of your measuring stick

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.150
because that's what the answer depends on.
