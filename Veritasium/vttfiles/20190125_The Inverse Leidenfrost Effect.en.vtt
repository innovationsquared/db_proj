00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.600
Now you've probably heard of the
Leidenfrost effect. That's when a

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.470
volatile droplet like water
levitates over a hot surface because

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.690
it's floating on a little cushion of its
own vapor. Here I'm gonna try to create

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.850
the inverse Leidenfrost effect where we
levitate a droplet on a bath of liquid

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.039
nitroge. It's inverse because the droplet
is not actually creating the vapor, it's

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.730
the bath beneath, it's the liquid
nitrogen that's creating the vapor.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.449
There have been a couple of recent papers
about this phenomenon so I called up one

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.290
of the scientists to ask how can I do
this and how does it work?

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.120
hello -hi -hi, how are you?

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.288
Good, and you? -I am doing very
well.

00:00:43.288 --> 00:00:44.520
So, I was gonna ask you, do you think I

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.090
would be able to replicate this without
too much difficulty? If you have liquid

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.250
nitrogen. yes. It's it's really simple.
it's really basic what you need is a

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.440
polystyrene box like 20 by 20
centimeters. A bit thick so that it insulates

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.250
and then I had two beakers one like that
size and another one that is smaller in

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.700
which the experiments... ah yeah. I will put him away

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.000
Um, so two beakers...

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.130
okay so when you
have a look at this setup I have a piece

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.470
of styrofoam that has a cylindrical
cutout in it into which I have poured

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.380
some liquid nitrogen and the purpose of
that is to get this outer space as cold

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.509
as possible and insulated from the rest
of the air. Then I have this large beaker

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.610
that is full of liquid nitrogen. As you
can see, it is boiling and then I have

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.890
the innermost beaker which is not
boiling so I have still liquid nitrogen

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.000
in the middle that is not boiling and
that is what I want because that is

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.409
where we can actually conduct the
experiment and try to get the inverse

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.860
Leidenfrost effect to work.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.820
Okay I have
100 microliters of silicone oil and I'm

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.690
gonna attempt to drop it onto this bath
of liquid nitrogen whoa oh my God look

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.739
at that. what?!
there were a whole bunch of droplets and

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.689
they were all levitating on the surface.
Now that they are in there now the

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.980
liquid nitrogen is boiling so this is
not good...

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.150
hey, future Derek here. Sorry my hair
looks stupid I'm gonna go get it cut

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.989
but that last experiment didn't go very
well because the liquid nitrogen in the

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.290
middle beaker was boiling and there was
nothing I could do about it so I tested

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.069
a few droplets on there but you couldn't
really see the effect nicely because of

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.510
that boiling bath so I'm gonna try again
today clean beakers new liquid nitrogen

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.530
let's give it a shot

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:56.760
there it is, got a droplet of silicone
oil and it is bouncing around back and

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.200
forth. That is pretty cool!

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.489
What's amazing
about this effect is that it can

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.469
continue almost indefinitely. It's been
observed to last for tens of minutes

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:11.549
unlike the Leidenfrost effect where the
droplet is used up making the vapor

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.079
cushion that supports it, here the
supporting vapor comes from the bath so

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.377
it can continue indefinitely even after
the drop has frozen.

00:03:20.377 --> 00:03:21.810
The heat required to

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.290
evaporate the bath comes not only from
the droplet but also from the warm

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.250
atmosphere around the experiment.
although on my second attempt I was able

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.510
to prevent the small beaker of liquid
nitrogen from boiling, my setup was a bit

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.720
unstable so the boiling in the outer
beaker shook the inner beaker

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.670
interfering with the droplets motion but
in AnaÃ¯s's professional setup you can

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.959
see how the drop always moves in
straight lines. But why should the

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.880
droplet be moving at all? and what keeps
it moving?

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.400
A lot of people have been putting drops on  a bath and have observed the

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.195
movements but nobody has tried to
explain it, like yet.

00:03:59.195 --> 00:04:00.920
So how did you explain it?

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.700
there is something that happens at the
interface so you have a floating drop

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.739
with a thin vapor layer above the bath
and then what seems to happen is that

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:16.130
this vapor layer is not uniformly thick
but then at some point there is a like a

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.720
tiny instability like a capillary wave
that grows under it.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.000
but why is there a wave?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.780
just for example because you'd
never deposit the drop perfectly,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.950
nicely and smoothly so you you create
tiny waves that come back below the drop

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.360
I think you can see that here as I add a
droplet to the bath. Notice the waves

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.220
generated in the middle of the beaker?
These little waves lead to an asymmetry

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.976
underneath the droplet where one side is
higher than the other.

00:04:46.976 --> 00:04:51.240
More nitrogen gas escapes out this side

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.490
Now you might
think this would drive the droplet in

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.470
the opposite direction but it doesn't.
the gas actually drags the droplet along

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.660
with it
kind of like how wind over your

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.380
windshield pushes raindrops along.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.340
What
is great here is that this instability

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.564
instantly reappears each time the drop
comes close to a wall.

00:05:10.564 --> 00:05:11.810
So when you have a

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:18.530
wall in the bath you have a small liquid
nitrogen meniscus so the drop starts to

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.550
climb it and then the propelling force
reverses and then pushes it back

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.520
And this creates a nice star pattern so
it's it's like self-propelled forever and

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.640
repelled from the walls which is which
is very cool

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.080
So do you think this

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.620
research has applications and what sort
of applications might those be?

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:43.380
if you imagine an embryo of an animal
like a mouse or something. A very very

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.640
young embryo is like 10 cells so it's
incredibly small. So what they do is like

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.550
they put it into liquid that allows
cryopreservation and then freeze it. and

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.210
and what is great about this is what
they do is they take the drop and put it

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.550
into liquid nitrogen and then it freezes.
what... and if the freezing is fast enough

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:09.120
you you don't grow ice crystals so you
preserve the embryo and what is

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.400
great about this is like if you imagine
instead of just putting an oil drop

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.830
like what I did is like you put an embryo with the cryopreservance on

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.930
the liquid bath then you can you can
make it into a canal like this and then you

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.300
can generate them like in a random way
and move them around because they are

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.080
self-propelled so they would go in the
direction that you want them to move so

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.430
you could imagine making something
where you could at the same time

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.250
freeze your cells or chemicals and then
move them along without generating any

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.370
contaminations because you're basically
not touching them

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.500
that's an interesting potential
application of this

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.970
hey this episode of veritasium was

Valley startup by John Carreyrou
it's the inside story of the company

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.640
thoroughness and its founder Elizabeth
Holmes she was this Stanford dropout who

became the head of a medical technology
company valued at around 10 billion

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.250
dollars but was her technology legit or
a massive fraud? if that sounds
