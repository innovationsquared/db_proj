00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.060
This video contains the answers to 
my four revolutionary riddles,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.300
so if you haven't seen the riddles yet, you should probably watch them before you watch the answers.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.760
It's OK; I'll wait.
Just click this card up here.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.660
[Ticking clock sound]

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.900
Now, when I filmed the riddles, 
I also filmed the solutions at the same time,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.860
but that was before I received your 15,000 comments and dozens of video responses,

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.560
so I'm re-shooting parts of this solutions video to incorporate the results I saw in the comments

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.580
and to use some of your video responses to help explain the solutions.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.700
Let's get to it!

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.780
OK, by looking at the comments, for #1,
over 15% of you said "a cylinder containing sand",

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.260
Now, this contains some powder.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.640
[Chuckles]
See how it rolls...

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.900
It, uhh, it doesn't seem to roll...

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.680
...very far before it stops,
and then it won't roll again

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.420
because I think the sand just kind of levels off in there.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.020
Maybe you were thinking a bigger kind of sand,

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.520
like these small gravely stones.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.520
Let's try that.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.860
That actually rolls pretty well.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.720
Nearly 25% of you said,
"a cylinder half-full of water,"

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.820
so let's try that.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.560
This rolls very well,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.700
so it's not water...

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.580
and nearly 45% of you said,
"a cylinder half-full of a viscous liquid."

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.180
Here, I have a half-full container of honey,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.360
so let's see how it rolls...

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.720
That's not bad;
it's rolling and it's stopping,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.420
and it's rolling some more...

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.100
This is a pretty good guess,

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.220
and I think the behavior is not exactly the same as the mystery cylinder,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.380
but it definitely is similar,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.360
and that's no coincidence.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.020
The mystery cylinder actually contains

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.980
honey...

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.380
and ping pong balls.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.680
There are two ping pong balls submerged in this honey.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.160
So if I place that on the ramp,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.620
the center of gravity is not above the point of contact with the ramp, and so it rolls forward,

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.640
but now, because those ping pong balls are in the front,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.620
they change the center of gravity, and so it's exactly over the point of contact,

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.660
and so it stops briefly,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.840
but then, as the viscosity of the honey allows those
ping pong balls to move up,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.180
the center of gravity shifts forwards again,
allowing this little container to roll.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.560
So that is the trick of the mystery cylinder.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.440
Pretty easy if you want to try it out at home.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.460
Now, I challenged you to run two laps of this track,
where the first lap, you could go as slowly as you like,

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.820
but the second lap, you had to go much faster,

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.600
such that your total average speed was twice
the speed of your first lap.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.540
Now, when I was first asked this question
by Simon Pampena,

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.040
it took me a long time and scribbling on paper,
and just something didn't seem to work out,

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.120
and that's because...

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.380
you can't actually do this.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.560
It's impossible.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:18.260
I mean, you might think I could run 3V₁ for my 2nd lap, and that would mean my total average speed is 2V₁.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.320
The problem is you can't just add the two speeds together and divide by two,

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.380
because you spent much more time in your first lap, so that speed is weighted more heavily into the average,

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.480
so you'd have to run, well, impossibly fast.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.380
Let me explain.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.020
The velocity of the first lap was the distance around the track divided by t₁, the time it took you.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.520
Now, if you want your total average speed to be 2V₁,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.840
well then it needs to be 2d ÷ t₁.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.880
You need to run twice the distance in the same amount of time it took you to run the first lap,

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.400
but you've already run that first lap, and so you have
no time remaining to run the second lap!

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.280
Even if you went the speed of light,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:05.600
you would not be able to increase your total average speed up to twice the velocity of your first lap.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.640
It is just mathematically impossible!

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.280
So this may seem like a bit of a trick question,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.480
but the point to me is how doable it sounds,
how it seems like something you should be able to do,

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.720
but you can't.
It's actually impossible.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.040
Riddle #4, the question about the train,

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.100
was actually answered pretty well, with most people mentioning something to do with the wheels,

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.640
but of course, that makes sense, in a series of riddles which are about rotation, rotational motion.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.060
Some people though did point out that maybe it was the steam that was going backwards,

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.480
or maybe air molecules in the train, 
and that is actually a pretty clever point,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.620
however I wouldn't really consider the air in the train part of the train,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.560
so indeed, the part of the train that is moving backwards

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.860
is the flange part of the wheel,
which is below the rail.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.940
That is the part of the train which is moving backwards.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.300
To understand why,
you just think about a spinning wheel.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.120
The top of the wheel is moving forwards at speed 2V,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.980
and the bottom of the wheel is not moving forward at all; it is stationary with respect to the track,

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.540
and that is what we call "rolling without slipping,"
and that's how most wheels work.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.400
At least, that's how they're designed to work.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:25.060
Now, in the case of trains, they have to have flanges so the train doesn't fall off its rails,

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.900
but of course, when these pieces come around during the rotation of the wheel,

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:35.440
they actually extend beyond the rail, and therefore,
they are going backwards with respect to the ground,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.620
so the part of the train that's moving backwards is always changing,

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.440
but it's always that part of the flange,

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.020
that part that extends beyond the wheel that is below the level of the track.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.140
So what happens when you pull
the bottom pedal of a bike backwards?

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.020
Well, about 45% of you thought that
the bike would move backwards,

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.640
about a quarter said it would move forwards,
and a quarter said the bike wouldn't move at all,

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.500
and 5% said it depends on something...

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.880
So let's give it a shot and see what happens.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.080
I'm going to pull backwards on the bike pedal
in 3, 2, 1...

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:16.520
Woah!

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.860
The bike did indeed move back,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.840
and for virtually all bikes, this is what you will find,

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.860
but the explanation is not just as simple as
"well, the net force on the bike is back,

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.340
so therefore, it has to accelerate backwards,"

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:35.280
and to prove that that logic doesn't work,
well, just have a look at this video by George Hart.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.160
[George] Watch this. 
Again, I pull the same pedal backward, but now...

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.400
the bike moves forward!

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.660
[Derek] I'll put a link to the full video here
and a link to his website in the description.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:51.760
So the reason the bike moves backwards is because of the way these gears are set up, the diameter of the tire,

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.020
and also, the distance from this crank to the pedal itself.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.420
Because as a bike moves forwards,

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:06.000
the pedal, even when you're pushing back on it, never actually moves backwards with respect to the ground;

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.060
it's always moving forwards.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.160
[George] So if you drag a string
behind the pedal of a bike moving forward,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.900
the string is always moving forward.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.440
Now just play that movie backward in your mind,

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.540
and it may be clear how pulling the string backward could make the bike move backward;

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.940
They move forward together,
so they move backward together.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.280
[Derek]
Another way to think about this

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.180
is to consider the path traced out by the pedal
as the bike moves forward.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.060
This is called the trochoid.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.860
For all ordinary bikes, 
the pedals are moving much slower than the tires,

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.780
so the pedal is always going forward
with respect to the ground,

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.240
but George modified his bike

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:46.760
so the ratio of the pedal to the wheel radius was greater than the ratio of the front sprocket to the back sprocket,

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.940
and this ultra-low gear changes the trochoid
so the pedal DOES actually go backwards

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.640
with respect to the ground as the bike goes forwards,

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.620
and that's why he could pull back on the pedal

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.840
and make the bike go forwards.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.380
This is the same reason why if you were to pull backwards on the flange of a train wheel,

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:10.180
you could actually get the train to move forwards,
if you pulled backwards with enough force.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:16.000
For all normal bicycles, pulling back like this on the bottom pedal will cause the bicycle to move backwards,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.260
but, depending on the gear ratio,
you can get the bike to move forwards,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.140
so it was those people who said

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:27.720
it depends on the ratio of these gears and the size of this crank to the radius of the back wheel

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.220
that were actually the most correct.
