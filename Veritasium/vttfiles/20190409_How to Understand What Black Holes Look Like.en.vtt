00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
On Wednesday April 10th 2019 you will
probably see the first-ever image of a

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.929
black hole. That's when the Event Horizon
Telescope will be releasing their

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.690
results and I haven't seen them yet but
I think they're going to look something

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.699
like this and I can be relatively
confident because well it's gonna look a

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.490
bit like a fuzzy coffee mug stain. But if
you are disappointed by this image I

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.769
think that misses the gravity of the
situation. From this image we should be

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.090
able to tell whether the general theory
of relativity accurately predicts what

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.430
happens in the strong gravity regime
that is what happens around a black hole

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.079
what I want to do here is understand
what exactly we are seeing in this image

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.670
so here is my mock black hole of science
and this sphere represents the event

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.489
horizon. That is the location from which
not even light fired radially away from

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.949
the black hole could be detected by an
outside observer. All of the world lines

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.490
end up in the center of the black hole
in the singularity once you're inside

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.530
here there is no coming back
not even for light. The radius of the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.570
event horizon is known as the
Schwarzschild radius. Now if we were just

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.479
to look at a black hole with nothing
around it we would not be able to make

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.290
an image like this because well it would
just absorb all electromagnetic

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.590
radiation that falls on it but the black
hole that they're looking at

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.549
specifically the one in the center of
our Milky Way galaxy, Sagittarius A*

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.060
has matter around it in an accretion
disk. In this accretion disk there is

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.149
dust and gas swirling around here very
chaotically it's incredibly hot we're

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.399
talking to millions of degrees and it's
going really fast a significant fraction

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.259
of the speed of light and it's this
matter that the black hole feeds off and

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.729
gets bigger and bigger over time but
you'll notice that the accretion disk

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.920
does not extend all the way in to the
event horizon. Why is that? Well that's

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.920
because there is an inner most stable
circular orbit and for matter around a

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.280
non-spinning black hole
that orbit is at three Schwarzschild

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.530
radii now in all likelihood the black
hole at the center of our galaxy will be

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.030
spinning but for simplicity I'm just
considering the non spinning case. You

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.510
can see my video on spinning black holes
if you want to find out more about

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.720
that. So this is the innermost orbit for
matter going around the black hole if it

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.920
goes inside this orbit it very quickly
goes into the center of the black hole

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.680
and we never hear from it again but
there is something that can orbit closer

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:54.770
to the black hole and that is light
because light has no mass it can

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:02.180
actually orbit at 1.5 Schwarzschild radii.
Now here i'm representing it with a ring

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.190
but really this could be in any
orientation so it's a sphere of photon

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.840
orbits and if you were standing there of
course you could never go there but if

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.350
you could you could look forward and
actually see the back of your head

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.960
because the photons could go around and
complete that orbit. Now the photon

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.090
sphere is an unstable orbit meaning
eventually either the photons have to

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.330
spiral into the singularity or spiral
out and head off to infinity now the

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.220
question I want to answer is what does
this black quote-unquote shadow in the

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.440
image correspond to in this picture of
what's actually going on around the

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.300
black hole. Is it the event horizon? Are
we simply looking at this? or is it the

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.980
photon sphere? or the inner most stable
circular orbit? Well things are

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.550
complicated and the reason is this black
hole warps space-time around it which

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.540
changes the path of light rays so they
don't just go in straight lines like we

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.320
normally imagine that they do I mean
they are going in straight lines but

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.790
space-time is curved so yeah they go in
curves so the best way to think of this

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.430
is maybe to imagine parallel light rays
coming in from the observer and striking

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.299
this geometry here. Of course if the
parallel light rays cross the event

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.210
horizon we'll never see them again so
they're gone that will definitely be a

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.000
dark region but if a light ray comes in
just above the event

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.160
Rison it too will get bent and end up
crossing the event horizon it ends up in

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.350
the black hole. Even a light ray coming
in the same distance away as the photon

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.770
sphere will end up getting warped into
the black hole and curving across the

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.700
event horizon so in order for you to get
a parallel ray which does not end up in

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:57.600
the black hole you actually have to go
out 2.6 radii away if a light ray comes

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:04.140
in 2.6 Schwarzschild radii away it will
just graze the photon sphere at its

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.840
closest approach and then it will go off
to infinity and so the resulting shadow

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:18.120
that we get looks like this it is 2.6
times bigger than the event horizon. You

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.460
say what are we really looking at here?
what is this shadow? well in the center

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.770
of it is the event horizon. It maps
pretty cleanly onto onto the center of

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.229
this shadow but if you think about it
light rays going above or below also end

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:39.330
up crossing the event horizon just on
the backside. So in fact what we get is

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:47.040
the whole back side of the event horizon
mapped onto a ring on this shadow. So

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.970
looking from our one point in space at
the black hole we actually get to see

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.100
the entirety of the black hole's event
horizon. I mean maybe it's silly to talk

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.479
about seeing it because it's completely
black but that really is where the

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:04.530
points would map to on this shadow. It
gets weirder than that

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.580
because the light can come in and go
around the back and say get absorbed in

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.890
the front you get another image of the
entire horizon next to that and another

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.610
annular ring and then another one after
that and another one after that and you

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.240
get basically infinite images of the
event horizon as you approach the edge

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.040
of this shadow. So what is the first
light that we can see? It is those light

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.700
rays that come in at just such an angle
that they graze the photon sphere and

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:36.510
then end up at our telescopes. And they
produce a shadow which is 2.6 times the

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:42.169
size of the event horizon. So this is
roughly what we'd see if we happen to be

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:46.939
looking perpendicular to the accretion
disk but more likely we will be looking

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:53.020
at some sort of random angle to the
accretion disk. We may be even looking edge-on

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.520
And in that case do we see this
shadow of the black hole?  you might think

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:01.699
that we wouldn't but the truth is
because of the way the black hole warps

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:06.740
space-time and bends light rays, we
actually see the back of the accretion

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.210
disk the way it works is light rays
coming off the accretion disk bend over

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.979
the top and end up coming to our
telescopes so what we end up seeing is

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:21.469
something that looks like that.
Similarly light from the bottom of the

00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:27.319
accretion disk comes underneath gets
bent underneath the black hole and comes

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.250
towards us like that and this is where
we get an image that looks something

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.100
like the interstellar black hole.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.100
it gets
even crazier than this because light

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:44.449
that comes off the top of the accretion
disk here can go around the back of the

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:49.339
black hole graze the photon sphere and
come at the bottom right here producing

00:07:49.339 --> 00:07:53.900
a very thin ring underneath the shadow.
Similarly light from underneath the

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.460
accretion disk in the front can go
underneath and around the back and come

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:04.370
out over the top which is why we see
this ring of light here. This is what we

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:09.319
could see if we were very close to the
black hole, something that looks truly

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:14.569
spectacular. One other really important
effect to consider is that the matter in

00:08:14.569 --> 00:08:18.740
this accretion disk is going very fast,
close to the speed of light and so if

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.039
it's coming towards us
it's gonna look much brighter than if

00:08:22.039 --> 00:08:25.669
it's going away. That's called
relativistic beaming or Doppler beaming

00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:29.509
and so one side of this accretion disk
is going to look much brighter than the

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:34.279
other and that's why we're gonna see a
bright spot in our image. So hopefully

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:38.089
this gives you an idea of what we're
really looking at when we look at an

00:08:38.089 --> 00:08:42.740
image of a black hole if you have any
questions about any of this please leave

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.699
them in the comments below and I will
likely be making a video for the launch

00:08:46.699 --> 00:08:51.920
of the first ever image of a black hole
so I'll try to answer them then. Until

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.790
then I hope you get
as much enjoyment out of this as I have

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.920
because this has truly been my obsession
for like the last week.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:02.900
I guess what

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:08.330
would be exciting is to watch it over
time how it changes, right? there's a lot of

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:13.040
hope that there are blobs moving around
and you know if you see a blob going

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.590
round the front and then it goes around the
back but you see it in the back

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:19.960
image etc then that's gonna be kind of
cool
