00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.700
Uh, we are driving to a very strange location

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.000
somewhere I have never been

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.780
and it's because of the woman in the back seat

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.560
This is Dianna, 'Physics Girl'

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.660
Yeah, uh, we are gonna go get a consultation, for something very special, right now

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.160
It is... look, I'm not gonna keep in suspense

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.300
Laser hair removal.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.340
We wanna talk about the science that makes laser hair removal work.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.800
I told him about this idea last, like, probably a year ago

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.080
and then I was gonna do it in July or August

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.040
I've been waiting for this moment

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.120
Now I'm scared.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.680
Now you're scared?

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.440
Here we go

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.500
Oh, yes

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.000
-Aw, it stinks, man
-It went directly into your nose

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.800
Yeah it did

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.820
It's called a "laser plume"

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.340
-Laser plume? Is that the smoke that comes out?
-It's actually a word for it. That's the smoke, yeah.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.660
How was that shot?

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.320
The laser we are using has a wavelength of 1064 nanometers,

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.540
meaning it is infrared radiation, invisible to the naked eye.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.540
But without an infrared filter, the camera's sensor picks up the laser pulses,

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.560
which in my case were six at a time, each one lasting about one and a half miliseconds.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.300
We dialed it up a little. We dialed it up just a tap though.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.200
-Nice
-Ready?

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.180
The laser will now deliver 25 joules of energy per square centimeter.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.060
That was beautiful

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.980
Ohhhhhh, wow!

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.540
Now we're talking

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.780
Wow, oh my God

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.340
-That is insane
-There's five bursts, did you see that?

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:59.700
Yeah, it looks like, like, a shootout at the O.K. Corral. That's what that looks like. All the hairs are just getting, like, slaughtered.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.040
That is amazing!

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.600
That is an awesome shot.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.300
That's really slick.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.040
I had no idea that it was a shootout at the O.K. Corral!

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.880
That makes me really, kinda, reignites my excitement about my job.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.240
That's awesome!

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.220
I'm gonna get even closer on this next one.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.180
That'll be cool.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.480
So what's actually going on here?

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.480
Well dark eyes, skin, and hair contain a molecule called melanin,

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.300
and melanin absorbs a wide range of wavelengths of light, especially in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum,

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.440
and this makes it an ideal shield against the sun's harmful rays, which is why you get a tan when you go out in the sun.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.380
That's your body producing and releasing more melanin in the skin.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.280
But, the idea with laser hair removal is to get the melanin in dark hairs to absorb the laser light

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.000
without the skin around it absorbing much of that energy.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.060
So, it actually works best if you have really dark hairs and light skin.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.940
Infrared lasers are commonly used because melanin absorbs in this part of the spectrum

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.880
more than other common molecules in the skin like water and oxyhemoglobin.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.480
Red lasers, at 755nm, are also often used for the same reason.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.040
As the melanin absorbs the laser energy, the hair heats up to well over 100 degrees Celsius,

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.480
causing it to burn and vaporizing the water it contains,

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.400
and this puffs the hair up a little bit like a cheeto.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.840
It's that expanding water vapor. Looking closely at this shot, you can actually see the bubbles on the hair

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.280
from the vaporization of water.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.660
But, the objective is not to destroy the hair, it's to actually use the hair to destroy the germ cells

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.560
in the follicle that produce the hair in the first place.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.120
So, it's kind of like using the hair to kill the hair.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.160
This image shows a cross section of three hair follicles following a laser hair removal treatment.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.840
The one in the middle contained little melanin, and therefore, shows no damage.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.740
The other two show the hair shaft has been destroyed, rupturing the inner root sheath

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.560
and damaging the outer root sheath.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.780
Cells suffer damage when their temperature rises above 60 degrees Celsius.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.740
This is because at that temperature, the bonds in proteins and collagen molecules start breaking apart,

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.800
and that's a process known as denaturation.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.800
So, the hotter it is and the longer that temperature is maintained, the more denaturation occurs

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.360
and the higher the likelihood that that cell will die.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.060
Now, if you cause enough damage to the cells in the follicle that make the hair,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.080
the hair will never grow back,

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.600
and that is the goal of laser hair removal.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.680
This sequence of ultrashort pulses is used to ensure that the heat doesn't spread too far

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.700
into the region surrounding the hair.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.440
So, the idea is the hair heats up, damages the germ cells right next to it, but then the laser light turns off

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.500
before that heat can spread too much further, and then you hit the hair with another very short pulse again.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.640
If you were instead just to keep heating the hair, it would heat not only the germ cells around it,

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.880
but also your skin that you don't want to damage, and you would end up with burns.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.280
So, that's the reason for the series of pulses that we saw.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.880
But, if you think about it, this is kind of a weird irony.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.240
I mean melanin is a molecule meant to protect us, meant to protect our skin

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.180
from harsh rays of sunlight,

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.460
and that's why it absorbs that light before it can penetrate further into your body and do damage.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:49.500
But now with laser hair removal, we're using melanin - it's unique absorption powers - against it.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.700
By overpowering it with lots of laser energy, we get it to heat up the hair to such high temperatures that

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.780
the hair kills the neighboring cells, the germ cells in the follicle that produce the hair .

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.440
So, we are using melanin's powers against it.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.600
Normally before a laser hair removal procedure, the hair is shaved

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.140
and that serves a few purposes.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.780
For one thing, not too much energy goes into burning the external hair, which does you no good

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.100
in the first place, and, second, it prevents the hot hair from landing on the skin and causing surface burns.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.320
Well, we found that shaved patches were less interesting to watch, because you can't really

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.200
see what's happening under the skin

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.340
After the creation of the first working laser, in 1960, it's inventor, Theodore Maiman,

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.940
called it, "a solution looking for a problem."

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.680
An unwanted hair may just be that problem,

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.320
because laser hair removal is the most requested cosmetic procedure.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.620
Hey, I have a lot of people to thank, who made this video possible,

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.680
like Diana, "Physics Girl," whose idea this was.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.920
Thanks to her, I no longer have that strange patch of hair in my shoulders.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.340
So, you should really go check out her channel, Physics Girl.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.660
And, I also wanna thank Darren. Without him at BeyondSlowMotion, we would never have been able to do this.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.500
He was simply amazing, so you should also check out BeyondSlowMotion.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:15.100
And, of course, I want to thank Audible, the leading audio book provider with hundreds of thousands of titles in all areas of literture including fiction, nonfiction, and periodicals.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.420
Whenever I'm out, I'm on the go, and I can't really watch videos, like when I'm driving, then I listen to Audible.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:27.680
I also listen to Audible when I'm on the plane, and I'm about to get on a plane right now and fly to Svalbard, Norway, which is nearly the North Pole

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.680
and that is gonna be a very long flight

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.860
so I will definitely be listening to, uh, my audio books. In fact, the audio book I'm listening to at the moment

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:42.000
is called Creativity, inc. And I am learning a lot from this book about how to be a creative person

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.880
how to be productive, and it's a great book to listen to because it's a story told by Ed Catmull, and you

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:53.740
kind of feel like he's there with you, telling you this story of how Pixar was founded and how they made creativity work.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:08:01.520
So, I'm loving that book. If you wanna check it out, you can actually download it for free, or you can get a free 30-day trial

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.780
by going to audible.com/Veritasium

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:09.240
You know, one of the reasons Audible keeps supporting Veritasium is because they know that the people who watch this channel like learning things

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.420
and another way to learn things, besides youtube, is to listen to audiobooks.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.900
So I highly recommend you give 'em a try, for a 30-day free trial. If you wanna do that go to

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.520
audible.com/Veritasium

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.660
Thank you so much for watching.
