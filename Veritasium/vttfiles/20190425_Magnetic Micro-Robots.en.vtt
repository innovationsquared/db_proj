00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.580
These are magnetic microrobots,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.860
just
millimeters in size.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.480
They bend and move in response to applied magnetic fields

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.800
And with these magnetic fields
controlled by a gaming controller the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.100
micro robots can be driven carefully and
precisely.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.260
They can turn by changing the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.820
direction of the magnetic field.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.560
Roll in a rotating field

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.660
And even grasp and jump

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.240
It often feels like you're playing a
video game.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.360
In some previous work I did

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.190
as a demonstration I was pushing blocks
of material around and using a micro robot

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.280
like a bulldozer.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.060
And the demonstration I
did was playing Tetris.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.780
The idea is this technique could be used
to assemble human organ tissues by

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.820
arranging blocks of different types of
cells in particular patterns.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.360
The way these scientists actually fabricate the
micro robots is pretty ingenious.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.700
Tiny rare earth magnets are magnetized in a
strong magnetic field.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.980
Then they're mixed into a UV resin that will harden when
exposed to UV light.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:35.360
The mixture is poured into a mold and placed on a stage
below which is a rotatable permanent magnet.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.720
This creates an adjustable
magnetic field to which all the tiny

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.220
magnets in the resin align.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.070
When the
desired orientation is reached UV light

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.220
cures the resin in one particular spot
locking those magnets in place.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.180
Then the magnetic field can be adjusted and the
next section cured.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.020
Ultimately the result is a flexible device with imbedded
magnets that have different orientations

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.860
depending on where they are.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.960
This pattern of orientations is what

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.820
gives these micro robots their unique
behavior in response to magnetic fields.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.380
If we can point multiple compass needles in opposite directions within a flexible
device,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.079
if we apply the field vertically

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.200
those compass needles will both try to
orient and align with that applied field.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.840
With the right magnetic fields the results can be pretty
sophisticated.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.060
Watch this micro robot

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.040
pick up a block

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.300
and then roll with it over to a ramp.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.460
It rolls up the ramp,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.440
deposits the block at the top,

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.580
and then
returns to its original position.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.020
The idea is that devices like this could be
used in medical applications.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.920
So this could be sending a device into fluid
areas in your body or into your

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.060
gastrointestinal tract. For example a
capsule that you could swallow which

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.380
will go passively through your GI tract,
have no wires attached and at the right

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.540
moment we can activate a sampling
chamber basically to open up and take

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.480
samples of either stomach or small
intestine contents, take biopsy samples

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.900
of the intestinal wall.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.830
But grippers like
these may not be the only magnetic

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.200
microrobots invading your body.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.459
A different research group has pioneered

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.480
these even smaller peanut-shaped
magnetic particles.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.320
And under the right magnetic field conditions they form
swarms.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.920
This warm can take on different

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.720
configurations: the vortex, where many
particles travel together like a school of fish,

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.560
the chain, where particles line
up and travel single-file.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.320
And the ribbon, where motion is perpendicular to the
line of particles.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.866
One potential application of micro robotic swarms is
drug delivery.

00:03:47.866 --> 00:03:49.359
Each magnetic particle

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:54.920
could carry a small amount of drug and
be guided toward the intended drug delivery site.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.459
So to make a swarm useful
for essential biomedical applications, you'd

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.380
like to keep the swarm aggregated.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.680
You probably will not be able to see single

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.760
micrometer sized particles but you could
see the entire swarm.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.980
So you'd like to keep it aggregated so you can move it
and keep track.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.740
But then going through

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.900
tight environments, for example going
through blood vessels

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.360
if your swarm, the overall swarm size is bigger than the
blood vessel then it doesn't fit so you

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.199
need to line them up and squeeze through
so that's the motivation for being able

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.200
to control the shape of the swarm.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.580
And, who knows, one day you might have swarms

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.320
of magnetic microrobots cleaning your
teeth.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.060
another group of researchers has used
tiny magnetic robots to clear biofilms -

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.060
those are communities of bacteria and
the protective sugar polymers around them.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.680
They typically build up on medical
devices, the insides of pipes, and on teeth.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.120
Can I ask, does this idea of
magnetic control of micro robots, does it

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.400
supplant previous concepts?

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.000
Like I'm trying to conceptualize this in terms of

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.889
like you know sci-fi futures with
nanobots where I imagine you know we

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.250
imagine these things as really
self-contained and you know powering

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.320
themselves around the body and that sort
of stuff.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.479
Yeah, great question. So the advantage of
magnetic fields is that it's a very

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.949
scalable technique. So we can make
magnetic microbots that are single cell

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:26.320
size and we can make them that are
centimeters in size and the principles

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.740
behave similarly.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.340
It pulls off a lot of
the functionality to

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.960
off-board magnetic coils. We can have a big
computer sitting there and power supply

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.840
It's a lot of the hard aspects of
driving a robot we can do as

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.440
traditional size. You can have a big computer

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.190
We can have medical imaging hooked up

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.000
and do all these things off board and
then on board we're just transmitting

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.680
the magnetic field directly to the
device and so this our micro robot is

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.180
basically then just like the mechanical
hand of the robot and the rest of the

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.300
robot is really sitting on the table
beside the patient.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.460

veritasium that's V E R I T A S I U M

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.340
to 500 500. Now if you're looking for
something good to listen to might I

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.390
recommend "How to Change Your Mind: What
the new science of psychedelics teaches

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:41.130
us about consciousness dying, addiction
depression and transcendence by Michael

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:46.169
Pollan. This is a fascinating book and
it's narrated by the author himself. I'm

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:49.710
actually listening to it at the moment
and he may be changing my mind about the

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:55.229
very nature of consciousness. What I find
so incredible is how recent this

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:59.620
scientific field is and what it's
revealing about how all of our brains work.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.300
Now when I'm listening to books
like this I actually look forward to

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.729
getting stuck in traffic.
I find it reduces my stress levels

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:09.810
because I'm learning something rather
than just wasting time in the car.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.350
Now the way it works with Audible is that as
a member you can choose three titles

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.729
