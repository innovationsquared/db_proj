00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.890
There is a misconception about chameleons
that they change their color in order to blend

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.200
in with their environment.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.549
That is actually not the case.

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:16.289
When a chameleon is calm it is green and so
it naturally blends in with its leafy surroundings.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.280
But male chameleons change color when they
become excited in the presence of a female

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.580
or a rival male, as shown here.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.200
I will put the first frame in the bottom right
for comparison.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.529
As you can see, as he becomes more excited,
his color changes to be more yellow orange

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:33.970
and red.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.000
So instead of blending in this chameleon will
now stand out.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.590
But how do chameleons actually change their
color?

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.680
For years we thought that there was a simple
well-established mechanism for this color

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.680
change.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.850
In their skin, chameleons have different cells
containing colored pigments.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.010
Some are yellow others are red and some contain
the dark melanin pigment.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.740
Many animals including chameleons are known
to turn a darker shade by causing the melanin

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.329
to spread out along the fingery extensions
of the cell.

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:08.509
They turn lighter again by condensing the
pigment back into one spot.

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.670
It was assumed that chameleons must turn yellow,
orange and red in the same way, by causing

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.679
those pigments to spread out in those cells.

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:20.789
But new research from collaborating groups
of physicist and biologists at the University

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.270
of Geneva shows that this is incorrect.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.549
Now the first clue should come from the fact
that there is actually no green pigment in

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:29.630
the a chameleon.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.249
The green color actually created by two distinct
mechanisms, pigment color and structural color.

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:42.319
Beneath the yellow pigment cells, there are
cells containing tiny 130 nm crystals regularly

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.099
arranged in a lattice.

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:48.460
Now light diffracts off these crystals and
due to the spacing between them, blue light

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.250
constructively interferes and is therefore
strongly reflected.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.030
Whereas the other colors are not reflected.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.849
This is very similar to how a morpho butterfly
wing creates an iridescent blue.

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:04.569
There is no blue pigment just the periodic
nanoscale structure that acts as a strong

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.299
reflector for only one color.

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.840
So a chameleon looks green due to the combination
of the yellow light from the pigment plus

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.120
the blue light reflected off the crystal structure
beneath it.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.670
So how do chameleons change this green into
yellow orange and red?

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.060
Well previously it was assumed that the color
change was achieved by dispersing pigments

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.810
in the colored cells.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.030
But now scientists have found it's actually
the crystals underneath which are changing.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.140
By increasing the spacing between the crystals
the chameleons can change which color is selectively

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.140
reflected.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.220
Bigger gaps between the crystals are better
at reflecting longer wavelengths.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.510
So as the spacing increases, the color changes
from blue to green to yellow, and then orange

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.180
and red.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.730
Scientists compared skin samples from calm
green chameleons and excited yellow chameleons

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.170
and found that indeed, in the excited chameleon
the crystal spacing was much further apart.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.630
Here you can see a single cell enlarged and
the color it reflects changing from blue to

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.000
green to yellow, orange and red.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.150
Plus, a computer simulation of the light reflected
off crystals while their spacing is decreasing

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.280
also provides excellent agreement with these
observations.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.540
Furthermore, applying physical pressure to
the skin causes the crystals to compress and

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.620
so they reflect more blue.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.819
When that pressure is removed, the crystals
expand again reflecting more green light.

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.120
The structure of a chameleon’s skin gets
even more fascinating, as there is another

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.820
layer of cells underneath which also contain
crystals.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.990
But these crystals are larger more spaced
out and more disorganized.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.320
This means they reflect longer wavelengths
in the infrared part of the spectrum and they

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.830
reflect a broader range of these wavelengths.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.130
It’s thought that the function of this layer
could be to reflect light from the sun since

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.880
these chameleons live in bright full-sun habitats.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.410
So male chameleons don't change their color
by spreading out red and yellow pigments.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.030
Instead they do something much more remarkable.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.319
They actively tune the spacing between nanoscale
crystals in order to create structural colors

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.700
that span the whole length of the visible
spectrum.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.930
Now what I find amazing is that in this day
and age we thought we had the answer to how

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.900
chameleons change color, but it actually took
the combined expertise of physicists and biologists

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:35.780
working together to figure out what's really
going on.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.050
This episode of Veritasium was supported by
Linda.com a leading online learning platform

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.900
with over 3000 video courses taught by experts
in areas ranging from video production to

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.500
web development and computer programming.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.569
Chances are if you can think of a topic, they
have a course that teaches it.

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:58.430
Now as part of this sponsorship they are offering
Veritasium viewers a 10 day free trial of

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.710
any and all courses on the site.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.840
Just go to Lynda.com/Veritasium or click the
link in the description.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.960
You know one of the courses I’m really interested
in is Adobe After Effects.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.949
That’s a really good animating software.

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.849
Right now I still do all of my animations
including the ones in this video in Final

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.469
Cut Pro which is really tedious and time consuming.

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:21.000
Now if you’re interested in learning how
to program maybe you should try out their

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.340
Java courses.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.800
Those are really good.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.300
Or if like me you’ve always wanted to do
more with Photoshop, you should try out one

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.939
of their Photoshop or photography courses.

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:34.001
So if you want to learn something new today,
you should go to Lynda.com/Veritasium for

00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:35.330
10 days free trial.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.969
There’s really nothing to lose me.

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:40.680
I really want to thank Lynda.com for supporting
me, and I want to thank you for watching.
