00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.370
I want to show you how to color a transparent
piece of plastic without adding anything to

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.800
it, no dyes, paint, nothing except holes.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.740
But first we have to talk about light.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.790
Most people know that it is a form of electromagnetic
radiation.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.850
But have you ever stopped to think about how
strange that is?

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.380
I mean, light is a combination of electric
and magnetic fields.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.810
Electric fields like the ones that make these
balloons repel and magnetic fields like the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.910
ones that make these magnets attract.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.829
But how can you strip off the electric field
from around charge and the magnetic field

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.090
from around a magnet and combine those fields
together so that they can propagate out through

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.629
space at the speed of light?

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.770
Well, the key is the electric and magnetic
fields need to be continuously changing and

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.060
this is usually accomplished by wiggling some
electrons.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.860
That creates these oscillating electric and
magnetic fields that propagate out through

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.990
space as an electromagnetic wave.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.520
So how big is a wavelength of visible light?

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.890
Well, take a ruler and have a look at a millimeter.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.540
Imagine magnifying that millimeter so that
it is the size of a meter.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.970
Now divide that millimeter into a thousand.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.180
Or, in other words, take a millimeter of a
millimeter and then divide that in half and

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.490
that is the wavelength of green light.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.460
Now, granted, that is tiny, but my point is,
it is not that tiny.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.040
And nature has actually figured out a way
to take advantage of the size of light.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.070
Have a look at this blue morpho butterfly.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.630
&gt;&gt; What is really neat about the blue morpho
is, yeah, it has this really blue iridescent

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.630
shiny wings.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.802
But nobody really actually knows why they
are this way.

00:01:39.802 --> 00:01:41.350
&gt;&gt; You mean it is to attract a mate or something?

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.080
&gt;&gt; The leading theory that I have read is
actually to let predators know, like birds,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.740
that, hey, you know me.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.740
I am really fast.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.490
I move really well through the jungle.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.580
Don’t even bother.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.640
&gt;&gt; That beautiful iridescent blue color isn’t
created by a pigment.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.579
No, .the color of the blue morpho is created
by the structure of its scales.

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.900
If we were to zoom in on this butterfly we
would see all these little sort of gratings

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.590
and holes within these gratings that trap
the light and reflect out this blue.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.140
And if we just kind of look at it, direct
into the light...

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.190
&gt;&gt; So we have taken away the light that was
bouncing off the front.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.210
You can see that the blue goes away and all
you can see is really the back of it.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.260
And, in fact, that is because the wings are
almost transparent.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.080
Without that light being able to reflect off
of it, you don’t get any blue.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.250
&gt;&gt; Scientists like Flint are trying to create
similar structures to be used as security

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.319
devices on bank notes, bank cards and tickets.

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.650
&gt;&gt; What you are looking at is the thin transparent
piece of plastic and we have punched little,

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.650
tiny holes.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.140
The holes are about 100 nanometers deep and
about 100 nanometers in diameter.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:54.010
Each little image that you use on there has
about 500 million holes punched into it.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:01.500
And those holes create a three dimensional
kind of grating that allow for the light to

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.480
reflect and reflect out and create those brilliant
colors.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.050
&gt;&gt; The color is created in a similar way to
the color of a soap film.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.950
If you carefully study a soap bubble, our
will notice that you can’t see all the colors

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.879
of the rainbow in the soap film.

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.980
All you can really see is cyan, magenta and
yellow.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.370
But the reason or that is what the soap film
is doing is it is actually removing colors

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.380
from the light.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.330
So the full spectrum of visible light hits
the film, but depending on the thickness of

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.989
the soap layer, certain colors are removed.

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.670
And so what we see is the spectrum of visible
light minus a color that has been taken out.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.440
So, for example, in order to see magenta,
what we need to do is remove the green light

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.599
from the spectrum.

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.710
The light that bounces off the front surface
will interfere with the light that bounces

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.980
off the back surface of that soap film.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.519
So when it comes out, any light that is about
500 nanometers is removed from the light.

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.569
And what we see is a mixture of the rest of
the spectrum.

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.830
So longer wavelengths than green and shorter
wavelengths than green.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.650
Together they make that beautiful magenta
color.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.700
&gt;&gt; So what you want to look for is structures
that are similar but can be compatible with

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.700
manufacturing processes where, for example,
a printing press process where you have a

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.790
big roll of substrate.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.669
It is going to come along and you have got
a big press that is just going to stamp down

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.120
and punch in those structures.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.850
&gt;&gt; But how could you create like nano scale
structures and punch them into a material?

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.230
Isn’t that nearly impossible?&gt;&gt;

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.610
No, not at all.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.582
&gt;&gt; But it sounds like you are going to manufacture
these tiny things and then they are not going

00:04:30.582 --> 00:04:32.120
to break off when you stamp into it.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.310
&gt;&gt; No and that is the only thing everybody
thinks is, you know, oh, they are small.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.540
And small things are fragile.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.540
That is just the case.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.820
One of the reasons that our structure can
be strong is that it has a low aspect ratio,

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.139
which means that the height to width is low.

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.750
So a high aspect ratio, let’s say, might
be 10:1.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:51.750
So it is long and skinny.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.540
And that is a weak structure.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.310
Ideally you want a structure that is 1:1 or
maybe 1:2.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.660
And what we do is we create structures that
are 200 nanometers wide and, maybe, 300, 400

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:03.720
nanometers tall.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.630
And we use that to punch in.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.069
And those structures are really, really strong.

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:12.039
&gt;&gt; For the moment Australian bills are made
of plastic and they have this little transparent

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:14.520
window in them to stop counterfeiters.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.900
But perhaps in the future they will have hundreds
of millions of tiny nano scale holes instead.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.570
&gt;&gt; The Australians were the ones that, you
know, invented the polymer bank note.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.449
&gt;&gt; So would you be looking to get your technology
in there?

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.470
Have you been in dialog with the Australians?&gt;&gt;

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:33.540
I cannot comment on that.
