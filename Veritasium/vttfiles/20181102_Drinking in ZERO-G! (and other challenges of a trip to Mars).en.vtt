00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
What would it be like to travel to Mars and be one of its first colonists? well to get a small taste

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:09.629
National Geographic is sponsoring this video and sending me on a

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.929
Microgravity experience - a vomit comet

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:22.109
Come on this plane flies in a series of parabolic arcs so that if and everything inside can essentially be in freefall

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.600
creating a microgravity environment

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.459
the plane can also simulate the gravity on other bodies like the Moon and Mars

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:37.648
by modifying the parabola if I were really going to Mars I would experience not 30 seconds of microgravity as I do in this

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.829
plane but eight months of it and then when I got to Mars this would be the gravity on the surface

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.559
This is what it would be like to be on the surface of Mars there the gravity is only about

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.309
37%

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.769
of what it is on earth which means you'd be able to jump

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.170
Much higher if you're an

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.580
Average jumper on earth you get double the airtime on Mars and have no problem at all dunking on a regulation basketball hoop

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.350
The

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.680
Moon, the gravity is only

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.919
1/6 of what it is here on earth so you could really do a lot of

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:27.689
crazy

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.309
aerobics without being exhausted one major issue

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.780
With low gravity is that it's not very easy to exercise. I mean you're used to the fact that your arm weighs about

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.039
5% of your body weight so just

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.919
Lifting your arm and regular G is a little bit of a workout you don't get any of that

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.039
when you are

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:53.958
Traveling to Mars and you only get a fraction of it when you're actually on Mars on a journey to Mars as on the space

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:58.189
station your muscles would weaken and shrink they would atrophy

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.119
Studies have shown that muscle mass can decrease by up to 20%

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.268
On space flights lasting just 5 to 11 days so you'd have to exercise

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.629
lifting weights would be useless

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.310
So you'd have to rely on

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.170
Elastic resistance for example on the space station astronauts are

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:23.629
elastically tethered to a treadmill and they typically exercise two and a half hours everyday

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.569
Even so the lack of weight pushing on bones results in a decrease in bone density

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.139
Astronauts can lose one to two percent of bone

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:40.849
Mass per month mostly in their lower extremities that's over 10 times faster bone loss than people on earth experience through

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.709
Osteoporosis as they get older and in weightless conditions other forces become significant like the surface tension of water

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.659
everyday activities become a lot more challenging, even things like washing your face Oh

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.750
probably gonna hat

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.080
That is crazy look at the surface tension the water holds it together like that

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:17.229
Dealing with liquids and microgravity is really difficult which makes showering brushing your teeth and going to the bathroom much harder

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.110
it's one of the most challenging things

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.859
I got just gonna up my nose

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.659
Got it in the absence of Earth's gravity you would

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:59.349
Also notice some strange effects like what happens when I spin this I showed how on earth this disc flips

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.349
Heaviside up when you spin it so I wanted to see what happens in microgravity right here

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.370
Do you see it flipping back and forth

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.390
did you see that

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.149
let me slow it down so you can see it better the disc actually flips back and forth

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.269
The hole goes from one side to the other and back

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.709
Watch which side of the disc the hole is on first its facing towards me and then it flips away from me and

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.000
Now it's towards me again and now it's away from me

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:34.300
This effect has

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:41.349
actually been seen on the space station with a t-bar handle it's an example of the intermediate axis theorem that is

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.269
Rotation about an intermediate axis not the least or a greatest moment of inertia is

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.510
Unstable and any tiny disturbance will cause it to rotate about another axis as well

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:56.529
in addition to dealing with microgravity on a trip to Mars you would

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.860
also

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:04.210
Be exposed to significant amounts of radiation when it's bedtime on orbit normally you fall asleep pretty quickly because because you're tired

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.409
but once in a while you have your eyes closed and you're not asleep yet and

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.479
you occasionally will see a flash of light it's some sort of

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.870
Human body reaction to the radiation from the universe

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.439
And we think it is heavy particles or

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.800
individual

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.659
Bursts of energy coming from radiation that are either going through the eyeball itself

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:35.709
Or going through the optic nerve a picture back to the first astronauts who must have closed their eyes and seen that radiation and going

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:38.259
I'm not going to tell anybody about this because

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.849
No, one's told me about I'm not talking I can just imagine the first two guys that said hey

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:46.899
I am sometimes I see flashes of light do you see flashes of light and then

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.169
Oh, we all see flashes alike. Oh okay, well that's that's alright then

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.700
to me all of these difficulties represent not deal breakers but challenges to be overcome for

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:05.060
Humans to guarantee our long-term survival we must become a multiplanetary species on mars

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.199
Simply stepping into a spacesuit which currently weigh as much as

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.000
310 pounds would make you feel about as heavy as you are on earth

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.789
So, maybe you wouldn't feel like a basketball star after all but this would

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.879
also, allow you to maintain your muscle and bone mass

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.660
it's not that hard to shield yourself for radiation you can put it into the

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.499
Insulation of the ship you can use water of course it's a terrific radiation

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.060
Absorber so you can shield the ship but you can't ignore it and of course

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:43.939
One of the major challenges of different gravity is the nausea that it brings our bodies are not necessarily

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.659
evolved to be these different gravity situations

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.300
so, we've just gone through 50 parabolas I don't know if I could last many more before I start to

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.540
Lose, my breakfast you know what I'm saying

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.980
but you know our bodies evolved for millions of years in

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.980
9.8. M/s^2 gravity

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:11.480
if we ever moved to Mars then actually established qualities and live there our evolution may take us in

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
very different directions

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:21.260
Thanks to the National Geographic Channel for sending me on this zero-g. Adventure it's truly awesome

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:32.390
Life on Mars may be closer than you think check out national Geographics new season of Mars on Monday November 12th at 9/8 central
