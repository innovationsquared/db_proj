It's august 21st 2017 the day of the total solar eclipse. I'm in Madras, Oregon

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.750
the skies are clear

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.729
My sky tracker. It's meant to move the camera with the sky so it

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.090
Compensates for the Earth's rotation that should help me keep the sun in shot as the eclipse is taking place

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:39.149
We have first contact this is C1. You just see the moon entering on the top right side

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.500
We are 17 minutes out from totality and I think the light is starting to change. I think it's getting noticeably dimmer

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.880
There's a bit of like a cold wind coming in from this side. Can you guys feel it?

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.470
It's getting kind of cool, and it's getting darker. I'm really excited

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.229
Now that the sun is about 90 percent covered. I'm seeing much sharper shadows.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.099
Normally shadows, They're a little bit fuzzy because the light from the sun is coming from a whole bunch of locations.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.500
But now because it's coming from basically one little sliver of the sun the shadows are all getting very.

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.229
very sharp, oh.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.390
my God, oh.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.840
my God, ah.

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.928
Look around the treasure. This is insane right now. Oh.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.620
This is just unbelievable,

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.620
What is happening? This is absolutely insane like it's like- the breeze.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:41.240
Oh my God, this is totally creepy. Oh!

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.969
My goodness, this is weird. Oh!

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.110
my goodness!

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.509
There's like sunset - sunrise every direction people are going nuts!

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.339
This I did not expect. I don't know what I expected, but... Oh my God!

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.269
This, just looks so wrong.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.779
You can see these prominences the solar Corona coming out at the top left and right at the bottom I

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.039
I can see Venus directly above me.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.600
oh... what!

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.120
What is this?

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.999
What? I just don't even know?!

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.529
We are inside Totality.

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.100
I just, I am kinda speechless.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.020
Hey, it is. Just unreal right now

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.340
It's totally nuts

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.060
*Background* It's like a hole in the sky!

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:25.420
*Loud cheering*  (as diamond ring effect appears)

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.700
Our excitement is that the sun is back.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.940
Gonna pop the solar filter back on.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.020
Just want to say a huge. Thank you to my patreon supporters

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.529

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:08.010
for the equipment that kept my camera tracking with the sun and the solar filters on the front and yeah

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.790
Basically everything I needed to get here and see this total solar eclipse, so thank you so much for supporting me

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.859
