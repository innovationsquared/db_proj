00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.460
What do this satellite thruster, plastic
tool, and micro mechanical switch have in common?

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.000
Well they all contain components
that bend, so-called compliant mechanisms

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.840
This episode was sponsored by SimpliSafe. More about them at the end of the show.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.750
Now about a month ago I was giving
a talk in Utah

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.460
hence the suit and that's where I met
this guy, -Larry Howell professor of mechanical engineering.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.600
So it's always been considered to be bad to have

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.289
flexibility in your in your machines.
Well we've tried to take that that thing

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.510
that everybody hates, that is trying to
avoid and say how can we use flexibility

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.110
to our advantage? how can we use that to
do cool stuff?

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.160
Now Professor Howell literally wrote the
book on compliant mechanisms -that's the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.240
most cited book
-but he's pretty nonchalant about his work

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.289
just watch how he introduces this mechanism he developed to prevent nuclear weapons

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.960
from going off accidentally:

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.360
actually in safing and arming of nuclear weapons.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.560
And so if... 
-What?
-Yeah

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.920
And so if you want....
-Hang on, hang on hang on

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.120
What-ing nuclear weapons?
-Safing and arming

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.780
Safing and arming 
-yeah so if there's anything in

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.920
the world that you want to be safe it's
not going to accidentally go off

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.630
I feel like this is - it doesn't even need saying
but yes nuclear weapons obviously you don't

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.320
want them to go off. What I don't
understand how this is gonna keep the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.380
nuclear weapons safe.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.009
Now I want to come
back to this device and explain how it

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.869
works once we understand why compliant
mechanisms are best suited to this task

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.320
[that's cool] So let's start with
something basic.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.990
Probably the first

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.409
compliant mechanism I ever designed was
this thing. What it is is a compliant

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.420
mechanism that is a gripper so you can
put something in there and it will get

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.420
actually a really high force. I can put
that in there and and it breaks the chalk

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.409
What have you put your finger in
there and squeeze it? You would scream in

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.520
pain, would you like to try? -I would like
I would actually like to feel the force

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.760
OK, you need to squeeze it yourself though or it's...
-Really?

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.480
well all right, I'll squeeze until you scream in pain

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.180
Aaahh hahaha

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:16.560
That very quickly got incredibly painful it felt
like having my finger like in a in a vice.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.740
That looks suspiciously like vice
grips but now with these flexible

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.740
components where the hinges are.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.840
What I learned in my visit with Professor Howell

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.260
is that compliant mechanisms have a
number of advantages over traditional

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.690
mechanisms but I thought he needed kind
of a clever pithy way to remember all of

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.180
these advantages. So I came up with the
eighth P's of compliant mechanisms and

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.489
the first of those is Part count.
Compliant mechanisms have reduced part

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.360
count because they have these bendy
parts instead of having things like

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.000
hinges and bearings and separate springs.
This gripper is just a single piece of

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.290
plastic but achieves a similar result to
the much more complicated vice grips.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.180
Like how much does it amplify the force?
This will get about thirty to one so I

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.560
could get for one pound force in, get
thirty pounds out. That's pretty good

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.230
It seems like that would be super cheap 
-and really inexpensive so this we just made

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.359
here in our shop but you can imagine
also injection molding that

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.280
- that would cost like cents 
-yep this would cost cents

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.730
the other thing is because of its shape

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.760
you could extrude it and then just chop
them off and that would be cool.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.239
So the simple design allows

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.430
different production processes to be
used which lowers the price these

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.880
switches for example achieve in one
piece of plastic what is normally done

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.480
with springs, hinges and many rigid
plastic pieces

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.360
also a good fidget device

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.040
how long can these last?

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.590
-we've had these in
our fatigue testing machine. We've been

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.432
able to go over a million cycles without
failure

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.820
What have we got there?

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.180
All right, Derek I've got a quiz 
-uh oh

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.240
quiz for you okay, I'm gonna 
-elephant I'm gonna

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.480
Very good!

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.820
okay I'm gonna push on elephant's rump
this direction okay? I'm gonna hold this

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.440
and that little dot right there, is that
dot when I push on it, is it gonna go

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.840
left, right, up or down?

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.160
Um...

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.100
I just you know what I wanted to guess
without even thinking about it?

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.220
Yeah, please do.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.310
I'm gonna say like up and in -okay 
-and I kind of feel like that because like

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.060
that would be a logical way for an
elephant to hold its trunk -okay

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.560
but also because like

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.700
if this is all going over then I feel like
this is gonna kind of extend there and

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.700
that's gonna get pushed up in there.
- ah, good thinking

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.630
well I don't know is that

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.320
good thinking? that's well it's
thinking at least so... this is designed

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.640
so that when you push on that it
actually just rotates in space it

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.860
doesn't move at all.
-I knew you were gonna pull some sort of trick

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.100
it's a trick question!

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.020
now since I was fooled by it I
had to try it out on my friend the

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:01.260
physics girl. That's so trippy. That is so cool! I don't understand - what?!

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.740
it's modeled after the mechanisms you use in

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.590
wind tunnels where you want to have say
a model that's that's attached here but

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:15.410
you move it and all you want to do is is
control its its angle and move it around

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.140
in a wind tunnel. don't displace it but be able to change the angle.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.780
Devices like this demonstrate that
compliant mechanisms are capable of

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.670
producing very precise motion, which I
personally found pretty counterintuitive

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.560
because these objects are made up of
flexible parts

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.200
but maybe that shouldn't

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.400
be surprising because compliant
mechanisms don't suffer from backlash

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.400
for one thing.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.390
So backlash occurs when
you have a hinge which is basically just

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:47.090
a pin in a hole and it's moving in one
direction and now if at some point the

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.200
motion reverses it doesn't happen
instantaneously because there's some

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.920
give in the hinge.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.710
This also causes wear
and requires lubricant and that is why

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.900
compliant mechanisms have better
performance than their traditional counterparts.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.240
This one though is my favorite. 
That is is one of my favorites too.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.340
It's just so pleasing, right?

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.784
Ahhh, that sound is so satisfying.

00:06:13.784 --> 00:06:18.290
This actually, believe it or not was inspired when we
were doing things at the microscopic

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.590
level, where we're building compliant
mechanisms

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:27.760
on chips. We had to be able to make these
compliant mechanisms out of silicon,

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.960
which is as brittle as glass. 
-mm hmm

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.930
And if you're trying to make something like

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:38.080
this out of glass, right? it's it's crazy
hard but that also means once we figured

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.360
out the design we could make it in a
material even like PLA which is also you

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.260
know not the ideal compliant mechanism
material.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.010
So you can get on our website

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:53.530
and get the material... and get the files to
make this yourself I'll put a link in

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:58.000
the description ya- that also has a nice
feel and I snap to it has a really nice

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.320
snap I like when it comes out, it's like
'gunk' you know like there's something

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.040
about that that's really it's very
pleasing.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.370
So these things actually move?

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.740
oh yeah, yeah yeah 
-I need to see this

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.780
okay all right we'll do it

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:16.210
were those etched on there?
- yeah those are etched and so just using the same

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.860
process as used to make computer chips.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.520
So another advantage of compliant

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.250
mechanisms is that they can be made with
significantly smaller proportions

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.180
because they take advantage of
production processes like photo-lithography

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.880
And we have motion that we
want at the microscopic level -that's brilliant.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.000
Plus since they simplify design
compliant mechanisms are much more

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.700
portable meaning lightweight which makes
them perfect for space applications.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:46.900
This here is something we did with NASA
making a hinge that could replace

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:52.630
bearings for say deploying solar panels.
This is titanium, 3d printed titanium but

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:58.240
what's freaky about it is you get that motion
which people expect but there's a

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.400
piece of titanium that can bend plus
minus 90 degrees, 180 degree deflection

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.200
that is solid titanium. -
That is one piece of titanium that is 3d printed

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:19.620
There's no alloy, nothing to make it flexible. 
-yep, this is yeah and even freakier than this

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:29.200
is this guy right there. So that looks
like a crazy beast but every part in

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.150
there has a purpose. All these flexible
beams

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:39.360
here are the two inputs and again we did
this with NASA for a thruster application

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.250
where you can put a thruster right there
and now with our two motor inputs we can

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:49.710
direct that thruster in any direction.
That titanium device moves that, you

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:54.810
notice that's just all bending and then
there's no pinch points for the fuel

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:58.200
lines or electrical lines coming in.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.500
Here, this single piece of titanium allows you

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.600
to use one thruster in place of two.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.980
Okay, that is a clutch, so the idea is if you

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:14.700
spin it up really fast because it's
flexible this outer part will actually

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.589
start coming outwards and then if
there's a drum around it it'll it'll

00:09:19.589 --> 00:09:25.080
contact with that drum and spin that thing 
-oh so this like kind of oh that

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:30.029
kind of comes out like so 
-when it gets spinning really fast and then you're you essentially

00:09:30.029 --> 00:09:34.380
engage this this outer drum so this is
like the way that a chainsaw would work

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.470
or something like that because you get
it spinning fast enough and then it

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.800
engages the chain and then it turns it
over

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.510
-centrifugal force
-yeah wow that's cool so

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:46.890
So here this is made in plastic so that it
you know you can see it but in reality

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.920
it's gotta be a lot stiffer so here it is made in steel
-What?

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.380
So hang on, you're saying

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:56.300
that that thing, which is made of steel
yup

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.640
You spin it up to a certain speed

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.520
and then it expands and engages a drum that is around it

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.700
-yep so idle with no

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:10.140
motion but then at a certain speed that
are what we designed it for it will

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.780
speed up to that rpm

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.300
You speed it up and it engages
-Yup

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.220
I had no idea like I have

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.480
learned something today

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.160
So let's come back to the safing and

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.020
arming device for nuclear weapons.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.490
Its purpose is to ensure that no random

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:28.140
vibrations say from an earthquake
inadvertently disable safeties and arm

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.020
the nuclear weapon.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.370
Now one of the
requirements was that this device be

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.520
made as small as possible.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.410
They had made those as small as they possibly could

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:41.089
using traditional methods even using things like what the

00:10:41.089 --> 00:10:43.560
Swiss watch manufacturers were using.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.410
With compliant mechanisms they produced

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:49.970
a device out of hardened stainless steel
where some components were the size of a

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.180
human hair.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.779
This is high-speed video, here the device

00:10:53.779 --> 00:10:58.160
is operating at 72 Hertz meaning this
little hole makes two complete

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.040
revolutions each second.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.869
The way it's
meant to work is an arming laser shines

00:11:02.869 --> 00:11:06.619
on the rotor wheel and when the proper
input is given to the system the wheel

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.280
rotates a notch.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.620
If all the proper inputs
are given then the hole lines up with

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:15.320
the laser beam and crazy things happen
from there.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.140
So it is essential that this

00:11:17.149 --> 00:11:23.509
device's performance is perfectly
predictable even if it sits unused in a

00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:24.960
silo for decades.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.080
So are these now being
used on nuclear weapons?

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.809
You know, it turns out they don't tell us what they
do with their nuclear weapons and so we

00:11:32.809 --> 00:11:36.920
design them, we made prototypes we tested
them and then it goes what they call

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.560
behind the fence.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:42.240
And... where it's all classified and, you know we

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.140
don't know what happened, so...

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:52.220
hey this episode was supported by
viewers like you on patreon and by

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:56.040
SimpliSafe, incredibly effective
reliable home security.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.850
Now I started thinking seriously about home security
one day when there was this police

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:03.300
helicopter circling overhead and it
turned out that the house across the

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.000
street had been broken into.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.290
SimpliSafe makes it easy to protect

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.420
your home.
they sent me a kit including a base

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:16.769
station, camera and multiple sensors and
the setup was simple it only took me

00:12:16.769 --> 00:12:18.460
about an hour to complete.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.510
The system is
monitored by professionals 24/7 and they

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.480
can call you or send police in the event
of a break-in.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.900
So it's easy and intuitive to use.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.550
There's also these thoughtful
features that are built-in for example

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.240
it reminds you if you left the door open.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.050
Pricing is fair and honest with no

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:38.399
contracts or hidden fees and it's
equipped for worst-case scenarios like

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.180
if the Wi-Fi goes down or the power is
out it still works.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:42.930
