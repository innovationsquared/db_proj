00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.780
From the top of this forty-five meter drop tower, my friends from the "How Ridiculous" YouTube channel

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.960
are about to release a watermelon.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:07.860
Here we are.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.080
In free fall for a full three seconds, the watermelon accelerates to over 100 kilometers per hour

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.960
before smashing into the ground.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.840
The results are predictable, but this was just a control for the actual experiment.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.640
Another watermelon was sprayed with the polymer coating.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.140
Se'll come back to what this is and how it works,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.200
but for now, let's see how the coated watermelon fares in the drop test.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.580
That's insane!

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.840
[ laughing ]

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.900
Instead of shattering, the watermelon bounces

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.840
and remains intact.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.860
For the most part, anyway.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.720
It's a definitly slushy.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.260
Even with an axe, the "How Ridiculous" boys can't crack this shell.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.880
How did it not?

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.100
AHH!

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.240
[ laughter ]

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.640
AAH YES

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.940
Look it's actually!

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.560
Look at that!

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.800
[ laughter ]

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.200
That is amazing!

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.220
It is pretty amazing that the watermelon could survive an impact of over 100km per hour!

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.700
So I went to find out more about the coating, called Line-X

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.740
It's a mess!

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.020
The individual components are a mess, when it goes on it goes on as a big mess

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.740
you saw me wear a spray suit.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.200
It's a mess! And when you're done, you get some really cool stuff.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.140
Line-X is made from two ingredients, A, and B.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.980
Inside of each of these is multiple things.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:17.120
But the main component of A is Diphenylmethane-4,4'-diisocyanate, or MDI for short.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.580
It's very reactive due to these groups on the end.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.940
B is the poly. The simplest way I could explain it is that it is a plasticizer.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:34.160
The main component of B is alpha- (2-aminomethylethyl) -omega- (2-aminomethylethoxy) -poly (oxy (methyl-1,- 2- ethanediyl))

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.560
A long name for a long chain... molecule.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.480
In reality it would be many times longer than this.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.920
Now, I managed to convince Brin to let me mix the two ingredients the old fashioned way, with a stirr stick.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.000
That's the A.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.640
I'm going to dump A and B in here and just mix them and see what happens.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.740
-Ready?
-Yup!

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.060
Go for it!

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.240
How quickly should they react?

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.980
They are reacting right now!

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.500
Did you see that?

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.860
That is crazy! You can see there's almost, like... I don't know, smoke or something comming up there?

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.780
It's probably getting quite warm, I guess I could have gotten the thermometer out for you.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.940
Feel the bottom and you tell me.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.240
Yeah, that's very hot. It's like the bottom of a hot cup of coffee.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.700
What's happening here is that the molecules of A and B are reacting to form long chains.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.840
Where they join, they form a urea group so the substance is called a polyurea.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.520
The structure of these chains is responsible for the properties of the coating.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.200
So it's hard because it's made of a tangled mess of molecular threads.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.320
But flexible because these threads can be stretched out and then snap back into place.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.720
Things you learn doing the reaction this way are that it's rapid, only taking seconds to react.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.220
And it's exothermic - a lot of heat is given off as these bonds form.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.720
But this ball of Line-X isn't really useful for much, so how do you mix A and B to form an effective coating?

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.300
Put them under really high pressure,  force them together in a really small space.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.320
High temperature, high pressure, just ram them into each other. That essentially mixes them.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.460
And then they come out the end of the gun.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:27.220
So from the time they're seperate components, they mix, out the gun, hit your target. Fraction of a second.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.000
This is where the magic happens

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.320
Inside here, see?
Pull the trigger, out comes Line-X

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.680
We decided to Line-X a piece of paper to see how strong the coating is

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.780
As you can see it came out as a hot, high pressure liquid.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.500
-Ok, now..
-How hot is that?

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.200
It's quite warm, and because that's an exothermic reaction it comes out at 150...

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.660
But it keeps getting hotter and hotter.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.520
You can probably rip it right now.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.860
There you go, Ok.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.520
Those two chemicals just keep kinda looking for each other, or looking for something, so to speak.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.360
Until every last molecule has found a home or given up looking. That could take a day or more.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.040
But there's plenty of opportunities to cross link right now.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.540
So that's what it's doing. And that's where all the heat is coming from

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.380
It's already dry, I'm not going to get any on me.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.680
It's already cooling back down. So we've done the vast majority of curing and cross linking...

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.880
We're getting there right?

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.200
Yeah, it was harder.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.520
Now, we wait until some of this heat goes away.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.560
We're probably getting a good amount of curing going on.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.660
It is really tough to rip at this point

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.560
It's strong stuff

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.480
That tensile strength will get you!

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.660
That high tensile strength is the same reason the Line-X coated watermelon bounces

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.720
As it hits the ground the contents of the watermelon are squeezed out sideways.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.920
But the tangle of polyurea molecules pull together.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.080
Preventing the rind of the watermelon from deforming too much and breaking apart.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.240
So the watermelon bounces instead of smashing.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.060
This type of coating is now used in the walls of the Pentagon.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.500
Preventing exterior explosions from launching shrapnel into the building.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.860
The main cause of injury from explosions.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:39.660
And it's used in bullet proof vests to contain bullet fragments that could cause serious injury.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.160
All of this is pretty incredible for a substance invented as a truck bed liner.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.760
Yeah, come on down! Bring your entire vehicle. Anything but your cat. We'll Line-X it.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.340
Massive thanks to the guys over at the "How Ridiculous" YouTube Channel!

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.540
You know, they are the ones that launched that basketball off the dam.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.280
That is my most popular video.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.900
And they have been doing some incredible experiments, like "Bowling Ball vs Axe".

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.720
