00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.280
We have all heard of mind over matter, but
is it possible that the right motivation can

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.760
actually help repair spinal damage?I have
come to Lausanne, Switzerland to find out

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.289
about some innovative research being done
to repair the spinal cords of rats using pharmaceuticals,

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.289
electrical signals.

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.579
And the key ingredient?

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:21.489
Motivation.

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:28.259
Sometimes with the right motivation anything
is possible.

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:36.570
Tres bien.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.120
The main function of the spinal cord is to
transmit neural signals or messages between

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.460
the brain and the rest of the body.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.260
So when the spinal cord is severed or crushed,
these messages can’t get past the injury.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.370
The result is often chronic paralysis.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.220
Research in this area generally focuses on
regenerating damaged nerve fibers, but here

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.430
in Lausanne they are taking a different approach.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.430
&gt;&gt; Bonjour, Derek.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.430
&gt;&gt; Bonjour.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.430
&gt;&gt; Welcome in the lab.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.440
&gt;&gt; Ah, thank you.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.239
&gt;&gt; Professor Courtine’s work with rats is
producing remarkable results.

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:13.549
&gt;&gt; So I thought, what can we actually deliver
to the spinal cord the kind of information

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.200
that the brain would deliver naturally in
order to walk.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.399
&gt;&gt; The rats have their spinal cord’s cut
in two places.

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:27.760
Although not completely severed, signals can’t
get past the legion, leaving the rats paralyzed.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.390
To reactivate the healthy, but disconnected
neural cells below the injury, the researchers

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.309
administer a cocktail of synthetic neural
transmitters followed by electrical stimulation.

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:44.779
&gt;&gt; I am cutting the cable that connects to
the electrodes on the spinal cord so we can

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:47.219
provide the stimulation to the spinal cord.

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:48.219
&gt;&gt; Ok.

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.500
So there are cables that run down the spinal
cord?

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.039
&gt;&gt; It actually runs under the skin and then
it is sutured on top of the spinal cord.

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.170
&gt;&gt; This electro-chemical combination mimics
the input of the brain and reawakens the spinal

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.280
cord below the lesion.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.170
&gt;&gt; Now I start the 20 immediately.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.920
Oh, as soon as that is working.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.489
It is amazing, right?

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:10.489
&gt;&gt; The result?

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.590
After a few weeks of training and while on
the treadmill, the rat is incredibly able

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.590
to walk again.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.950
&gt;&gt; So this animal was completely paralyzed
five minutes ago and now she is doing {?} stepping

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.310
on the treadmill.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.970
And now we have got 20 speed.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.790
Even got the... the animal is capable of {?} on
the treadmill.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.530
And look at this.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.570
You can let him do it yourself.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.990
I would stop the treadmill.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.730
Oh, she stands immediately.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.950
&gt;&gt; But this is happening without the involvement
of the brain.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.440
At this stage the rat’s stepping is stimulated
by the treadmill.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.650
The legs are moving independently of the brain,
so the movement is completely involuntary.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.400
&gt;&gt; You can train rats on this treadmill for
two months.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.100
You will not see recovery of voluntary control.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.100
Why?

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.100
The brain is not involved.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.120
There is no motivation to work, because we
see that the rat...

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.950
&gt;&gt; Motivation is the key to restoring voluntary
movement.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.250
So this is when the irresistible Swiss chocolate
comes in.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:14.030
I brought a chocolate éclair . I ate half,
but the other half is for the rat.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.730
&gt;&gt; Yes, eat.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:16.730
&gt;&gt; she does like it.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.200
&gt;&gt; She likes it.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.400
&gt;&gt; We have a combination of like actually
yogurt and chocolate which the rat love.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.349
&gt;&gt; This reward based training without a treadmill
was the focus of the next phase of research.

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.060
&gt;&gt; I have to get her in the right position.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.120
&gt;&gt; They designed a special robot which only
supports the paralyzed rat, but doesn’t

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.120
propel it forward.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.530
&gt;&gt; This means that the rats really need to
generate the propulsive forces to go to the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.510
reward, which is the chocolate.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.100
&gt;&gt; So the rat is asked to go and to push herself
forward.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.740
But she does get a little bit of help up and
down.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.290
&gt;&gt; So the rats have, again, been given electric
chemical stimulants, but without the treadmill

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.040
the rat has to decide for itself if it wants
to walk.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.170
&gt;&gt; When you want the animal to participate
very actively, I mean, we are talking about

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.430
the championships of rehabilitation, you know?

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.540
You need to motivate the rat at any cost.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.049
&gt;&gt; Come, come, come, come, come.

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.180
&gt;&gt; So Rubia does whatever it takes to coax
the rat to walk.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.460
&gt;&gt; Come on, jump, go forwards.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.460
Come on.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.460
Push, then push.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.460
Push it.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.460
Push and come on.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.460
&gt;&gt; Go, go, go, go, go, go.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.460
&gt;&gt; Come on.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.460
Keep going.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.160
&gt;&gt; The rat is now walking when it wants to,
which means the brain’s signals are getting

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.740
through to the previously paralyzed limbs.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.100
&gt;&gt; Wow, she has done really well.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.790
&gt;&gt; The rat’s spinal cord seems much more
capable of rewiring itself than anyone expected.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.700
In one of the most extensive examples observed,
it has been able to detour around the injury

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.600
and reconnect the dormant neural network.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:58.330
&gt;&gt; What we observe is that the cut fibers,
basically, they grow and deliver to this {?} injury

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.790
enough information.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:06.270
We don’t know what kind, but sufficient
information from the brain to have voluntary

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.610
control.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.790
&gt;&gt; What we are hearing is evidence of the
rat making the decision to walk.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.389
The popping sound is a neuron firing.

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:17.600
And here she is just standing, but you will
see once she starts walking there is a pretty

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.910
clear pattern of the activity of the neuron
with the rat stepping.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.210
&gt;&gt; It is showing that the movement is voluntary.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.370
&gt;&gt; That is really cool.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.890
That was really exciting the first time that
happened, because, you know, we had this idea

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.610
that the brain should be involved, but it
hadn't been proven.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:36.610
&gt;&gt; Go, go, go.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.840
&gt;&gt; There is a whole team of people working
and everybody is pushing the rat and everybody

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.530
is all go, go, go.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.930
And I could hear it before it happened.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.430
And I really knew, ok, it is going to work
this time.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.430
&gt;&gt; Perfect.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.430
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.190
With half of all human spinal injuries leading
to chronic paralysis, Professor Courtine’s

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.270
research gives new hope to those affected.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:02.480
&gt;&gt; So, of course, the next obvious and, you
know, exciting goal is to try this type of

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.790
intervention in humans.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.810
I don’t know, it is difficult to say what
this will achieve in humans.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:33.150
But, you know, it is a very promising new
path.
