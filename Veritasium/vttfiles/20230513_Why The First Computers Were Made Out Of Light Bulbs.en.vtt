00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.070
- [Derek] The modern era of electronics

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.970
began with the light bulb

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.963
but not in the way you might think.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.290
Early light bulbs consisted
of a carbon filament

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.851
sealed inside a glass bulb

00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:14.040
with a vacuum inside.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.830
When a potential difference was
applied across the filament,

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.510
current flowed through it,

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.210
heating it up to over 2000 Kelvin,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.430
so hot that it glowed.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.620
If there had been much oxygen in the bulb,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.140
the filament would've burned immediately.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.630
That was the reason for the vacuum.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.790
But from the perspective of electronics,

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.580
the real breakthrough came
from a curious observation

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.413
made by Thomas Edison.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.512
He saw that over a bulb's lifetime,

00:00:40.512 --> 00:00:43.200
the glass became discolored,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.600
turning yellow, and then brown,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.360
but only on one side.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.283
So what was going on?

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.840
Well, the heated filament
emits not only light and heat

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.000
but also electrons.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.524
You can think of them being
boiled off the surface

00:00:59.524 --> 00:01:01.290
of the carbon.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.020
This phenomenon, known
as thermionic emission,

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.090
had twice been discovered independently

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.390
by other scientists up
to 27 years earlier.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.020
But after Edison, it became widely known.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.070
In fact, for a time,

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.290
the emission of electrons
off a hot filament

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.990
was called the Edison effect.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.923
Now, these electrons floating
around were unobstructed

00:01:21.923 --> 00:01:24.210
because they're in a vacuum.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.950
But since there was a potential difference

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.990
across the wires that led to the filament,

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.380
the electrons were attracted
to the positive wire.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.690
So they accelerated towards it

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.773
and most would whizz straight past it

00:01:35.773 --> 00:01:38.010
and crash into the glass,

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.810
over time discoloring it
only on the positive side.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.258
I should note that Edison
was using DC electricity.

00:01:45.258 --> 00:01:47.460
If he had been using AC,

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.580
then both sides would've been discolored.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.040
But it was this observation
that set the scene

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.810
for an electronics revolution,

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.173
and eventually the
first digital computers.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.768
In 1904, John Ambrose
Fleming patented a device

00:02:02.768 --> 00:02:05.700
that was very similar
to Edison's light bulb,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.220
but with one important addition:

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.980
a second electrode in the bulb.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.661
By charging this plate positively

00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:14.310
with respect to the filament,

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.890
electrons could be
accelerated across the gap,

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.600
completing the circuit.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.430
But if the plate were slightly negative

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.660
relative to the filament,

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.220
then it would repel electrons

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.380
and no current would flow.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.460
Fleming called his device a
one-way street for electricity.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.920
Since only one of the
electrodes was heated,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.770
electrons could only flow
from there to the plate

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.110
and not the other way around.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.840
The device was called a thermionic diode

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.320
and it was used initially
for detecting radio signals

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.700
but it could also convert

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.223
alternating current to direct current.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.180
Scientists quickly realized
that a more efficient design

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.502
had the filament in the center

00:02:52.502 --> 00:02:54.962
and the other electrode
to the plate or anode

00:02:54.962 --> 00:02:57.480
as a cylinder surrounding it.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.713
This geometry captured
more of the electrons

00:02:59.713 --> 00:03:01.140
coming off the filament

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.693
and allowed for larger currents to flow.

00:03:06.684 --> 00:03:09.270
-  Oh, there she goes.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.890
- [Derek] With just one of these diodes,

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.240
you could convert AC
into a bumpy kind of DC.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.260
But combining a few diodes and a capacitor

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.030
led to a fairly steady direct current,

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.590
and this was a big deal.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.440
It was the first practical
vacuum tube device

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.660
and the model for all vacuum tubes

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.890
that would dominate the industry

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.453
for the next half century.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.740
In the early 1900s,

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.890
the big problem in
electronics was amplification.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.690
Radio had just been invented

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.100
but its range was limited

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.840
by the lack of reliable equipment

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.940
that could boost weak signals.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.040
Similarly, telephone calls were limited

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.680
to at most 1300 kilometers

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.850
because by that point,

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.544
the signal was two faint to hear.

00:03:53.544 --> 00:03:55.941
Rudimentary form of
amplification had been built

00:03:55.941 --> 00:03:59.400
for telegraph operation called the relay.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.980
In a relay, there is an electromagnet.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.380
And when current flows
through that electromagnet,

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.180
it attracts a switch,

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.340
turning on a second circuit.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.470
But when the current through
the electromagnet stops,

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.820
the switch is released

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.400
and the second circuit is open again.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.350
This device works well for amplifying

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.710
the dots and dashes of Morse
code along a telegraph line

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.930
but its binary output means it's incapable

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.983
of amplifying the complex
and analog signals

00:04:24.983 --> 00:04:27.573
of phone calls and radio waves.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.530
And that's why it was such
a breakthrough in 1906

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.720
when Lee de Forest took the diode

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.750
and added another electrode into the bulb.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.630
This electrode wasn't
a solid piece of metal

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.240
but rather a sparse wire mesh

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.660
and it was positioned in
between the filament or cathode

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.280
and the anode.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.910
With three electrodes,
it was called a triode.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.250
Now, a large potential
difference could be applied

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.380
across the anode and cathode

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.520
but the number of electrons

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.560
that actually flowed between them

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.350
was controlled by the voltage on the grid,

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.600
as this new electrode was known.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.760
If the grid were slightly
negatively charged,

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.890
it repelled electrons from the filament

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.290
so that none could flow
through to the anode.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.300
But if the grid were slightly positive,

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.480
then electrons were attracted
away from the filament

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.030
and most of them would pass
through the holes in the grid,

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.580
and then accelerate to the anode.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.300
So in this way, a small
change in voltage on the grid

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.540
can control a huge voltage at the anode

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.040
and the response is rapid.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.520
So you can get high
frequency amplification.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.630
I like to think of it

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.180
as standing at the top of a high cliff,

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.630
opening and closing a
valve on a big water pipe.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.690
I mean, it doesn't take much
energy to turn the valve

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.542
but that small input is converted

00:05:44.542 --> 00:05:49.113
into a huge output of water
falling down the cliff.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.299
- [Derek] You're powering
up this track here.

00:05:52.299 --> 00:05:54.510
- [David] Warming up, you
can see it warming up there.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.062
- [Derek] So the yellow is the input?

00:05:56.062 --> 00:05:57.360
- [David] Yellow is the input.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.620
Purple is the output.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.247
We have essentially a two-volt change

00:06:00.247 --> 00:06:02.250
on the input giving us, what is this?

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.360
Five volts, so five, 10,
15-volt change on the output.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.680
- [Derek] For this demonstration,

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.290
we were only using 24 volts on the anode.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.820
If we had used a higher voltage,

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.520
we could have got a lot more amplification

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.650
and people did.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.660
This was the device that allowed us

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.390
to call long distance for the first time.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.440
Using vacuum tubes,

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.972
the first transcontinental call

00:06:23.972 --> 00:06:25.830
from New York to San Francisco

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.433
took place on the 25th of January, 1915.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.000
- [Derek] Whoa.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.290
- [David] Yeah, there we go,

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.090
should be 10 volts.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.736
- [Derek] It's hard to see the grid here

00:06:37.736 --> 00:06:40.980
because just like with
the cylindrical diode,

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.488
the best configuration for a triode

00:06:42.488 --> 00:06:45.120
is to have a cylindrical configuration.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.378
The anode is on the outside,

00:06:46.378 --> 00:06:48.361
the grid is cylindrically inside that,

00:06:48.361 --> 00:06:51.483
and the cathode or
filament is in the center.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.140
The invention of the triode
was incredibly important.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.830
Radios, TVs, whatever
electronics people had

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.810
were powered by vacuum tubes.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.730
You would've had so many in your house

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.760
even up until the 1960s and '70s.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.303
But vacuum tubes weren't done
revolutionizing electronics.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.630
In his 1937 thesis,

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.810
Claude Shannon found a connection
between electric circuits

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.410
and a branch of mathematics
known as Boolean algebra.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.390
Working in the mid-1800s,

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.340
George Boole was trying to find

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.710
a mathematical foundation for logic.

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:26.730
Under his system,

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.320
a true statement was represented

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.380
as a 1 and a false statement as a 0.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.340
And Boole also developed
a few operations like AND.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.423
If both statements A and B were true,

00:07:37.423 --> 00:07:40.143
then the output would also be true.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.920
What Shannon realized is
that Boole's operations

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.620
could be represented
as electronic circuits,

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.090
that there was an equivalence

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.190
between mathematical statements

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.990
and electric circuits.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.110
All you needed to realize these
circuits in the real world

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.823
were a couple switches.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.820
That same year, 1937,

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.910
George Stibitz built the
first digital calculator.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:06.330
It could add two 1-bit binary numbers.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.250
That is it could add two numbers

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.070
so long as they were either 0 or 1.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.500
The calculator worked using a relay,

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.500
that electromechanical
switch from telegraphy.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.880
There were two inputs.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.520
If they were left open, the input was 0.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.770
If closed, it was a 1.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.283
The output was shown with two light bulbs.

00:08:25.283 --> 00:08:26.970
If no lights were on,

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.260
the answer was 0.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.730
If the output light was on,

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:30.810
the answer was 1.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.100
And if the carry light was on,

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.630
the answer was a 2.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.690
The circuit diagram works like this.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.420
If neither switch A or B is closed,

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.250
so adding 0 + 0,

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.440
then no current flows through the circuit

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.600
and no light bulb would light up.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.550
But if input A was closed,

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.200
the current would flow
through the solenoid,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.820
creating a magnetic field

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.460
that pulls the switch inside it closed,

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.845
and this connects the
output light bulb to power

00:08:55.845 --> 00:08:58.020
and disconnects the carry light bulb.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.510
So the output light bulb lights up,

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.430
meaning that the answer is 1.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:03.540
And the same thing would happen

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:07.050
when input B was closed and A was open.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.609
But if you closed both
A and B simultaneously,

00:09:09.609 --> 00:09:13.110
then there is no current
flowing through the solenoid

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.970
but there would be a current flowing

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:16.248
from the battery connected to A,

00:09:16.248 --> 00:09:18.720
which is connected to
the carry light bulb.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.070
So it lights up indicating 1 + 1 equals 2.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.239
This is the beginning of the digital age,

00:09:25.239 --> 00:09:27.630
and no it was not glamorous.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.539
Stibitz built his device
out of a few batteries,

00:09:30.539 --> 00:09:33.630
light bulbs, and relays
he had lying around.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.050
And for the inputs, he
cut up a tin of tobacco.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.450
He built it in one night
at his kitchen table

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.720
which is why it became
known as the Model K.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.160
The circuit that Stibitz built

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.560
is now called a half adder.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.910
But if you look at the circuit

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.650
through the eyes of Claude Shannon,

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:53.280
you realize it's actually
a pair of logic gates.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.290
The output light bulb should turn on

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:59.460
when either A or B, but
not both, are closed,

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.850
so this is known as an exclusive OR gate.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.890
Whereas the carry light
bulb should only turn on

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.034
when both A and B are closed,

00:10:07.034 --> 00:10:10.140
so this is an AND gate.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.300
This circuit uses electrical versions

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.570
of Boolean operators, XOR and AND.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.790
And it's possible to build
other Boolean operators

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:18.742
as electronic gates

00:10:18.742 --> 00:10:22.470
for things like OR, NOR, and NAND.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.930
And you might say, what's the big deal?

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.640
I mean, the big deal is
that you just tricked

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.160
a bunch of electrons
into doing math for you.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.927
Sure, it's very simple math,

00:10:30.927 --> 00:10:33.570
but you could connect a bunch
of these half adders together

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:35.526
and build more and more
complicated circuits

00:10:35.526 --> 00:10:38.340
that could do more complex math,

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.080
which is exactly what Stibitz

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.270
and his colleagues at Bell Labs did.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.550
Two years later, they built the model I,

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.680
which had more than 400 relays

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.960
and could add two eight
digit numbers together

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.490
in a 10th of a second.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.590
It could also multiply eight digit numbers

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.870
and do multiplication of complex numbers,

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.420
though these more complicated
operations took longer,

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.550
about a minute per calculation.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.909
- So you put a voltage through a coil

00:11:01.909 --> 00:11:04.470
and it'll turn that switch on or off.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.963
So you've got your two operands here.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.960
And if you wanna add two numbers together,

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.130
so 2 is this,

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:12.783
3 is this, right?

00:11:12.783 --> 00:11:16.290
So 1, 0 is 2.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.123
- [Derek] Yeah.

00:11:17.123 --> 00:11:19.470
- [David] And 1, 1 is 3.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.270
And so then when you want to calculate it,

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.120
you just hit the go button down here.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.100
We get 101.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.140
- [Derek] I love the sound of that.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.010
That is amazing.

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.293
- It's magical, so if
you wanna do like say,

00:11:32.157 --> 00:11:35.370
8 plus, that would be 4

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:37.439
so 8 + 8, I think, right?

00:11:37.439 --> 00:11:38.272
- [Derek] Okay.

00:11:38.272 --> 00:11:39.105
- [David] Yeah, 8 + 8,

00:11:39.105 --> 00:11:41.190
that would be, 16, no,
it clears it on its own.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:42.450
- [Derek] Okay.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.430
- [David] There you go.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.419
Eight plus eight is 16 in binary,

00:11:46.419 --> 00:11:49.713
which would be 1 0 0 0 0.

00:11:50.576 --> 00:11:52.350
(machine clacking)

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.990
This is essentially a
1-bit arithmetic unit.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:56.250
There's no logic functions.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:57.780
It only ever does add.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.026
Now, let's say we wanna do 5 - 2,

00:12:00.026 --> 00:12:01.560
the answer's gonna be 3.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.850
So we flip this little switch here

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:05.340
that lets me know that I'm
doing a subtraction operation

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.190
and we do subtraction
by doing 2's complement.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.180
So essentially what we're doing

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.580
is we're inverting one of the operands

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.200
and we're adding one.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.181
So now when I run it,

00:12:14.181 --> 00:12:15.720
(machine clacking)

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.209
we can see 5 - 2 is equal to 3,

00:12:18.209 --> 00:12:20.105
so 2 and 1 is 3.

00:12:20.105 --> 00:12:22.210
Now, because of the way that we do this,

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.468
the final carry flag

00:12:23.468 --> 00:12:25.560
ends up getting illuminated
here on the end.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.650
But if we know that we're
doing a subtraction operation,

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.030
we know that this final carry flag

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.940
is never going to be on otherwise.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.050
- [Derek] Over the next 10 years,

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.630
they built six more
computers based on relays

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.520
which were used by the US military

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.080
and the National Advisory Committee

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.660
for Astronautics or NACA,

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.970
which later would become NASA.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:46.514
But even by the early 1940s,

00:12:46.514 --> 00:12:49.500
it was clear that the
mechanical nature of the relay,

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.260
the physical closing and
opening of the switches,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.140
was too slow to be the future of computers

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.030
and they were also prone to breaking.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.650
- Anytime you have
something that's mechanical,

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.030
it's gonna wear down.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.040
Every time that relay switches,

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.270
there's a little bit of friction

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.550
on the rotation point inside of there

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.260
and there's contacts

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.390
that are making and breaking
electrical connections,

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.590
and those are gonna wear out.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.690
- [Derek] And all the
relays opening and closing

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.678
meant that the computers
were incredibly loud.

00:13:15.678 --> 00:13:18.960
(machine clacking)

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.820
- So it doesn't really work

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.500
in a business environment all that well.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.552
You can't really stuff it into your office

00:13:24.552 --> 00:13:26.452
that you're gonna drive people insane.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.180
- [Derek] So what computer
scientists really needed

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.070
was an electronic switch

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.253
and that is where the
vacuum tube triode comes in.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.983
Whoa!

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.931
I mean, sure it can work as an amplifier

00:13:40.931 --> 00:13:42.448
if you put slightly positive

00:13:42.448 --> 00:13:44.850
or negative voltages on the grid,

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.520
but it can also work as a switch.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.920
If the grid voltage is very negative,

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.480
then no current flows.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.880
And if the grid voltage is very positive,

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.040
then maximum current flows.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.140
So a triode can be controlled

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.360
using no moving parts.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.160
Just a voltage will set it

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.680
to be either a 0 or a 1.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.540
And best of all, switching between the two

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.450
can be done rapidly with no noise

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:10.938
since you're just controlling electrons

00:14:10.938 --> 00:14:13.500
zipping around in a vacuum.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.683
This is the invention that took
computing to the next level.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.430
The world's first electronic
programmable computer

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:21.690
was called ENIAC

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:23.310
and it came online for the first time

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.830
on December 10th, 1945.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:29.340
It took up a whole room, weighed 30 tons,

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:33.000
and used 175 kilowatts of power.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.579
So much that it led to a rumor

00:14:34.579 --> 00:14:35.997
that every time it turned on,

00:14:35.997 --> 00:14:37.306
the lights in Philadelphia,

00:14:37.306 --> 00:14:40.503
where ENIAC was located, would dim.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:43.230
Now, that was just a rumor,

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.820
but mainly because ENIAC

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.604
had its own dedicated electrical generator

00:14:46.604 --> 00:14:50.220
to keep up with the enormous power draw.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.720
Unlike previous computers,

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.680
ENIAC wasn't limited

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.740
to just solving one type
of mathematical problem.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.440
It could be programmed and it was fast,

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.860
completing 500 operations per second.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.480
At the time, the word computers

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.545
still referred to people

00:15:04.545 --> 00:15:07.470
doing calculations with pen and paper.

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:11.970
So 500 operations per
second was really fast.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.890
ENIAC's flexibility and power

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:15.180
was immediately useful

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.430
for the development of the hydrogen bomb.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:19.710
The computations needed were so complex

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.510
that the director of
Los Alamos at the time

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.280
said that, "It would've been impossible

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.930
to arrive at any solution

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.390
without the aid of ENIAC."

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:30.154
- This is a hilarious part
bout having a processor

00:15:30.154 --> 00:15:33.180
that is 1 meter tall
and 70 centimeters wide,

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:36.330
is that you can point at
actual parts of the processor.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:37.740
- [Derek] This is what a 1-bit

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.843
vacuum tube computer looks like.

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.060
- [David] Can you feel
the heat coming off of it?

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:46.140
- [Derek] I certainly can.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.970
- [David] I can feel the heat coming off.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:49.080
- [Derek] It's getting warm.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.870
- Well, I mean, 190 vacuum tubes is a lot.

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:53.040
I think we figured it out.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.520
This is pulling like 350
or 400 watts of power

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.854
or something like that,

00:15:57.854 --> 00:15:59.910
which is absurd.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.100
At night, it's awesome.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.143
It looks like a city.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.590
- [Derek] But there were also major flaws

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:08.850
with vacuum tubes.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.830
The filaments always needed to be heated,

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:14.070
so they used a lot of
power even when idle,

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:15.450
and they were big.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.000
It was hard to make a glass vacuum tube

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.900
with complex electrodes
inside arbitrarily small.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.790
They were also unreliable.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.212
On average, a vacuum tube in ENIAC

00:16:25.212 --> 00:16:27.510
broke down every few days.

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:30.900
And then, it needed to
be found and replaced.

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.255
The longest that ENIAC
operated for without failure

00:16:33.255 --> 00:16:36.690
was just 116 hours.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:41.640
The first digital computers
ran on glorified light bulbs.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.600
That is why they were so big,
power-hungry, and unreliable.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.810
The miracle and what has made
our modern lives possible

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.130
is that someone figured out

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:53.070
how to perform the same
trick with electrons

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:57.990
inside a solid piece of
material, in silicon.

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:00.363
But that's a story for another day.

00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:08.880
If you wanna learn about
how modern computing devices

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.380
store and access information,

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.880
I highly recommend you check out

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.340
this video's sponsor brilliant.org.

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:15.660
They have courses on everything

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.220
from computer science fundamentals

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.920
to neural networks to quantum computing.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.270
Their latest interactive course

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.520
is called How Technology Works.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.590
It includes a lesson on computer memory

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:27.390
where you can get hands-on with the kinds

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:30.840
of computational logic gates
we discussed in this video.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.230
It also has a lesson that
delves into the ingenious ways

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:36.630
video compression makes
modern day streaming possible,

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:39.210
so you can watch videos like this one.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.460
Ever wondered how your
phone knows where you are?

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.410
There's a lesson on that too.

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.570
There's even a lesson on password theft

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.670
where you can walk in
the footsteps of a hacker

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.820
to discover why some passwords
are stronger than others.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.380
You can try all these out for free

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.590
by going to brilliant.org/veritasium.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.300
You know, whether it's
getting a working knowledge

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.180
of modern day technology
or building skills in math,

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.100
computer science or data science,

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.230

bite-sized interactive lessons

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:08.466
that not only help master key concepts

00:18:08.466 --> 00:18:11.730
but connect what you learn
to real-world examples.

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:13.830
And because each lesson is hands-on,

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.510
you'll build real intuition

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.880
so you can put what you've learned to use.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.650
Now, as we've seen, the
development of technology

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:21.802
is an ongoing process
that constantly reshapes

00:18:21.802 --> 00:18:24.480
the way we interact with
the world around us.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.220
Today, it's more important than ever

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.200
to keep up with these changes.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.051
Who knows what revolutionary
technology will emerge next?

00:18:31.051 --> 00:18:33.330
But whatever it is, you can rest assured

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.610
that you'll be able to
learn about it on Brilliant.
