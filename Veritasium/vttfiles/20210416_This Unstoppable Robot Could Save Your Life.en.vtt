00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.992
- This is a robot that can grow

00:00:01.992 --> 00:00:04.930
to hundreds of times its size,

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.050
and it can't be stopped
by adhesives or spikes.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.460
Although it looks kind
of simple and cheap,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.850
it has dozens of potential applications,

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.350
including, one day maybe saving your life.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.090
This video is sponsored by Morning Brew,

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.073
the free daily newsletter.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.340
Now I made a video before
about a soft truss robot.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.840
And this is also a soft robot,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.700
but very different in how
it works and what it can do.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.500
These robots can be made
out of almost any material,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.200
but they all follow the
same basic principle.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.618
Powered by compressed air,
they grow from the tip.

00:00:42.618 --> 00:00:43.710
(air hissing)
(object rustling)

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.126
- That's good.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.170
- And this allows the robot
to pass through tight spaces,

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.350
and also over sticky surfaces.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.215
- Something like a car
will get stuck to it.

00:00:56.215 --> 00:00:58.665
(car winding)

00:00:59.568 --> 00:01:00.730
It gets stuck in the wheels.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.407
Now, if I do the same
thing with the vine robot,

00:01:02.407 --> 00:01:04.550
see the robot is able to extend...

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.700
- It can navigate this
curvy and twisted passageway

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.810
effortlessly,

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.610
which suggests some of the applications

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.330
it's well-suited for.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.160
Now you might think spikes
would be the downfall

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.930
of an inflatable robot,

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.030
but even if it's punctured,

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.380
as long as you have
sufficient air pressure,

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.410
the robot keeps going.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.752
- And you might be able to hear it.

00:01:24.752 --> 00:01:26.170
(air hissing)
It's actually leaking now,

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.194
so I'll have to turn up the pressure.

00:01:28.194 --> 00:01:31.090
(object rustling)
(air hissing)

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.800
This by itself is not yet a robot,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.750
but once we add steering,
a camera, some sensors,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.940
and maybe some intelligence as
to where we're directing it,

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.090
then we could say it's a robot.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.300
So this is sort of the
backbone of our robot.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.740
This is what allows us to
build our type of robots.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.570
- So where did the idea
for this device come from?

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.830
- I had a vine in my
office that was on a shelf,

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.960
and it was kind of out of the sunlight.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.680
And over the course of like a year or so,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.430
it slowly grew out this tender roll

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.830
out and around the edge of the shelf

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.360
and towards the sunlight.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.490
I said, "That's a pretty cool
thing it just did," right?

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.707
So I started thinking,

00:02:06.707 --> 00:02:09.120
"Well is there a way you
can do that robotically?"

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.520
- The solution is really
elegant in its simplicity.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.430
Just take some airtight tubing
and fold it in on itself.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.360
It's kind of like a water wiggle,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.662
those toys that are really hard to hold.

00:02:21.662 --> 00:02:22.610
(air hissing)
When you inflate it

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.160
with compressed air, it starts
growing out from the tip.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.150
And if you want the tube to
always bend at a certain spot,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.460
you could just tape the
tubing on the outside

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.770
to shorten one of the sides.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.310
For example, you could tape
it into a helical shape

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.743
to create a deployable antenna.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.540
What about getting them to retract?

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.670
- Yeah, that's a challenging problem.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.990
When you're in a constrained environment,

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.660
all you really have to do

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.930
is pull on, we call it the tail,

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.690
so the material that is passing

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.120
through the core of the body,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.810
you pull on it and it basically ungrows,

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.450
it just goes back inside itself.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.730
Now, if you're in a big
open area like this,

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.400
and you try pulling on that,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.360
instead of inverting, so retracting,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.000
it tends to kind of coil
up and make a ugly shape.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.410
- And the engineers have come up with ways

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.560
to retract the tube to
prevent it from buckling

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.150
using internal rollers.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.550
But the two doesn't have
to be the same diameter

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.660
the whole way along,

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.860
here there's actually
a much wider section,

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.690
think of it like a pillow

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.880
that's packed into the end of the robot.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.507
- Yeah, if you could
sit cross-legged on it.

00:03:25.507 --> 00:03:28.030
- Cross-legged on the table.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.600
This sounds (groans) super sketchy.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.970
- So it grows underneath
the table just as usual,

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.515
and then as the pillow
part starts inflating,

00:03:36.515 --> 00:03:38.523
(object clattering)
(man mumbles)

00:03:38.523 --> 00:03:40.800
Is this not good, or is this okay?

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.633
It can actually lift me up.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.305
So my balance is not great as we can see.

00:03:48.305 --> 00:03:50.109
- You're standing on it.

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:51.520
- Stand on it?
- Yeah.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.290
- What's amazing is that this
doesn't require much pressure

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.840
above atmospheric,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.510
just a 10th of an atmosphere

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.710
applied over a large
area like a square meter

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.430
can lift something as
heavy as 1000 kilograms,

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.350
all the while remaining soft.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.549
(object rustling)
Oh.

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.320
Whoa, (sighs) that was great.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.750
That's the paradoxical
thing about pressure.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.910
You can get a large overall
force with low pressure

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.230
as long as the area is large enough.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.350
What sort of area is
that, that pillow there?

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.470
- It's 600 square inches.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.900
All right, so with one
PSI it's 600 pounds.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.170
- Yeah.
- Yeah. (laughs)

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.947
- Two PSI is 1200 pounds.
- That's just crazy.

00:04:28.947 --> 00:04:30.690
And the whole time it feels really soft.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.440
- Yeah, 'cause there's
a couple PSI, right?

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.780
- It's important that
the device is still soft

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.350
so it doesn't hurt anyone.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.860
- So you can design these things

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.530
to have cross-section that
changes along its length.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.970
So it can be a very small body

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.840
that could grow into, for
example, a collapsed building

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.790
and potentially lift a large object

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.090
off someone who's trapped,

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.460
or maybe in a car crash
or something like that.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.640
It can apply huge forces

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.710
with very soft
(air whooshing)

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.800
and lightweight cheap material.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.380
- These robots can also be deployed

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.180
in search and rescue operations

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.760
by attaching sensors like
a camera onto the front.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.690
- These robots are actually
really hard to stop.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.930
So you can take them,
grow them into a clutter,

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.940
potentially a class building
or something like that,

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.010
and they will continue to go somewhere.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.730
And alternative is they're so cheap,

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:18.960
I mean, they're basically free.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.610
You could grow a hundred
of them, let's say,

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.350
into a collapsed building
with some sensing on them,

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.490
and maybe only one of them finds somebody.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.250
I mean, that's a huge success if it does.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.940
- But how do you keep a camera connected

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.340
to the front of the robot when
it grows out from the tip?

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.550
Well, one way is to use an end cap

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.250
which allows that camera
just to stay on the front,

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.150
pushed from behind by the robot,

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.580
but there are other
mechanisms of attachment.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.680
The tiny wireless camera is
mounted on an external frame,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.600
but this frame interlocks
with an internal frame

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.140
which is actually inside
the pressurized part

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.390
of the robot body.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.810
It's similar to how a
roller coaster's wheels

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.910
go around the track.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.150
So this prevents the
camera from falling off

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.850
as the robot grows.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.000
What's really interesting

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.950
is how the vine robot
can be actively steered.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.316
They attach artificial
muscles to the robot.

00:06:11.316 --> 00:06:13.720
(air hissing)

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.440
So the way this muscle works

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.970
is that if you inflate
it, it expands sideways,

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.890
which leads to it contracting in length.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.520
- We don't actually use these much anymore

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.540
because although it's soft,
it's still somewhat stiff.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.290
So what we use instead

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.000
are simply tubes of this
ripstop nylon fabric

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.360
with the braid oriented at 45 degrees.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.193
So in this sense

00:06:34.193 --> 00:06:36.752
we just have one single
layer of airtight fabric.

00:06:36.752 --> 00:06:38.960
(air hissing)

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.890
This is the main robot body here,

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.720
then we have three pneumatic
muscles connected to it.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.990
Now, these three muscles

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.570
are each connected to their own air supply

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.670
connected to regulators over here.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.380
As the robot extends from the tip,

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.840
we can steer it by shortening
and lengthening the sides.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.520
So, you know, just the way your hand works

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.740
is if I shorten this tendon in my arm

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.260
my hand will move this way,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.660
or if I shorten the one on this side

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.700
it'll move the other way.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.440
So our vine robot, we have
these muscles along its side,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.950
so as they inflate
they'll turn it one way,

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.820
then if I deflate the
one on the other side,

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.010
it'll turn the other way.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.810
- So the vine robot can
fit through tight spaces.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.710
It doesn't typically get stuck on anything

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.050
and isn't bothered by sharp objects.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.240
And once you attach that
camera on the front,

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.057
it's ideal for things like archeology.

00:07:21.057 --> 00:07:23.830
(group chattering)
(objects clanking)

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.070
The robot was actually taken to Peru

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.430
to investigate some very narrow shafts.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.330
- So we were looking at
this archeological site

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.570
that was built somewhere
between 1500 and 500 BC

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.670
in the Andes mountains of Peru,

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.260
and it was an ancient temple

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.580
that had all these underground spaces.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.590
And part of what the
archeologists were doing

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.470
was trying to understand
what the spaces were for

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.100
and what the people who built them

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.720
were trying to do with them.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.100
So part of that was unknown,

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.600
but there were these giant rooms
that they called galleries,

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.430
and then there were these
small ducts or tunnels

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.400
that were offshoots of these rooms,

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.470
and they wanted to know
where these ducts led

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.840
but they were too small
for a person to go in.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.430
So we were able to
successfully use the vine robot

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.300
to explore three of the tunnels

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.620
that couldn't have been
seen through other means,

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.720
which was super exciting.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.873
And we got video inside the entire tunnels

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:21.113
and gave it to the archeology team.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:22.963
- There's an application

00:08:22.963 --> 00:08:26.120
where I feel like this
solution is just so obvious

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.580
I wonder why it didn't exist before.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:33.010
- Intubation is literally
the process of putting a tube

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:34.030
into a patient.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.110
The purpose is to breathe for the patient

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.260
when the patient isn't breathing.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.600
And so traditionally a highly
trained medical professional

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.010
would take their laryngoscope,

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.550
come above the patient,

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.660
and once they see the trachea,

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.823
you start to pass your tube down inside.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.970
I'm almost there, I can see the light.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:56.240
So if you can see right now

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.890
I just got it in to the trachea.

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.190
- Oh yeah.
- Right there.

00:09:02.097 --> 00:09:04.850
And it took me a couple of minutes

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:08.470
and I was really kind of
wrenching on this patient here

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.050
as if there's somebody
who's not breathing.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.450
Every second counts.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.660
- But by using a miniature
version of this vine robot,

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.090
researchers are hoping to make
intubation faster and safer.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.400
- You know, somebody
like me with no training

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.410
could pretty simply insert this device

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.410
aimed towards the nose and...

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.930
(object squealing)

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:31.763
just like that.

00:09:31.763 --> 00:09:35.470
If you can see, we've already intubated,

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:38.833
and all it took was a little
bit of pressurization.

00:09:38.833 --> 00:09:39.700
(man laughs)

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.533
Just like that.

00:09:40.533 --> 00:09:42.740
- It almost looks like
sort of a party favor.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:43.573
- Yeah, right.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.300
This reminds me a lot of those inflatable

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.970
kind of like play-doh
structures you see at car lots.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.440
- How does it know to
go down the right tube?

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.630
- Yeah, so that's one of
the kind of cool things

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:56.620
about soft robotics,

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.710
is the robot is quite compliant.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:00.620
And we see that in a lot of these demos,

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.930
you know, they can squish, they can bend.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:04.120
And so how we've designed it

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.510
is that the main robot grows
down into the esophagus,

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:08.770
and then we have this side branch

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.820
that heads towards the trachea,

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.320
and it's quite flexible

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.320
and so it basically finds the opening.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.060
So it's a really neat example

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.370
of kind of a passive intelligence,

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.240
mechanical intelligence
some people call it,

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.030
where it can find its path

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.583
even if we don't know
exactly the shape beforehand.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.810
- Have you tried this
on a real person yet?

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.070
- Not on a real person,

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.890
but we've actually tried
this in a cadaver lab.

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.350
And we've shown that we can move

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.830
from this nice idealized version

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:39.960
to an actual in-vivo situation

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.530
and successfully intubate a patient.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:43.890
- There's another application

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:48.150
which is burrowing into sand or soil.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.220
When you blow compressed air
into something like sand,

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.660
it fluidizes, it becomes like a liquid,

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.460
and that can allow the vine robot

00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:00.710
to grow into granular materials like sand.

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:01.930
- If you've ever been to the beach

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:05.540
and you try to stick like you
umbrella pole into the ground,

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.750
it's fairly difficult.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.820
- And I'm trying to push that
probe down into the sand,

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.720
no fluid decision.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:14.740
- Yeah, it feels like it
sort of gets wedged in there.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.526
- Let's now turn on the air.

00:11:16.526 --> 00:11:17.359
(air hissing)

00:11:17.359 --> 00:11:18.630
- Oh yeah.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.030
You can feel it immediately.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.493
Oh, wow.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.220
Yeah, that's a lot.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.460
- So what we've done here is essentially,

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.640
we just blow a jet of air
out the front of the robot

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.310
and that loosens up the sand enough

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.130
to reduce the force of the sand

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.270
so that the robot just by tip extension

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.585
can make its way through.

00:11:37.585 --> 00:11:40.085
(air hissing)

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.360
- This makes vine robots an
attractive option for NASA

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.110
when they look for ways
to study the surfaces

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.297
of other planets.

00:11:56.297 --> 00:11:59.130
(machine roaring)

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.700
Recently on Mars

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.010
they tried to have a burrowing
robot but it got stuck.

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:07.820
Could you do it better
basically with this?

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:08.653
- Yeah, that's a good question.

00:12:08.653 --> 00:12:12.320
So the Mars InSight mission,
they have this heat probe,

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.760
the idea there was to be able
to sort of hammer its way

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.010
down into the core,
and then place a sensor

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.780
that could detect the temperature of Mars.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.540
However, the problem they ran into there

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.450
is that it turned out the
material that they put it in

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.370
was more cohesive than they expected.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:27.203
Inside the robot

00:12:27.203 --> 00:12:29.300
something would wind up
and then pound it down,

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.740
wind up and pound it down.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.050
But it turned out there
wasn't enough friction

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:34.463
between the probe and the sand.

00:12:34.463 --> 00:12:35.810
So what was really happening

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:39.090
was it would wind up pound
down, wind up pound down,

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:40.050
wind up pound down.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.370
So it never actually got anywhere.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:43.230
The advantage of something
like this, like tip extension,

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.640
is you'd have your base,
you start at the surface

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.940
and you just keep extending your way down.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.910
You're not necessarily
relying on the interaction

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.260
with what is surrounding
it to make it work.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.510
- What amazes me about vine robots

00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:01.470
is how a plant inspired
this simple, elegant design.

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.920
It's so easy in fact that
you could build one yourself

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.440
in as little as a minute.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.060
There are instructions
online that I'll link to.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.440
But from that basic design

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.600
have come a huge variety of robots

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.010
with different applications,

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:17.200
from archeology to search and rescue,

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.670
or intubation to space exploration.

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:24.369
And what else can you
think of to do with it?

00:13:24.369 --> 00:13:27.452
(electronic buzzing)

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.860
Hey, this video is
sponsored by Morning Brew,

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.300
the free daily newsletter
that gets you up to speed

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.630
on business, finance and
tech, in just five minutes.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:39.870
For some years now, my main
method of procrastinating

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.330
has been scrolling through news websites.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:43.260
And to prevent that,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.960
I've tried cutting news
out of my life altogether,

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.750
but I still wanna stay informed.

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:50.180
So Morning Brew offers
the perfect middle ground.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.940
It's delivered to my inbox every
morning, seven days a week,

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.400
and it's witty and informative
unlike traditional news.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.130
Plus it gives me
everything I need to know,

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.910
so I don't have to check news
sites multiple times a day

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:04.290
to make sure that I'm not missing
something, like inflation,

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:06.560
which is currently running
at its highest rate

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.940
in nearly nine years.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.520
Or the impending Boba shortage

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.320
due to supply chain
disruptions caused by COVID.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.630
Boba is a big deal in this household.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.960

business, finance and tech,

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.110
