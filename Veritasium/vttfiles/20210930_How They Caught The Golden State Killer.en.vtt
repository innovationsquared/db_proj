00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:03.206
This video includes a
discussion of serious crimes

00:00:03.206 --> 00:00:05.226
which may be disturbing for some viewers

00:00:05.226 --> 00:00:07.766
so I wanted to let you know that upfront,

00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.276
but I think it's necessary

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:11.566
to talk about these crimes in some detail

00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.979
for reasons that will become apparent.

00:00:16.426 --> 00:00:20.596
In the small town of Visalia,
California in the mid 1970s,

00:00:20.596 --> 00:00:24.106
one of the state's most prolific
criminals got his start.

00:00:24.106 --> 00:00:27.946
He repeatedly broke into
houses and stole small items

00:00:27.946 --> 00:00:30.636
like cash, coins, and jewelry.

00:00:30.636 --> 00:00:33.626
He was dubbed the Visalia ransacker

00:00:33.626 --> 00:00:36.456
but soon his crimes escalated.

00:00:36.456 --> 00:00:38.386
- Six months later in 1976,

00:00:38.386 --> 00:00:40.126
he moves up to Sacramento and over

00:00:40.126 --> 00:00:41.726
the course of the next three years,

00:00:41.726 --> 00:00:45.296
he's moving all across Northern California

00:00:45.296 --> 00:00:47.766
committing numerous sexual assaults,

00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.826
over 50 sexual assaults.

00:00:49.826 --> 00:00:52.766
- Here, he was called
the east area rapist.

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.036
- [Male Reporter] The police
are saying lock up tight.

00:00:55.036 --> 00:00:58.429
Sacramento's infamous east area
rapist may still be in town.

00:00:59.446 --> 00:01:03.226
- And then in 1979, he moves
down to Southern California,

00:01:03.226 --> 00:01:06.476
starting in Santa Barbara
and starts killing.

00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:08.416
And he was known as the
original night stalker

00:01:08.416 --> 00:01:09.946
in Southern California.

00:01:09.946 --> 00:01:12.236
- [Reporter] Variously known
as the east area rapist

00:01:12.236 --> 00:01:14.206
and the original night stalker,

00:01:14.206 --> 00:01:17.136
these were brutal
meticulously planned crimes

00:01:17.136 --> 00:01:19.396
that spanned numerous California counties

00:01:19.396 --> 00:01:22.856
between 1976 and 1986.

00:01:22.856 --> 00:01:24.976
- Police believed that all of these crimes

00:01:24.976 --> 00:01:27.326
were committed by the same person

00:01:27.326 --> 00:01:30.006
now known as the golden state killer.

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:32.066
How was it known that these were committed

00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.176
by the same person?

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:36.531
- Investigators were relying on MO.

00:01:36.531 --> 00:01:38.947
MO, modus operandi is basically

00:01:38.947 --> 00:01:43.086
how a criminal will commit a crime.

00:01:43.086 --> 00:01:46.962
- He was wearing some
type of a mask or a hood.

00:01:46.962 --> 00:01:49.136
He was wearing shorts and a T-shirt.

00:01:49.136 --> 00:01:51.816
- The golden state killer
had a very distinctive MO

00:01:51.816 --> 00:01:52.716
- What he would do is

00:01:52.716 --> 00:01:56.266
he would break into a house with a gun,

00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:58.376
a house with a man and a woman.

00:01:58.376 --> 00:02:00.196
He would tie them up

00:02:01.226 --> 00:02:04.386
tell the man I'm gonna
put plates on your back.

00:02:04.386 --> 00:02:05.866
If I hear those plates move,

00:02:05.866 --> 00:02:08.566
I'm going to kill your
wife and then kill you,

00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:11.636
take the wife into another
room and sexually assault her.

00:02:11.636 --> 00:02:16.066
Then he would go through the
house for however much time,

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:19.276
eating, stealing stuff, stealing
little things or whatever

00:02:19.276 --> 00:02:20.586
and then he would leave.

00:02:20.586 --> 00:02:24.066
- How was he not caught based
on fingerprint evidence?

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:26.046
- Well, he didn't leave his fingerprints.

00:02:26.046 --> 00:02:27.106
He always wore a mask.

00:02:27.106 --> 00:02:28.306
He always had gloves on.

00:02:28.306 --> 00:02:30.916
This was an offender that did everything

00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:32.896
to prevent himself from being caught.

00:02:32.896 --> 00:02:34.486
- [Reporter] The golden
state killer has been linked

00:02:34.486 --> 00:02:37.066
to at least 12 murders, 50 rapes

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:39.699
and a string of burglaries
throughout California.

00:02:43.864 --> 00:02:45.222
- All right, how's it going?

00:02:45.222 --> 00:02:46.506
- How you doing?
- Good.

00:02:46.506 --> 00:02:49.926
- So we supply DNA sequencing solutions

00:02:49.926 --> 00:02:53.136
to the forensic laboratories
that process crime scene DNA.

00:02:53.136 --> 00:02:55.831
At a crime scene, there's
typically less than a nanogram

00:02:55.831 --> 00:03:00.406
of DNA left and it's
usually degraded, right?

00:03:00.406 --> 00:03:02.426
So it breaks down.
- Why is there so little?

00:03:02.426 --> 00:03:03.426
at a crime scene?

00:03:03.426 --> 00:03:04.296
A nanogram?

00:03:04.296 --> 00:03:05.129
- Yes.

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.962
- That's insane.

00:03:05.962 --> 00:03:06.795
- Yes.

00:03:06.795 --> 00:03:09.786
- There's no accident
that he stops in 1986.

00:03:09.786 --> 00:03:14.786
1986 is when the first
DNA case of a murder case

00:03:15.486 --> 00:03:18.776
is actually solved with DNA and he's,

00:03:18.776 --> 00:03:22.386
I think he's following that
and he's saying, you know what,

00:03:22.386 --> 00:03:26.256
what I'm doing here, I'm leaving my DNA.

00:03:26.256 --> 00:03:27.776
I can't do this anymore.

00:03:27.776 --> 00:03:29.736
- [Reporter] Investigator
Paul Holes tracked

00:03:29.736 --> 00:03:31.496
the golden state killer for decades.

00:03:31.496 --> 00:03:33.516
- He couldn't it account
for DNA technology

00:03:33.516 --> 00:03:35.566
and that really was his big mistake.

00:03:35.566 --> 00:03:37.176
That was the critical mistake.

00:03:37.176 --> 00:03:40.196
He left his DNA all over California.

00:03:40.196 --> 00:03:42.366
And it turns out that in three of the cases,

00:03:42.366 --> 00:03:44.826
I had three sexual assault
kits and that's where I got

00:03:44.826 --> 00:03:48.089
the golden state killer's
DNA from Northern California.

00:03:49.516 --> 00:03:52.866
- But having the unknown
killer's DNA wasn't enough.

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:56.276
They needed to match it to a known sample.

00:03:56.276 --> 00:03:58.806
In 1990, the FBI started work

00:03:58.806 --> 00:04:01.996
on what would become a
national genetic database.

00:04:01.996 --> 00:04:03.996
It mainly stores DNA profiles

00:04:03.996 --> 00:04:06.976
from convicted criminals
and persons of interest.

00:04:06.976 --> 00:04:10.076
It's called the combined DNA index system

00:04:10.076 --> 00:04:12.296
or CODIS for short.

00:04:12.296 --> 00:04:15.976
In each of your cells, there
are 23 pairs of chromosomes,

00:04:15.976 --> 00:04:18.656
one from your mom and one from your dad.

00:04:18.656 --> 00:04:21.126
And at particular places
on some chromosomes,

00:04:21.126 --> 00:04:23.646
there are short sections
of DNA that repeat

00:04:25.136 --> 00:04:30.136
like A A T G, A A T G, A A T G, and so on.

00:04:30.226 --> 00:04:34.366
These are called short
tandem repeats or STRs

00:04:34.366 --> 00:04:37.756
and different people have
different numbers of repeats.

00:04:37.756 --> 00:04:40.196
Forensic labs produce STR profiles

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:44.116
by counting up the number
of repeats at each location.

00:04:44.116 --> 00:04:46.976
Initially, there were
only 13 places on the DNA

00:04:46.976 --> 00:04:49.856
where STRs were counted, but in 2017

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:52.256
that was expanded to 20.

00:04:52.256 --> 00:04:55.166
It feels to me like that's
not that much information.

00:04:55.166 --> 00:04:56.306
- It isn't.

00:04:56.306 --> 00:04:58.206
- But the chances of two people having

00:04:58.206 --> 00:05:01.546
the exact same number of
repeats at all locations

00:05:01.546 --> 00:05:03.746
is incredibly small.

00:05:03.746 --> 00:05:05.946
The CODIS database now contains

00:05:05.946 --> 00:05:09.256
over 18 million STR profiles.

00:05:09.256 --> 00:05:12.366
- The golden state killer's
DNA profile has been up

00:05:12.366 --> 00:05:14.566
at the national DNA database

00:05:14.566 --> 00:05:18.336
that's run by the FBI
called CODIS since 2001

00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:22.136
and has been searching
ever since with no hits.

00:05:22.136 --> 00:05:24.086
We did Interpol searching,

00:05:24.086 --> 00:05:26.898
trying to search other
country's DNA databases thinking

00:05:26.898 --> 00:05:28.696
well, maybe he came from
a out of the country

00:05:28.696 --> 00:05:32.116
that's why after all this time we have yet

00:05:32.116 --> 00:05:33.726
to be able to identify him

00:05:33.726 --> 00:05:35.729
and obviously we didn't get any hits.

00:05:37.426 --> 00:05:41.176
- But genetic sequencing
technology was advancing rapidly.

00:05:41.176 --> 00:05:43.746
- [Female Reporter] The
genome project was completed.

00:05:43.746 --> 00:05:47.796
Since 1986 scientists had
been mapping and sequencing

00:05:47.796 --> 00:05:50.976
the three billion nucleotides contained

00:05:50.976 --> 00:05:52.446
in the human genome.

00:05:52.446 --> 00:05:53.416
It's anticipated that

00:05:53.416 --> 00:05:56.406
- Soon private companies
began offering genetic tests

00:05:56.406 --> 00:06:00.726
directly to consumers and they
provide far more genetic data

00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:03.306
than what's in the CODIS database.

00:06:03.306 --> 00:06:04.896
I traveled to Houston, Texas

00:06:04.896 --> 00:06:07.596
to visit Family Tree DNA headquarters.

00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:09.336
- We'll go in the lab
and we'll start talking

00:06:09.336 --> 00:06:11.797
about the life cycle of a sample.

00:06:11.797 --> 00:06:12.676
There you go.

00:06:12.676 --> 00:06:13.646
- Thank you.

00:06:13.646 --> 00:06:16.146
These samples, what are they?

00:06:16.146 --> 00:06:18.196
- So they're cheek cells.
They just scrape

00:06:18.196 --> 00:06:20.406
the inside of their cheek,
they put a cap on it

00:06:20.406 --> 00:06:21.576
and they send it back to us.

00:06:21.576 --> 00:06:23.216
- It's like a robot ballet.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:25.896
- Yes, so for DNA extraction,

00:06:25.896 --> 00:06:30.106
we need to remove all of the
protections that are on the DNA

00:06:30.106 --> 00:06:35.106
and just separate it by itself
so we can do testing on that.

00:06:36.576 --> 00:06:39.256
- Instead of looking at
20 places on your DNA,

00:06:39.256 --> 00:06:43.236
these tests examined 700 to 800,000.

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:45.116
- The Family Finder test is based

00:06:45.116 --> 00:06:47.216
on what's called a micro array

00:06:47.216 --> 00:06:49.536
and this is what a micro array looks like.

00:06:49.536 --> 00:06:52.726
Each one of those boxes is an individual.

00:06:52.726 --> 00:06:55.186
We can fit 24 individuals on here.

00:06:55.186 --> 00:06:59.956
And within that box is
about 710,000 positions

00:07:02.016 --> 00:07:06.066
of your DNA, that we're measuring,
we're getting data for.

00:07:06.066 --> 00:07:07.556
- 710,000?

00:07:07.556 --> 00:07:09.406
- Yes, and they're called snips.

00:07:09.406 --> 00:07:13.796
- So hang on, that's like 710,000

00:07:13.796 --> 00:07:16.476
individual bases, like ATGC?

00:07:16.476 --> 00:07:17.309
- Yes.

00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:20.691
- For each person, you can
measure 24 on that single chip?

00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:22.066
- Correct.

00:07:22.066 --> 00:07:25.906
- The human genome consists
of three billion bases.

00:07:25.906 --> 00:07:30.906
All people share about
99.9% the exact same DNA,

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:34.656
which means on average, only
about three million basis

00:07:34.656 --> 00:07:36.746
differ from person to person.

00:07:36.746 --> 00:07:38.986
These individual letter changes are known

00:07:38.986 --> 00:07:43.116
as single nucleotide
polymorphisms or SNPs.

00:07:43.116 --> 00:07:45.156
So on there, are there a whole bunch

00:07:45.156 --> 00:07:47.686
of like little pieces of DNA then?

00:07:47.686 --> 00:07:52.326
- Yes, so what we have
is a short piece of DNA

00:07:52.326 --> 00:07:54.976
that is specific to one SNP.

00:07:54.976 --> 00:07:58.046
So it's one position in the genome

00:07:58.046 --> 00:07:59.716
where we know there can be a difference.

00:07:59.716 --> 00:08:00.549
- Okay.

00:08:00.549 --> 00:08:03.956
Is there any example of a simple SNP

00:08:03.956 --> 00:08:06.226
that confers some sort of?

00:08:06.226 --> 00:08:09.446
- Actually blue eyes is
a single base change.

00:08:09.446 --> 00:08:10.279
- Really?

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:11.261
- Yeah.

00:08:11.261 --> 00:08:15.376
- So everyone with blue eyes
has this one letter change? - mm hmm

00:08:15.376 --> 00:08:18.519
- You can see now it's
starting to scan the first box.

00:08:22.196 --> 00:08:26.016
- The results of your
710,000 SNPs can tell you

00:08:26.016 --> 00:08:28.206
about your geographic ancestry

00:08:28.206 --> 00:08:29.976
or possible medical conditions,

00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:31.486
but they can also quantify

00:08:31.486 --> 00:08:34.096
how related you are to someone else.

00:08:34.096 --> 00:08:35.946
The genetics of having a kid

00:08:35.946 --> 00:08:39.506
are a bit like cutting two
decks of cards together.

00:08:39.506 --> 00:08:41.396
The resulting deck will share

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:44.176
about half its cards with each parent

00:08:44.176 --> 00:08:47.536
and there'll be long sequences of cards

00:08:47.536 --> 00:08:52.316
which match identically
sequences in each parent.

00:08:52.316 --> 00:08:57.316
Now, if this deck has a
kid, well then its offspring

00:08:57.446 --> 00:09:00.586
will share only about
a quarter of its cards

00:09:00.586 --> 00:09:05.116
with each grandparent and the
sections of identical cards

00:09:05.116 --> 00:09:09.076
will be shorter, and this
is how it works with DNA.

00:09:09.076 --> 00:09:11.106
The more closely you're
related to someone,

00:09:11.106 --> 00:09:13.446
the more DNA you share and the longer

00:09:13.446 --> 00:09:15.866
the blocks of identical DNA are.

00:09:15.866 --> 00:09:18.346
But to compare the DNA of two people,

00:09:18.346 --> 00:09:20.766
you don't need to read every letter.

00:09:20.766 --> 00:09:22.866
The snips are sprinkled throughout the DNA

00:09:22.866 --> 00:09:25.286
roughly every 2000 bases.

00:09:25.286 --> 00:09:28.586
So if you find long sections
where the snips match up,

00:09:28.586 --> 00:09:32.626
you can bet that the DNA
in between is identical too

00:09:32.626 --> 00:09:36.096
by comparing hundreds of
thousands of snips sprinkled

00:09:36.096 --> 00:09:37.276
throughout the DNA,

00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:40.906
you can see where these
identical blocks start and stop

00:09:40.906 --> 00:09:43.809
and so how much total DNA is shared.

00:09:44.966 --> 00:09:48.026
- Everywhere that is highlighted in blue

00:09:48.026 --> 00:09:50.529
is where I share DNA.

00:09:51.546 --> 00:09:53.166
- With your father?
- With my father

00:09:53.166 --> 00:09:54.906
which is exactly what you expect

00:09:54.906 --> 00:09:57.806
because I should share
DNA with him everywhere

00:09:57.806 --> 00:10:01.406
because he gave me 50% of my DNA.

00:10:01.406 --> 00:10:02.896
So this is a second to third cousin.

00:10:02.896 --> 00:10:05.396
I have no idea who this person is.

00:10:05.396 --> 00:10:07.096
And you can see here,

00:10:07.096 --> 00:10:11.486
we are definitely not as
closely related as me and my dad

00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:13.176
because where the blue is,

00:10:13.176 --> 00:10:15.366
those are the only
regions of the chromosome

00:10:15.366 --> 00:10:16.889
where we share DNA.

00:10:17.796 --> 00:10:20.006
- We all know that these genetic tests

00:10:20.006 --> 00:10:23.266
can help identify our
relatives but the question is,

00:10:23.266 --> 00:10:27.166
can you do the same thing with
law enforcement databases?

00:10:27.166 --> 00:10:31.416
Can you identify family members
using the CODIS database?

00:10:31.416 --> 00:10:33.406
- You can and it's only limited

00:10:33.406 --> 00:10:36.546
to really first order and
second order relatives.

00:10:36.546 --> 00:10:39.736
- That means if I'm looking
for the golden state killer,

00:10:39.736 --> 00:10:43.836
I'm looking for either his
father, his brother or his son.

00:10:43.836 --> 00:10:48.446
We did that over and
over again with no hits.

00:10:48.446 --> 00:10:49.636
- Why is it so limited?

00:10:49.636 --> 00:10:52.386
- Because you've only got 23 loci.

00:10:52.386 --> 00:10:54.796
If you wanna do proper kinship analysis,

00:10:54.796 --> 00:10:59.016
you need to have more points
assessed on that genome

00:10:59.016 --> 00:11:01.406
to see how related you really are.

00:11:01.406 --> 00:11:04.356
- We know the answer
is behind a locked door

00:11:04.356 --> 00:11:05.896
and the answer is behind the locked door

00:11:05.896 --> 00:11:08.616
of 23andMe and Ancestry.com.

00:11:08.616 --> 00:11:11.926
We know that they have
millions of profiles.

00:11:11.926 --> 00:11:15.376
Somebody related to him, a
second cousin I would guess,

00:11:15.376 --> 00:11:16.209
would be in there.

00:11:16.209 --> 00:11:17.306
- Sure.

00:11:17.306 --> 00:11:20.313
- And that was very hard to deal with.

00:11:20.313 --> 00:11:24.886
You know, that the answer is
there behind this locked door.

00:11:24.886 --> 00:11:27.306
- Law enforcement is not allowed to search

00:11:27.306 --> 00:11:30.866
the databases of 23andMe and Ancestry.com

00:11:30.866 --> 00:11:35.146
but luckily for investigators,
there was another way.

00:11:35.146 --> 00:11:38.206
An independent website called
GEDmatch had been set up

00:11:38.206 --> 00:11:40.616
to allow people to connect with relatives.

00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:41.836
You can upload the raw data

00:11:41.836 --> 00:11:44.286
from any of the big
genetic testing companies

00:11:44.286 --> 00:11:46.116
and search for matches.

00:11:46.116 --> 00:11:49.846
- So when we initially
search the GEDmatch database,

00:11:49.846 --> 00:11:52.656
our best hits come back at third cousins

00:11:52.656 --> 00:11:55.276
which means they shared
you know, our top hit,

00:11:55.276 --> 00:11:57.816
I think shared about 1% of the DNA.

00:11:57.816 --> 00:11:59.816
It's very little DNA that's shared

00:12:00.686 --> 00:12:03.216
but that's a starting data point.

00:12:03.216 --> 00:12:07.436
And theoretically, by taking
multiple of these individuals

00:12:07.436 --> 00:12:10.146
that share DNA and
building their family trees

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:13.366
using traditional genealogy
and public source documents

00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:15.356
like census records and obituaries

00:12:15.356 --> 00:12:19.256
and newspaper articles and findagrave.com,

00:12:19.256 --> 00:12:21.256
you build this family tree back

00:12:21.256 --> 00:12:23.376
until you get two of these relatives

00:12:23.376 --> 00:12:26.486
of the golden state killer,
you get them to intersect

00:12:26.486 --> 00:12:28.326
where now you see, oh, they've got,

00:12:28.326 --> 00:12:31.336
they share great-great grandparents together.

00:12:31.336 --> 00:12:34.756
Theoretically the golden
state killer is a descendant

00:12:34.756 --> 00:12:36.836
from those same great-great grandparents.

00:12:36.836 --> 00:12:40.256
So once I identify that common ancestor,

00:12:40.256 --> 00:12:43.286
it's now identifying
every single descendant

00:12:43.286 --> 00:12:45.846
from those great-great grandparents

00:12:45.846 --> 00:12:48.006
and this becomes a huge process.

00:12:48.006 --> 00:12:51.596
People in the 1840s would
typically have 15 kids.

00:12:51.596 --> 00:12:53.996
You have to identify each of those kids

00:12:53.996 --> 00:12:55.436
and then all of their children

00:12:55.436 --> 00:12:56.886
and then all of their children.

00:12:56.886 --> 00:13:00.976
So now we have this exponentially
growing family tree.

00:13:00.976 --> 00:13:03.376
- How wide did that tree get?

00:13:03.376 --> 00:13:07.366
- I think we had over 1000
individuals in that family tree

00:13:07.366 --> 00:13:11.226
but we knew a lot about our offender.

00:13:11.226 --> 00:13:14.376
We were confident he was
born between 1940 and 1960.

00:13:14.376 --> 00:13:15.836
We knew he was a white male.

00:13:15.836 --> 00:13:18.226
We knew he was 5'8" to 5'10".

00:13:18.226 --> 00:13:19.616
You know, he's in California.

00:13:19.616 --> 00:13:21.936
He's up in Sacramento in 1976.

00:13:21.936 --> 00:13:24.663
He's in Southern California in the '80s

00:13:24.663 --> 00:13:28.116
and we basically narrowed
it down to about five males

00:13:28.116 --> 00:13:30.046
and then it's just investigations.

00:13:30.046 --> 00:13:32.066
- With a suspect at their fingertips,

00:13:32.066 --> 00:13:33.486
this spring, they followed him

00:13:33.486 --> 00:13:36.266
to a Sacramento area Hobby Lobby store

00:13:36.266 --> 00:13:39.076
and took a DNA sample
from his car door handle.

00:13:39.076 --> 00:13:43.066
Days later, investigators
recovered another DNA sample

00:13:43.066 --> 00:13:46.486
from one discarded tissue
which registered a match

00:13:46.486 --> 00:13:49.436
to DNA evidence left at
one of the crime scenes.

00:13:49.436 --> 00:13:52.896
- Investigators in California
say DNA evidence led them

00:13:52.896 --> 00:13:56.336
to one of the country's most
notorious serial killers.

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:59.426
Former police officer
Joseph James DeAngelo

00:13:59.426 --> 00:14:01.976
was arrested yesterday and he is believed

00:14:01.976 --> 00:14:05.366
to be the so-called golden state killer.

00:14:05.366 --> 00:14:09.996
- For 44 years, countless
investigators have worked it

00:14:09.996 --> 00:14:11.756
and have failed to solve it.

00:14:11.756 --> 00:14:15.536
Within four and a half months,
a team of six were able

00:14:15.536 --> 00:14:18.016
to figure out who the
golden state killer was

00:14:18.016 --> 00:14:20.176
and that was Joseph DeAngelo.

00:14:20.176 --> 00:14:23.076
- After the golden state
killer was identified,

00:14:23.076 --> 00:14:26.706
the flood gates opened and
we were seeing every week

00:14:26.706 --> 00:14:29.406
not only single killers,
but multiple killers,

00:14:29.406 --> 00:14:32.396
serial killers, every
week were being identified

00:14:32.396 --> 00:14:34.682
from cases in the '70s and the '80s.

00:14:34.682 --> 00:14:36.816
- 'Cause, there's been over 70 cases now

00:14:36.816 --> 00:14:38.636
that they've solved this way

00:14:38.636 --> 00:14:42.466
and they continue to solve
them at a fairly regular rate

00:14:42.466 --> 00:14:43.516
and I think

00:14:43.516 --> 00:14:45.886
- Presumably that rate's
just gonna increase.

00:14:45.886 --> 00:14:46.719
- Yeah.

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:49.226
- And there's gonna be
more because it's working

00:14:49.226 --> 00:14:53.836
and we are going to
help find these people.

00:14:53.836 --> 00:14:55.676
- But the scary thing is in the US,

00:14:55.676 --> 00:14:58.456
you have 100,000 cold
case murders with DNA.

00:14:58.456 --> 00:15:01.216
You have more cold cases
but the ones with DNA

00:15:01.216 --> 00:15:03.116
is estimated about 100,000

00:15:03.116 --> 00:15:07.366
There's roughly about
650,000 sexual assaults,

00:15:07.366 --> 00:15:09.556
cold cases with DNA.
- With DNA?

00:15:09.556 --> 00:15:11.576
It seems like a real paradigm shift.

00:15:11.576 --> 00:15:12.409
- It is.

00:15:12.409 --> 00:15:14.966
Multiple law enforcement agencies has said

00:15:14.966 --> 00:15:19.966
that this is the most
revolutionary tool they've had

00:15:20.066 --> 00:15:22.746
since the adoption of the fingerprint.

00:15:22.746 --> 00:15:27.266
- With traditional DNA, it
required getting a sample

00:15:27.266 --> 00:15:28.746
from the actual individual.

00:15:28.746 --> 00:15:31.966
It's a one-to-one type of process.

00:15:31.966 --> 00:15:34.396
And so these offenders who let's say

00:15:34.396 --> 00:15:36.256
they have committed crimes
and haven't been caught

00:15:36.256 --> 00:15:39.376
and they're just living their
life and they're thinking,

00:15:39.376 --> 00:15:42.786
well, my DNA has never been taken from me.

00:15:42.786 --> 00:15:44.326
I may have left DNA in the case

00:15:44.326 --> 00:15:47.226
that I committed back in 1975,

00:15:47.226 --> 00:15:50.656
but they've never gotten
my DNA, they won't find me.

00:15:50.656 --> 00:15:53.386
But now we don't have to rely upon that.

00:15:53.386 --> 00:15:56.636
Somebody distantly
related to that offender

00:15:56.636 --> 00:15:59.706
has put their DNA into a database

00:15:59.706 --> 00:16:01.856
and they have to start getting nervous

00:16:01.856 --> 00:16:03.526
because that's outside of their control.

00:16:03.526 --> 00:16:06.056
They can't account for a third cousin

00:16:06.056 --> 00:16:08.726
or what that third cousin is doing.

00:16:08.726 --> 00:16:10.306
And so they start getting nervous.

00:16:10.306 --> 00:16:11.276
And I've kind of wondered

00:16:11.276 --> 00:16:14.346
how many of these individuals recognize

00:16:14.346 --> 00:16:16.146
that law enforcement is eventually gonna

00:16:16.146 --> 00:16:18.046
be knocking on their door as a result

00:16:18.046 --> 00:16:21.096
of a third cousin putting
their DNA in the database?

00:16:21.096 --> 00:16:24.981
- Each person who uploads
their information to a database

00:16:24.981 --> 00:16:26.766
illuminates the identities

00:16:26.766 --> 00:16:29.576
of hundreds of other people around them,

00:16:29.576 --> 00:16:33.426
parents, siblings, aunts,
and uncles and cousins.

00:16:33.426 --> 00:16:38.166
A study by ancestry DNA found
the average person in the UK

00:16:38.166 --> 00:16:43.166
has 175 third cousins and
it doesn't stop there.

00:16:43.666 --> 00:16:46.806
The DNA in one person will be shared

00:16:46.806 --> 00:16:50.206
by hundreds of people yet to be born.

00:16:50.206 --> 00:16:53.826
Children, grandchildren,
nieces, and nephews,

00:16:53.826 --> 00:16:56.786
and cousins once or twice removed.

00:16:56.786 --> 00:17:00.576
Realistically, each person
shares identifiable DNA

00:17:00.576 --> 00:17:05.376
with nearly 1000 people past and future.

00:17:05.376 --> 00:17:08.196
So it doesn't take many
people uploading their data

00:17:08.196 --> 00:17:12.636
to reveal the identities of
everyone living in a country.

00:17:12.636 --> 00:17:16.776
Back in 2018, a study found
that using an existing database

00:17:16.776 --> 00:17:21.686
of just 1.3 million people,
they could identify 60%

00:17:21.686 --> 00:17:24.506
of all Americans of European descent.

00:17:24.506 --> 00:17:26.506
And they estimated with
a database containing

00:17:26.506 --> 00:17:30.506
just 2% of the population,
you could find a third cousin

00:17:30.506 --> 00:17:34.419
or closer match in 99% of cases.

00:17:35.286 --> 00:17:38.696
- DNA storage is one of
the things that we have

00:17:38.696 --> 00:17:41.256
that is really unlike anything else.

00:17:41.256 --> 00:17:44.876
If you look inside, this is
at minus 20 degrees Celsius.

00:17:44.876 --> 00:17:47.206
- That keeps the DNA good for a long time?

00:17:47.206 --> 00:17:48.926
- We have DNA samples in here

00:17:48.926 --> 00:17:51.516
that are probably about 15 years old.

00:17:51.516 --> 00:17:53.876
- How many samples are stored in there?

00:17:53.876 --> 00:17:54.976
- Just over 2 million.

00:17:56.356 --> 00:17:57.726
- Wow.
- Yeah.

00:17:57.726 --> 00:17:59.706
So the capacity is just over 2 million.

00:17:59.706 --> 00:18:03.487
- 2 million people's DNA
stored in this one small room?

00:18:03.487 --> 00:18:04.966
- Correct.

00:18:04.966 --> 00:18:06.049
- Wow.

00:18:06.916 --> 00:18:10.426
By 2021, over 30 million people worldwide

00:18:10.426 --> 00:18:13.266
have taken a direct consumer genetic test,

00:18:13.266 --> 00:18:16.806
the majority of which are
through Ancestry and 23andMe,

00:18:16.806 --> 00:18:19.886
which do not currently
work with law enforcement

00:18:19.886 --> 00:18:23.496
but Family Tree DNA does.

00:18:23.496 --> 00:18:26.826
- If you ask Americans, should
we have a national database

00:18:26.826 --> 00:18:28.706
where everyone's logged in it?

00:18:28.706 --> 00:18:29.568
- As their DNA?

00:18:29.568 --> 00:18:32.336
- Yeah by their DNA and their name,

00:18:32.336 --> 00:18:34.885
most Americans will be
somewhat uncomfortable

00:18:34.885 --> 00:18:37.336
or potentially very
uncomfortable with that.

00:18:37.336 --> 00:18:39.456
But we're kind of sleepwalking
into that scenario.

00:18:39.456 --> 00:18:42.486
- There are some people who
are concerned with privacy.

00:18:42.486 --> 00:18:45.196
If anyone chooses or decides

00:18:45.196 --> 00:18:48.226
that they do not want their results

00:18:48.226 --> 00:18:50.416
to be used for law enforcement matching,

00:18:50.416 --> 00:18:52.266
they can remove themselves from that.

00:18:52.266 --> 00:18:54.596
- I do worry about genetic
information being used

00:18:54.596 --> 00:18:56.836
to discriminate against someone.

00:18:56.836 --> 00:18:58.716
- My biggest thing is health insurance.

00:18:58.716 --> 00:19:02.626
I worry about if you have
somebody's DNA profile

00:19:02.626 --> 00:19:05.566
and some laws enacted, it
gets in the wrong hands

00:19:05.566 --> 00:19:09.406
and they say that this
person has a proclivity,

00:19:09.406 --> 00:19:10.936
they're headed towards Parkinson's,

00:19:10.936 --> 00:19:13.356
they're headed towards
this, headed towards that

00:19:13.356 --> 00:19:15.666
and then rates skyrocket.

00:19:15.666 --> 00:19:20.036
That's the biggest place that
I see as a privacy concern.

00:19:20.036 --> 00:19:21.826
- Once your genetic
information is out there,

00:19:21.826 --> 00:19:22.659
it's out there.

00:19:22.659 --> 00:19:24.536
It's not like a credit card
where you can get a new one.

00:19:24.536 --> 00:19:25.856
Yeah you're giving away something

00:19:25.856 --> 00:19:27.769
that you don't know what it can do.

00:19:28.926 --> 00:19:31.066
- Well, yeah our information isn't ours

00:19:31.066 --> 00:19:32.036
in the first place.
- Right.

00:19:32.036 --> 00:19:35.096
- Our information is shared.

00:19:35.096 --> 00:19:36.716
- Yes with your relatives.

00:19:36.716 --> 00:19:39.176
- Yes.
- And although you may be

00:19:39.176 --> 00:19:40.646
adverse to this sort of thing,

00:19:40.646 --> 00:19:43.276
if they've already done it, if it,

00:19:43.276 --> 00:19:45.956
you know, in a way you're out there.

00:19:45.956 --> 00:19:48.936
- In society today, you have
very clearly had two camps.

00:19:48.936 --> 00:19:51.446
There are those that are very comfortable

00:19:51.446 --> 00:19:54.666
having their genome available
to be able to be searched

00:19:54.666 --> 00:19:56.046
for law enforcement purposes

00:19:56.046 --> 00:19:58.806
and there are others that
are not comfortable at all

00:19:58.806 --> 00:20:00.606
and that's okay.

00:20:00.606 --> 00:20:02.656
- The problem is of course,

00:20:02.656 --> 00:20:05.236
those people who don't want
theirs to be searchable

00:20:05.236 --> 00:20:07.856
could have their DNA
uploaded inadvertently

00:20:07.856 --> 00:20:09.556
by their relatives.

00:20:09.556 --> 00:20:10.546
Do you know what I mean?

00:20:10.546 --> 00:20:12.896
So like, if I don't want my DNA

00:20:12.896 --> 00:20:14.376
to be searchable by law enforcement

00:20:14.376 --> 00:20:16.826
but my sister uploads hers,
- Yes.

00:20:16.826 --> 00:20:20.626
- It's almost as good
as me doing it myself.

00:20:20.626 --> 00:20:23.316
- Right now, Family Tree DNA's policy

00:20:23.316 --> 00:20:28.016
is we only accept samples
from law enforcement

00:20:28.016 --> 00:20:29.886
under certain circumstances.

00:20:29.886 --> 00:20:34.616
It has to be a sexual assault,
identification of remains,

00:20:34.616 --> 00:20:39.406
DNA recovered from the
scene of a homicide.

00:20:39.406 --> 00:20:41.946
And we also do child abductions.

00:20:41.946 --> 00:20:43.286
So if there's a child that's kidnapped

00:20:43.286 --> 00:20:47.006
and there's DNA evidence,
we will process the DNA

00:20:47.006 --> 00:20:49.726
so that they can try to find
out who the abductor is.

00:20:49.726 --> 00:20:53.116
Those are the only cases
that we will accept.

00:20:53.116 --> 00:20:54.086
- Got it.

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:58.896
- Unfortunately now GEDmatch
has flipped off the switch

00:20:58.896 --> 00:21:01.836
and GEDmatch has actually
said that you don't all have

00:21:01.836 --> 00:21:05.446
to have your information
searched without opting in.

00:21:05.446 --> 00:21:06.279
- Right.

00:21:06.279 --> 00:21:07.406
- Was that decision by GEDmatch

00:21:07.406 --> 00:21:10.866
a direct result of this
golden state killer case?

00:21:10.866 --> 00:21:11.699
- No, it wasn't.
- No.

00:21:11.699 --> 00:21:12.613
- Wanna tell the story?

00:21:12.613 --> 00:21:16.626
- You know, it had to do with a Utah case.

00:21:16.626 --> 00:21:20.346
- Where an elderly woman was
playing the organ in a church.

00:21:20.346 --> 00:21:22.920
- And there was an individual who broke in

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.686
and assaulted her.

00:21:25.686 --> 00:21:28.736
- But it wasn't a sexual assault,
but it's a serious crime.

00:21:28.736 --> 00:21:30.586
- I think believed, tried to strangle her

00:21:30.586 --> 00:21:31.419
and left her for dead.

00:21:31.419 --> 00:21:35.116
I believe he thought that she
was obviously dead and left.

00:21:35.116 --> 00:21:38.806
The police I believe approached GEDmatch

00:21:38.806 --> 00:21:40.966
because that they were concerned

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:44.046
that he was going to
recommit other crimes.

00:21:44.046 --> 00:21:46.056
- But GEDmatch's terms of service said

00:21:46.056 --> 00:21:47.496
they would only help law enforcement

00:21:47.496 --> 00:21:49.646
in cases of rape or homicide.

00:21:49.646 --> 00:21:52.686
- Her problem was that she didn't die.

00:21:52.686 --> 00:21:53.846
- 'Cause if she died then?

00:21:53.846 --> 00:21:56.086
- If she died it would
have fit the conditions

00:21:56.086 --> 00:21:57.616
and then they would
have uploaded the sample

00:21:57.616 --> 00:21:58.936
because it met the terms

00:21:58.936 --> 00:22:00.186
of service and everything.
- So what happened?

00:22:00.186 --> 00:22:01.956
They didn't take that case?

00:22:01.956 --> 00:22:02.789
- They did.

00:22:03.836 --> 00:22:06.176
- They subsequently caught the individual

00:22:06.176 --> 00:22:09.619
from that search that they
performed on GEDmatch.

00:22:10.726 --> 00:22:15.206
- But people within the
genealogy world kinda got

00:22:15.206 --> 00:22:18.626
their passions and flame
saying that is stepping outside

00:22:18.626 --> 00:22:20.376
of what this tool should be used for

00:22:20.376 --> 00:22:23.446
and they ended up putting a
lot of pressure on GEDmatch.

00:22:23.446 --> 00:22:26.336
- They flipped the switch
because they got freaked out.

00:22:26.336 --> 00:22:27.186
- But at the end of the day,

00:22:27.186 --> 00:22:29.396
it was a violation of terms of service.

00:22:29.396 --> 00:22:32.496
And I think ultimately
led to a good thing.

00:22:32.496 --> 00:22:33.796
Everybody got zeroed out

00:22:33.796 --> 00:22:36.226
and then everybody gets to sign back in.

00:22:36.226 --> 00:22:41.166
- Subsequently GEDmatch
was sold to Verogen.

00:22:41.166 --> 00:22:43.546
- I can tell you a new user today

00:22:43.546 --> 00:22:47.606
when they sign up for
GEDmatch, about 73% of them

00:22:47.606 --> 00:22:51.336
are signing up to allow
law enforcement to search.

00:22:51.336 --> 00:22:52.476
We're pretty happy with that.

00:22:52.476 --> 00:22:55.026
- Yeah I mean, that's, it's a high number.

00:22:55.026 --> 00:22:56.116
- It's a high number.

00:22:56.116 --> 00:22:59.176
- And it suggests that
people want that innocence.

00:22:59.176 --> 00:23:01.736
- How many second cousins
or third cousins do you now?

00:23:01.736 --> 00:23:02.569
You know what I mean?

00:23:02.569 --> 00:23:04.316
You don't know that many of them.

00:23:04.316 --> 00:23:08.716
Without even knowing it,
you're helping justice.

00:23:08.716 --> 00:23:13.496
You're helping a victim's family
get a little bit of peace,

00:23:13.496 --> 00:23:15.896
not closure, but a little bit of peace

00:23:15.896 --> 00:23:16.989
and why not?
- They get an answer.

00:23:16.989 --> 00:23:18.566
- Partly, you could make an argument

00:23:18.566 --> 00:23:23.526
that if you wanna be an activist
helping catch criminals,

00:23:23.526 --> 00:23:24.866
one of the best things you can do

00:23:24.866 --> 00:23:29.186
is encourage everyone
you know to be tested

00:23:29.186 --> 00:23:30.466
and put in the database.

00:23:30.466 --> 00:23:34.196
- Correct and you know, there are millions

00:23:34.196 --> 00:23:37.466
of people who have
tested at other companies

00:23:37.466 --> 00:23:39.976
that are not working with law enforcement.

00:23:39.976 --> 00:23:44.136
And if they want to
help, all they have to do

00:23:44.136 --> 00:23:47.926
is download their raw data and
they can upload it for free

00:23:47.926 --> 00:23:49.596
into our database.

00:23:49.596 --> 00:23:53.516
- I absolutely believe in a
person's right to privacy.

00:23:53.516 --> 00:23:56.176
But I also absolutely
believe we have a right not

00:23:56.176 --> 00:23:58.711
to get murdered or sexually
assaulted or it will be part

00:23:58.711 --> 00:24:02.476
having violent crimes
committed against us.

00:24:02.476 --> 00:24:04.986
There has to be an equal balance.

00:24:04.986 --> 00:24:08.276
- That scale of my privacy has been taken

00:24:08.276 --> 00:24:10.816
because of a third cousin
has been identified

00:24:10.816 --> 00:24:12.276
versus a mother who's talking

00:24:12.276 --> 00:24:14.176
about her daughter has been murdered,

00:24:14.176 --> 00:24:17.376
that scale is way the hell like this.

00:24:17.376 --> 00:24:20.706
- We're at a point now where
in many ways technology

00:24:20.706 --> 00:24:24.786
has kind of outstripped
where the laws are.

00:24:24.786 --> 00:24:29.786
I truly believe that
ultimately this tool and the,

00:24:31.086 --> 00:24:33.726
all the concerns with
it will probably end up

00:24:33.726 --> 00:24:35.876
in front of the nation Supreme Court

00:24:35.876 --> 00:24:37.476
and there will be a decision.

00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:40.866
My bottom line message, if
you're gonna make a decision,

00:24:40.866 --> 00:24:43.016
if there's gonna be laws
restricting law enforcement

00:24:43.016 --> 00:24:46.966
to use it, make sure that you're
making an informed decision

00:24:46.966 --> 00:24:50.056
and not assuming what it is based on

00:24:50.056 --> 00:24:52.616
its DNA and genetics and law enforcement

00:24:52.616 --> 00:24:55.536
because it really isn't
what you think it is.

00:24:55.536 --> 00:24:57.476
- I gotta keep a couple
of million people happy

00:24:57.476 --> 00:25:01.386
so that I have access to the
identities, kind of in a sense.

00:25:01.386 --> 00:25:02.826
- In a sense, right?
- Of millions,

00:25:02.826 --> 00:25:04.116
of hundreds of millions of people.

00:25:04.116 --> 00:25:04.949
- Right.

00:25:05.906 --> 00:25:07.616
- And that's a pretty selective sample.

00:25:07.616 --> 00:25:08.866
These are people who are willing

00:25:08.866 --> 00:25:10.316
to give up their information
- Give up, yes.

00:25:10.316 --> 00:25:12.086
- To find their ancestors.
- Yeah.

00:25:12.086 --> 00:25:14.836
- There may be many others
who are militantly private

00:25:14.836 --> 00:25:17.227
but they don't get a say in the decision

00:25:17.227 --> 00:25:19.976
of whether they're gonna be searchable

00:25:19.976 --> 00:25:21.736
through that person or not.

00:25:21.736 --> 00:25:24.699
- True, that's the choice you make.

00:25:25.555 --> 00:25:27.046
- That's the choice you don't make.

00:25:27.046 --> 00:25:29.686
- It's a choice you
don't make but it's also

00:25:29.686 --> 00:25:31.886
it's the choice we have
to make as a society,

00:25:31.886 --> 00:25:33.516
is what's that balance.

00:25:33.516 --> 00:25:35.506
There is always gonna be winners and loses

00:25:35.506 --> 00:25:36.339
in my mind, right?

00:25:36.339 --> 00:25:39.256
And I don't wanna use losers
in the negative sense there

00:25:39.256 --> 00:25:42.336
but in a decision at the end of the day,

00:25:42.336 --> 00:25:44.786
you have to balance in my mind

00:25:44.786 --> 00:25:48.256
the public safety with the public privacy.

00:25:48.256 --> 00:25:50.826
- Is DuckDuckGo, is that good?

00:25:50.826 --> 00:25:51.659
- I use it.

00:25:51.659 --> 00:25:53.779
I'm a little paranoid.

00:25:55.206 --> 00:26:00.076
So it's supposed to not track
you as much I guess, but yeah.

00:26:07.146 --> 00:26:10.526
- I have been working on this
video for a couple of years

00:26:10.526 --> 00:26:13.226
so I really wanna thank
Brilliant for sponsoring it.

00:26:13.226 --> 00:26:14.376
I appreciate their willingness

00:26:14.376 --> 00:26:18.116
to support me tackling
complex and important stories.

00:26:18.116 --> 00:26:19.976
Brilliant is a website, an app

00:26:19.976 --> 00:26:22.346
that teaches you all
kinds of stem concepts

00:26:22.346 --> 00:26:24.816
in an interactive and in-depth way,

00:26:24.816 --> 00:26:26.286
if you wanna learn more about DNA

00:26:26.286 --> 00:26:28.626
or solving mysteries
with deductive reasoning,

00:26:28.626 --> 00:26:29.836
I would recommend their courses

00:26:29.836 --> 00:26:32.716
on computational biology and logic.

00:26:32.716 --> 00:26:34.896
Check out this interactive logic puzzle.

00:26:34.896 --> 00:26:38.076
You have to figure out if
the light is on or off,

00:26:38.076 --> 00:26:40.846
knowing that some of the
characters may be lying to you.

00:26:40.846 --> 00:26:42.856
And instead of just
telling you the solution,

00:26:42.856 --> 00:26:45.396
Brilliant allows you to try
different configurations

00:26:45.396 --> 00:26:47.756
and discover the answer for yourself.
