00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.120
- These are bacteria growing into
increasingly concentrated antibiotics.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:06.750
The bacteria stop growing

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.450
when they hit the first antibiotic strip,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.260
but then a mutant appears
capable of surviving

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.820
in the antibiotic.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.610
Then another mutation occurs

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.910
and now the bacteria can survive
10 times the concentration,

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.000
then a hundred times,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.010
and finally, after just
11 days of evolution,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.370
these bacteria can survive antibiotics

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.020
a thousand times stronger

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.150
than what would have
killed them at the start.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.420
You're watching evolution in action.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.460
This video was sponsored by Bounty,

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.520
reminding you that a hygienic
way to clean up messes

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.480
and spills is with paper towel.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.300
Now, bacteria are everywhere,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.040
especially in damp places like dishcloths.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.610
So I'm gonna do a little experiment

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.890
where I add some fluorescent
powder to this dishcloth

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.970
to represent bacteria

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.970
without telling anyone in my household.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.890
And then I'm gonna come back later

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.700
to see where all of this powder ends up.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.360
But for now, I'm off to Michigan

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.690
to see the world's longest-running
evolution experiment.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.727
Let's go.

00:01:04.727 --> 00:01:06.534
(plane engine roaring)

00:01:06.534 --> 00:01:09.701
(bright upbeat music)

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.970
- This is Richard Lenski.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.450
He started the experiment 33 years ago,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.320
and along with a team of colleagues,

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.493
he has kept it going even
on weekends ever since.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.660
In this lab are 12 flasks
of live E. coli bacteria.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.030
They are the lucky few,
the ones that have survived

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.710
over three decades of evolution in a lab.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.670
- So there are 12 long-term lines.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.330
- [Derek] In 1988, a
single common ancestor

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.830
spawned these 12 separate populations.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.080
And ever since that day,

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.570
they have been growing and
dividing independently.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.960
So how have they evolved?

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.300
There are other long running
evolution experiments

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.980
like since 1896,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.630
scientists at the University of Illinois

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.670
have selectively bred corn,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.840
but they get only one generation per year,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.250
whereas these bacteria go through six

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.100
or seven generations a day.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.600
So after 33 years,

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.600
the bacteria in these flasks
are generation 74,500.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.360
If those were human generations,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.973
it would represent 1.5 million
years of hominid evolution.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.960
- What we do to start the experiment

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.130
is we dilute a large
population of bacteria

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.850
onto a Petri dish and each
individual cell makes a colony.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.190
And so then we take a
little bit from one colony

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.400
to start one population,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.740
a little bit from another colony

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.320
to start another population,

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.320
but effectively they all
started from individual cells.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.460
And that's important because it means

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.540
if we see the same thing happening
in replicate populations,

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.080
it's not because they started out

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.540
with the same genetic variants

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.330
and natural selection just fished out

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.740
the same thing over and over.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.370
You actually had to have
independent mutations

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.860
that would give rise to
these competitive advantages,

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.000
whatever it might be that
would produce the repeatability

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.713
across the 12 replicate populations.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.660
- [Derek] The lab
environment is very different

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.610
from the one the bacteria are used to.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.930
It's much simpler,

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.930
there are no other organisms present,

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.950
they're kept at 37 degrees Celsius,

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.180
and they live in the same solution,

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.700
a mixture including glucose,
potassium phosphate, citrate,

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.280
and a few other things.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.690
Their only carbon source is
glucose, which is limited.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.870
- Above all else,

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.530
consuming that glucose and
converting it to offspring,

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.410
replicating as fast as possible

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.900
has been essentially what
we seem to be selecting for.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.660
- [Derek] Every day in each flask

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.570
the bacteria divide six or seven times,

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.840
which increases their
numbers a hundred fold.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.440
Normally we think of generations

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.140
as being limited by the
time that has elapsed,

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.000
but in the case of these bacteria,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.090
they're limited by the
resources available to them.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.930
If they had 10 times the solution,

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.840
they would increase their
numbers an additional 10 times.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.710
Then almost every day
for the past 33 years

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.610
this transfer process has taken place.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.740
0.1 milliliters or 1% of
the solution from each flask

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.660
is transferred to a sterile new flask

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.630
containing the same solution.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.200
It essentially dilutes the
bacteria a hundred fold.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.300
This gives them the space and resources

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.760
they need to grow and divide again,

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.580
increasing their
population a hundred times

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.360
before this same process
is repeated the next day.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.150
And then the day after that
and the day after that,

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.970
even on weekends,

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.710
this process has been going
on for over three decades.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.160
What happens to bacteria
that are not transferred

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.350
to the new flasks, the 99%?

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.340
- That's the autoclave room.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.610
- [Derek] What happens
in the autoclave room?

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.240
- Every day 99% of the
E. Coli meet their demise

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.960
in this horrible room.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.940
- [Derek] Is this like
a bacterial crematorium?

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.281
- Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

00:05:01.473 --> 00:05:03.970
- [Derek] You can imagine if
the scientists didn't do this,

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.760
but instead gave all the bacteria

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.800
a hundred times more solution
to grow on every day,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.720
well, the experiment would
soon become unmanageable.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.270
On day two, you would need
a cubic meter of solution,

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.450
but by day 13 the experiment would be

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.970
10 times the volume of earth.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.630
And by day 42,

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.428
the experiment would fill up
the entire observable universe.

00:05:26.428 --> 00:05:29.210
To me it seems like the
whole idea of genetics

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.650
is for them to stay constant

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.460
and for mutations to be rare.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.293
- Yes.

00:05:33.293 --> 00:05:36.420
- Yet in your experiment
it seems they're not rare.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.390
- So we estimate that in our bacteria

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.140
only about one out of maybe a hundred

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.120
or one out of a thousand cells

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.890
will have even a single mutation.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.190
So that's not very much.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.310
By contrast, in humans it's
estimated that each one

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.260
of our offspring has perhaps
10, 20, 50 new mutations.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.210
So the bacteria are
extremely conservative,

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.670
but they're also billions of
them and even a tiny flask.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.390
And so if you have a chance
in a thousand of mutating

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.240
and you have a billion individuals,

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.840
then every day in one of these flasks

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.580
we might have a million new mutations.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.080
So that's a lot of variation

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.900
on which natural selection can act.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.460
Maybe half of those mutations
have no effect whatsoever

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.050
on the bacteria's ability to grow

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.090
and thrive in that particular environment.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.620
They might be mutations that would matter

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.940
out in the great outdoors,

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.570
but this was a very simple environment,

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.020
maybe those genes aren't even expressed.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.790
Another half of the mutations
speaking very, very roughly

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.610
might actually be deleterious mutations.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.350
They make the bacteria
an inferior competitor,

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.570
but there's maybe out of
those million mutations

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:43.890
that occur every day,

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.920
maybe there's 10, maybe there's a hundred,

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.200
maybe there's a thousand of them

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.820
that actually change something in the cell

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.320
that gives the bacteria
a competitive advantage

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.710
over their progenitors.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.600
And those then grow over
the course of that day.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.190
Then every day 99% of the
population is eliminated.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.340
It's lucky 1% prevails,

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.120
and if those lucky 1%
include one of the guys

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.410
from the previous day that
was growing at 10% faster

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:10.480
than the other guys,

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.020
it has a higher
probability of contributing

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.501
to that next flask, the next day's flask

00:07:16.501 --> 00:07:18.250
and in the fresh medium,

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.750
and it will continue to
grow faster at a 10% clip,

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.810
and that compounds by
an exponential process.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:28.420
So the mutations, y'know, are
really rare when they first occur

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.950
and many of them are lost,

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.140
but once they get common

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.150
if they have that competitive advantage,

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.070
they'll just sweep through the population.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.810
- [Derek] But how do you
know that the bacteria

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.510
actually have a competitive advantage?

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.990
I mean, how can you tell that
they're getting better suited

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.660
to their environment?

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.670
Well, this is where one
of the unique properties

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.360
of bacteria come in.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.200
They can be frozen for
long periods of time

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.770
and then revived.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.290
- And so they're stored in
suspended animation here.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.600
So these are the racks that
contain the frozen samples

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.760
of the bacteria from
the various generations.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.260
- [Derek] Every 500
generations, roughly 75 days,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.480
they freeze a sample of each population.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.310
By freezing previous generations,

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.423
Lenski and his team have
a frozen fossil record.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.010
- So our samples from over 30 years ago

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.880
remain perfectly viable.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.250
And so that gives us an ability to do

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.040
what I like to call time travel.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.800
We can literally compare
organisms that lived

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.560
at different points in time.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.850
So we can compete bacteria

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.950
from generation 70,000
against their ancestor.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.010
- [Derek] That's right.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:38.500
The way they measure
fitness is by competing

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.230
the current generation of bacteria

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.350
against older generations.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.298
It's like a strange bacteria fight club.

00:08:45.298 --> 00:08:46.670
- Hey!

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.730
- [Derek] They thaw
out the old generation,

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.110
mix it into a flask with
the current generation,

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.040
and then plate out a
sample of the solution

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.580
to see the relative abundances

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.970
of the two populations at the start.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.810
Then they incubate the flask for a day,

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.750
and then plate them out again.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.960
And the point is to compare
their relative growth rates,

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.170
which generation was better
able to utilize the glucose

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:09.753
and divide faster?

00:09:11.423 --> 00:09:12.580
- Well, how the heck do you
tell the evolve bacterium

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:13.630
from its ancestor?

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.427
Do they wave little flags at you and say,

00:09:15.427 --> 00:09:16.710
"Hey, I'm the evolved guy."

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.290
And of course they don't.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.485
But what we have is this color marker

00:09:21.485 --> 00:09:23.280
embedded in the experiment.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.070
So six of our populations on
a certain kind of agar plate

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.350
make red colonies and six
of them make white colonies.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.550
And we have one version of the ancestor

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.740
that makes red colonies and
one that makes white colonies.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.850
We can compete one of the
red evolved populations

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.500
against the white ancestor,

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.230
or one of the white evolved populations

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:45.490
against the red ancestor
and we can distinguish them.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:46.323
- [Derek] In this case,

00:09:46.323 --> 00:09:48.610
it's clear that the evolved red population

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.610
outcompeted their white ancestor.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.380
Now, to determine the winner,

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.023
all of the colonies are counted by hand.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.640
- So what was the earliest
sort of big findings

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.870
from the experiment?

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.630
- The first thing we found,

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.240
not that there was any doubt about it,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.720
but it's one of the most
direct demonstrations

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.900
of Darwinian adaptation
by natural selection,

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:09.800
you can imagine.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.620
Yes, they're getting to be
better competitors over time.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.460
It's a common observation in
other evolution experiments

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.320
that evolution in a new
environment gets off

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.010
to a rip-roaring start

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.980
and then tends to slow down over time.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.070
And so we repeated that observation

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.340
and I imagined that the longterm lines

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.490
would actually sort of
flat line at some point.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.790
And I actually thought about
stopping the experiment,

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.960
but I got wise advice from colleagues

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.710
and from my wife, Madeline,
let's keep it going.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.290
And so I agreed to that.

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.800
- [Derek] And it's good
thing he did because in 2003,

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.980
the bacteria started doing
something remarkable.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:49.080
- One of the 12 lineages
suddenly began to consume

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.540
a second carbon source, citrate,

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.770
which had been present in our medium

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.500
throughout the experiment.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.110
It's in the medium is what's
called a chelating agent

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:01.380
to bind metals in the medium.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.600
But E. coli going back to
its original definition

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.440
as a species is incapable of that.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.820
But one day we found one of
our flasks had more turbidity.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.750
I thought we probably had
a contaminant in there.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.160
Some bacterium had gotten in there

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.480
that could eat the citrate

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.177
and, therefore, had raised the turbidity.

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:20.380
We went back into the freezer
and restarted evolution.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.810
We also started checking those bacteria

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.490
to see whether they really were E. coli.

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:25.730
Yep, they were E. Coli.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:26.870
Were the really E. coli

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.790
that had come from the ancestral strain?

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.080
Yep. So we started doing genetics on it.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.250
It was very clear that one
of our bacteria lineages

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.570
had essentially I like to
say sort of woken up one day,

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:38.810
eaten the glucose,

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.610
and unlike any of the other lineages

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:43.330
discovered that there was
this nice lemony dessert,

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:44.840
and they'd begun consuming that

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.040
and getting a second source
of carbon and energy.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.820
Zack was interested in the question

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.790
of why did it take so long to evolve this

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:56.090
and has only one population
evolve that ability?

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.660
He went into the freezer

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.450
and he picked bacterial
individuals or clones

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:03.490
from that lineage that
eventually evolved that ability.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.990
And then he tried to
evolve that ability again

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.510
starting from different points.

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:10.000
So in a sense, it's almost like,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.910
well, it's like rewinding the tape

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.900
and starting let's go back to
the minute five of the movie.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.430
Let's go back to a minute 10 of the movie,

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:17.700
minute 20 of the movie

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.660
and see if the result changes
depending on when we did it,

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.500
because this citrate phenotype

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.830
there were essentially
two competing explanations

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:29.122
for why it was so difficult to evolve.

00:12:29.122 --> 00:12:31.920
One was that it was just
a really rare mutation.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.200
It wasn't like one of these
just change one letter.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.520
It was something where
maybe you had to flip

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.810
a certain segment of DNA

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:39.730
and you had to have
exactly this break point

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:41.320
and exactly that break point.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.760
And that was the only way to do it.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.540
So it was a rare event,

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.380
but it could have happened
at any point in time.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.020
The alternative hypothesis is that,

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:54.770
well, what happened was a series of events

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:58.470
that made something perfectly
ordinary become possible

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:00.500
that wasn't possible at the beginning

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.730
because a mutation would
only have this effect

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:07.380
once other aspects of
the organism had changed.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.130
To make a long story short,

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.480
it turns out it's such a
difficult trait to evolve

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.860
because both of those hypotheses are true.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.300
- [Derek] The experiment uncovered

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.850
other surprising findings.

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:19.450
Like instead of the bacteria

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.510
getting more numerous over time,

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.130
they actually decreased in number,

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:28.240
but each individual bacterium got larger.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.810
Six of the 12 populations
evolved hypermutability,

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.550
mutation rates a hundred times
higher than their ancestors,

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.890
but these populations
subsequently acquired

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:39.050
additional mutations

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.400
that brought the mutation rate back down.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.480
I mean, it's advantageous

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.250
to be able to evolve faster than others,

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.830
but if the mutation rate is too high,

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:50.340
then offspring have too
many deleterious mutations.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.060
But maybe the most
surprising finding of all

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.180
is what didn't happen.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.590
- This view I had that
they were flat lining

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:59.470
turned out to be quite false.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:03.090
I had sort of imagined a very
simple mathematical model.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.020
You can create something
called a rectangular hyperbola,

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.760
I guess, which has an initial high slope

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.950
and then reaches an asymptote,

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.410
but they're equally simple models.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.460
There's a model that also
has just two parameters

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.220
called a power law model
that says things slow down,

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.690
but it doesn't have an upper bound.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.210
It says, just keep going
for time immemorial,

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.330
and things will just keep going faster,

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.700
but at a slower and slower
rate of further improvement.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.110
And it turned out that
model actually fits our data

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:35.290
better than that original
model I had imagined.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.670
And not only does it fit it better,

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:40.460
okay, you say statistics,
science, fitting curves,

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.960
it actually predicts the future.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.410
And that's what's really cool
because the original model,

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:47.910
if you give it say just 5,000 generations

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.370
worth of our fitness data

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.650
and ask it to predict into the future,

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.850
it says the asymptote is here.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:55.570
But then when we get more data, no!

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:56.740
The bacteria are up here.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.610
They've passed that asymptote.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.090
Whereas this power law model,

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:01.520
which says things are slowing down,

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.220
but never reaching an asymptote?

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.200
We give it just 1/10 of
our data from the past

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.510
and it projects very
accurately out to 50,000

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.290
and even 60,000 generations
when we last looked.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.290
It predicts sort of the future course

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:16.090
of the evolutionary trajectory.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:17.800
And to me, that's kind of profound

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.520
and it's sort of changed the
way I look at this experiment,

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.430
and even a little bit how
I look at life on earth.

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:27.910
I mean, life on earth
doesn't stop evolving.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:28.743
We know that.

00:15:28.743 --> 00:15:29.576
And we know that,

00:15:29.576 --> 00:15:30.409
but we think that's,

00:15:30.409 --> 00:15:31.760
oh, that's because
they're asteroid impacts.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.400
That's because of human impacts.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.090
That's because they're viruses

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:36.110
that are attacking their hosts

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.823
and that the co-evolution
is causing evolution

00:15:38.823 --> 00:15:40.880
is causing evolution to never stop.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.140
The world is always changing.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.310
So of course, evolution never stops.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.950
And that is 100% true.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:49.310
But what our experiment suggests

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:53.090
is that even in the absence
of environmental change,

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:56.380
there are so many opportunities of smaller

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:59.930
and smaller magnitude to
continue to make progress

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:03.720
that, in fact, progress
probably would never stop

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.270
even in a constant environment.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:08.050
To me, it's one of the reasons

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.640
to keep this experiment going.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.660
Does this model continue
to predict the unfolding

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.373
of the future fitness trajectory?

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.570
- Okay. Now the conclusion
of the experiment

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:24.700
where I look for that fluorescent powder

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.270
using this UV torch.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:27.783
So let's hit the lights.

00:16:28.995 --> 00:16:29.880
(laughs)

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:34.620
Whoa. There is a lot of
fluorescent powder around here.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.890
Obviously there's a lot in the sink,

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:39.740
but also here on the tap,

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.863
it looks like someone wiped
down the handle and the faucet.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.773
Oh, check out the dishwasher.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.290
Yeah, and on the handle.

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:51.450
This is a great way of visualizing

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:54.950
how dishcloths can spread
bacteria around the house.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.183
What? (laughs)

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:00.113
It looks like finger marks.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:04.910
As a dad, I encounter lots of big messes

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:07.670
and sticky hands and slimy faces.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.220
So when there is a mess or spill in my kitchen

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.993
I choose to clean it up with Bounty

00:17:12.993 --> 00:17:14.863
So I wanna thank Bounty
for sponsoring this video,

00:17:14.863 --> 00:17:22.712
and I wanna thank you for watching.
