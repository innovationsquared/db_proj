00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.710
- This is the world's largest 3D metal printer.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.060
It was built by Relativity Space,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.090
a startup that aims to
print an entire rocket,

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.510
including fuel tanks and rocket
engines, in just 60 days.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.650
I'm like looking inside
a 3D printed rocket

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.970
that is actually gonna go to space.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.610
This giant hunk of
metal, it's unbelievable.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.850
This video is sponsored by Omaze.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.060
Offering you the chance
to win a trip to space.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.053
More about that at the end of the show.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.480
- There's a lot of UV
coming off the welds,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.490
you can film it, but
don't look directly at it.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.120
You get sunburned fast, so
it's like you're suiting up

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.710
to go in a volcano.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.270
All right, we're gonna
go in to the 3D printer,

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.253
and see how it works.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.050
All right, so, yep, just hold this up.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.900
Don't look at it.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.270
We are in the printer.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.810
- I can see it over there.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.658
- If we walk around here,
we can get up close.

00:00:55.658 --> 00:00:58.741
(machinery whirring)

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.300
(machinery beating)

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.040
So that's the wire melt team,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.230
and the print head moving around.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.790
So that's the plasma discharge,
and it's hard to tell,

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.150
but it's doing things every
couple of milliseconds,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.551
it's actually changing
the electric wave form,

00:01:16.551 --> 00:01:19.700
which is how it's controlling
the deposition so well.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.930
- Do you know the temperature of it?

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.533
Like, is it just above melt temp?

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.410
- It's just above melting for aluminum.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.120
Yeah, probably a few
hundred degrees above.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.930
- The melting point of aluminum
is 660 degrees Celsius.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.560
So the whole body of the rocket

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.533
is effectively melted together
one tiny bit at a time.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.480
- All the raw metal

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.200
for the whole rocket
that's printed is this.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.090
It's a, you know, we kind of joke

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.656
it's like Charlotte's web.

00:01:45.656 --> 00:01:49.463
Like a spider silk, but
this is an aluminum alloy

00:01:49.463 --> 00:01:51.600
that's on a wire spool.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.260
We actually print about
10 inches a second.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.150
So this wire is really going super fast,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.660
and then the combination of
lasers and plasma arc discharge

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.750
are working to melt both of
them together at the same time.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.810
- So where does the wire come out?

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.580
- So it's right there, and
then the electric arc discharge

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.100
happens right at the tip of the wire too.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.020
- This is a camera.
- Yeah, that's a camera.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.630
- But why would you want
to 3D print a rocket?

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.460
Is it just because we can?

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.660
It's funny to me that

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.010
you had this experience with
3D printing where you're like,

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.240
oh, 3D printing is clearly the future.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.830
Whereas, I feel like a
lot of people's experience

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.610
with 3D printers as mine has been,

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.180
it's like incredibly frustrating.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.240
I feel like 3D printing is that thing

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.850
that seems like it should be great,

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.700
and yet whenever I try it,

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.430
I don't get a result that I'm happy with.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.440
- Yeah, I know.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.550
I can tell you, we had
plenty of experiences

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.540
the first couple of years,

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.769
where we ended up with a pile
of metal and it didn't work.

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.290
- But there are actually good
reasons to 3D print a rocket.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.470
A rocket has four major systems.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.060
Payload, guidance,
structural, and propulsion.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.920
The bulk of the rocket is made
up of the propulsion system,

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.070
including the propellant
tanks and the rocket engines.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.540
Cryogenic fuel and oxidizer are pumped

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.920
through an injector into
the combustion chamber

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.760
where they react, releasing
an enormous amount of heat.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.231
This causes the exhaust gases to expand,

00:03:16.231 --> 00:03:19.600
exiting the rocket
nozzle at high velocity.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.310
The faster this exit velocity

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.940
and the higher the mass flow rate,

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.510
the more thrust that can be generated.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.070
So rockets are huge, complex
engineering projects,

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.570
which up to this point have
largely been manufactured

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.250
using traditional techniques.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.524
That means before you
can build the rocket,

00:03:35.524 --> 00:03:39.140
you first have to build the
tools to build the rocket.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.360
For example, to build
NASA's next huge rocket,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.810
the Space Launch System or SLS,

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.090
they first needed to construct

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.033
the vertical assembly center or VAC.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.740
This is a 170 foot tall
tool for welding together

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.200
the domes, rings, and barrel sections

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.350
of the rocket's fuel tanks.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.410
- They built that like an aerospace thing,

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.740
and they've had to spin up all
these custom tooling designs

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.140
and validate that those work

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.530
before actually starts
building the rocket.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.720
And they finally got one
being assembled on the pad

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.370
after 11 years of development.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.570
In contrast, Relativity Space the company,

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.091
is just five and a half years old,

00:04:15.091 --> 00:04:18.580
and they plan to launch
their first rocket this year.

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.080
- I see this as a like
old engineering style

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.342
versus Silicon valley
style of build something,

00:04:25.342 --> 00:04:27.030
figure out what's wrong with it,

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.360
and build another thing
that fixes those, right?

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.995
The differences, I've always
done that with software.

00:04:31.995 --> 00:04:35.680
These guys are doing it
with aerospace hardware.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.649
- So this is the actual
rocket tank structure

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:40.930
of what we're gonna be launching to orbit

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:41.763
at the end of this year.

00:04:41.763 --> 00:04:44.103
So this actual thing
is launching to space.

00:04:44.103 --> 00:04:45.580
- That will go to space?

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.790
- This will go to space,

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.250
and it's by far the largest
3D printed product really,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.950
of any type ever made that's gonna fly.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.830
I think maybe of any type in the world.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.170
- But it still looks 3D printed.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.580
Like you can still see the layers.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.910
- Yeah, yeah, you can
still see the layers.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.600
It only adds an extra
5 to 10% of the mass

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.860
with the roughness.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.030
When you actually cross
section the material

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.070
and look at the machine parts of it,

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.360
it looks like normal metal.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.080
Like actually at this end,
this is printed as well.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.160
We just machine it afterwards.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.360
So it looks like normal
metal in the joint sections.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.520
- Does the surface roughness
cause any aerodynamic problems?

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.640
- No, none at all.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.560
Yeah, it's actually the
exact same aerodynamically.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.000
This whole thing, we simulate
the print before printing,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.060
because if you just printed,
you know, the 3D file

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.730
and said press print, you
would end up with a printer

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.270
that's warped and like material
falling all over the place

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.700
that wouldn't actually work.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.860
So we've invented software
that reverse warps

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.980
the whole part before printing it.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.700
So the robots are actually doing this

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.822
really wobbly, weird shape,

00:05:49.822 --> 00:05:52.860
but then it's actually perfectly straight

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.270
within a human hair at the entire length.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.250
- As it cools
- As it cools.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.650
The warpy thing turns into the...

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.070
- And then we simulate all of that.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.514
So it's a big computational solver

00:06:04.514 --> 00:06:08.250
that simulates it, and there's
many, many other problems

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.120
we've had to solve to actually get

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.430
printing a rocket to work.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.340
But it's all these little pieces

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.664
over the last couple of years,

00:06:14.664 --> 00:06:17.470
and we've really started
to hit some breakthroughs,

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.770
which is also why now
you see a whole rocket.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.230
Yeah, you can step up here actually

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.063
if you want.
- Can I?

00:06:23.063 --> 00:06:23.896
- Yeah, yeah.

00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:27.420
(man laughs)

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.490
- Hello.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.650
I'm like looking inside
a 3D printed rocket

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:32.980
that is actually gonna go to space.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:33.877
- Yes.

00:06:33.877 --> 00:06:35.850
- This giant hunk of metal.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.033
It's unbelievable.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.280
There's like rings inside.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.250
- Those are printed in stiffeners.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.400
And so those help prevent the rocket

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.010
from buckling and crumpling.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.600
So if you had a Coke can,
and didn't pop the tab,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.260
if you try to step on it,
it's almost impossible

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.700
because there's pressure inside

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.980
that keeps it from buckling.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.240
But then when you pop the tab,

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.920
there's no pressure and you
can crunch it super easy.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.100
It's not hard at all.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.340
So rockets are the same.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.550
The 50 PSI of pressure,

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.706
which is about the same as a car tire,

00:07:07.706 --> 00:07:10.940
keeps it inflated and
keeps it from crumpling,

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.320
but then the stiffeners
also help keep it rigid.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.440
- Yeah, so believe it or not,

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.250
a rocket tank is thinner
versus its diameter

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.280
than a Coke can.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.050
So when you look at a Coke can,

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.890
you know how big it is
and then how thin it is,

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.010
a rocket tank is actually
thinner than that.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.660
So yeah, it's pretty light.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:28.700
It has to be very light.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.570
- Sure.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.360
Aerospace companies started
using metal 3D printing

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.410
over a decade ago to
construct small complex parts.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.280
For example, the injector.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.720
- That is the most important
part of any rocket engine,

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.093
where you basically gotta
take the liquid propellant,

00:07:42.093 --> 00:07:46.800
and turn it into a fine mist
that mixes really rapidly.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.170
And those have actually been transitioned

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.890
to 3D printing all over the industry.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:53.700
- Traditionally, something like this,

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.590
it's a bucket engine injector.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.040
So it mixes liquid oxygen

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.460
and liquid methane propellants together,

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.170
and this is what actually
produces all the fire and flame

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.470
that is in a rocket engine.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.869
Traditionally, it would be over
a thousand individual pieces

00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:08.970
and it would take nine months,

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.120
but here we're 3D printing
the whole thing in one piece.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.420
It takes two weeks and
it costs 10 times less.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.270
- One of the big benefits of 3D printing

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.590
is reducing the number of parts.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:20.530
Have you ever thought about

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.380
how inside a rockets combustion
chamber, it gets really hot.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.010
Up to 3,500 Kelvin.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:30.150
That's hot enough to
melt virtually any metal.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:34.230
So how do the combustion chamber
and rocket nozzle not melt?

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.530
The answer is they're cooled by passing

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.030
the cryogenic propellants over them.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:40.590
- On the Space Shuttle main engines.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:43.590
I love to talk about them
because inside those engines,

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:46.000
it's hot enough to boil iron.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.710
On the outside, you can freeze stuff

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.883
to the exterior of this
because you're running liquid

00:08:51.883 --> 00:08:54.280
hydrogen through these things.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.210
But to make those,

00:08:55.210 --> 00:09:00.150
you basically had to take
thousands of very small pipes,

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.380
and then you would form them

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.520
into the shape of the combustion
chamber and the nozzle,

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.510
and then you would braze
weld them together.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.940
And this was a ridiculously
labor-intensive task.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:14.200
You would have 1,080 individual
pipes running up the side,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.310
all having to be weld together

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:18.540
to make the combustion
chamber and the nozzle

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.650
on the Space Shuttle engines.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.760
So you can actually 3D print these things.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.300
- This is a rocket
nozzle being 3D printed,

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.880
and you can see the channels
for the cryogenic propellants

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.100
being printed right into the single part

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.990
instead of having to add a
thousand pipes on the outside.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.510
Smaller parts like these
are typically 3D printed

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.030
using metal powder and lasers.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.560
- So you can see the cooling channels

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.978
are all being built as the one piece.

00:09:43.978 --> 00:09:45.720
So this is a nozzle.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.350
It really just lays down a layer of powder

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.330
that's about a 20th the
thickness of a human hair.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.258
So it's really, really fine layers

00:09:54.258 --> 00:09:57.690
just over and over and
over and over relentlessly

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:59.820
for probably about a week or so,

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.660
and then out comes the rocket nozzle

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.630
all printed as one piece.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.550
It's way cheaper than traditional.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.890
And this has four lasers going at once.

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.060
- That's amazing.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.100
- I get asked a lot, well,
aren't 3D printed metals

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.200
not very strong?

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.180
Or how can it actually work?

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.750
But the printed materials are stronger

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.960
than they would be built
traditionally, actually.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.090
It's counterintuitive.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:21.923
- It is.

00:10:21.923 --> 00:10:24.860
- Because we develop our
own custom alloys in house.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.360
So we have a whole material science team

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.990
just developing our own
alloys for 3D printing,

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:33.070
and the fact that it melts
and then cools and solidifies

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.430
very, very quickly, you can take advantage

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:39.640
of that physics principle
to get really strong alloys.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.260
- Another major benefit of 3D printing

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.580
is that it allows for rapid iteration.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.870
You can build a part quickly, test it,

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.900
and then redesign rapidly and print again.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.280
- So this is a version of the engine

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.400
that's about three
years old at this point,

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.940
but what's amazing is
when you actually look

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.430
at the engine design today,

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.440
it looks entirely different than this.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.060
So each version we build, we
can iterate and make better.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.750
So that's the other, you know,

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.590
when we say software driven manufacturing,

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:07.050
that's really what it is.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:08.870
Since you don't have fixed tooling,

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:11.170
all the part geometries
are just controlled

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.801
via the CAD model, and then
the printers just print

00:11:13.801 --> 00:11:16.270
direct from file essentially.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:19.500
It means you can actually change
the design extremely fast.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.420
So building a whole engine
only takes us about a month.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.610
So then a month later, you
can do a better version,

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.622
and a month later, a
better version than that.

00:11:26.622 --> 00:11:29.600
So this particular one will actually be,

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.890
I believe one of the first flight engines

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:35.720
that's actually launching to
orbit on our first rocket.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.170
- So this tubing, not 3D printed, right?

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:40.200
- Not today.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.033
- Okay.

00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:44.500
- In the future versions,
we're actually integrating that

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.931
into the printed housings.

00:11:46.931 --> 00:11:48.430
And we're gonna have a way
that that's all printed too.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:49.850
- Perhaps the biggest impact

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.830
of the 3D printing approach
could be to totally transform

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:54.200
what a rocket looks like.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.360
With 3D printing,
engineers can build parts

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.840
that would be impractical or impossible

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.460
with traditional techniques.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.207
Smooth, curvy, bio-inspired designs

00:12:03.207 --> 00:12:06.290
are just as easy to print
as ordinary structures.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:09.660
- This is actually part of
our next rocket, Terran R.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.360
So it's even larger.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.190
- This is like the base of a tank.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:14.050
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.180
So it's gonna go out.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.580
It's almost done printing.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.733
It's gonna go out about to here.

00:12:17.733 --> 00:12:21.502
So it's 16 foot diameter,
but it's almost like a shell.

00:12:21.502 --> 00:12:24.460
- I was gonna say like,
this reminds me of suddenly

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.820
we're in The Little Mermaid or something.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.220
- Yeah, yeah.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.490
Yeah, it's just for stiffness though.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.550
- It's not that you plan
to make it bio inspired.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:34.150
It's like that structure is
actually the optimal structure.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.690
- Yeah, yeah.

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.390
- We're actually designing
many features in the rocket

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:42.000
that could not be manufactured
unless it was 3D printed,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.100
which is one of the secret sauces

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.970
of why you had to build a
whole company around it,

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:48.400
is because our rocket actually looks

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.610
entirely different 3D printed
than it does traditionally.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.670
Like in my mind, it's been more akin

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:57.280
to like gas internal
combustion engine to electric.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.880
You know, really, people
are trying to put batteries

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.800
and electric motors into
existing products for decades.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.080
Like everyone knew electric
vehicles were the future,

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.226
but Nissan and Ford had
really not compelling products

00:13:09.226 --> 00:13:10.750
for a long time.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:14.460
It wasn't until a company
came along called Tesla

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.390
that decided, well, actually
the shift to electrification

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:21.100
means the batteries, the
electric motors, the factory,

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.420
the design of the product,

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.240
how we're actually
gonna scale the company,

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.240
the supply chain, all of it's different

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.620
because of electrification.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.940
I mean, that's in some ways,

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.840
the dirty secret of electric cars

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.420
and why they're able to
be automated in production

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.700
because the part count is so much lower.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.360
So for a fully 3D printed rocket,

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.270
we have a hundred times fewer parts,

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:41.150
which is what we're guiding to.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:44.487
There's no fixed tooling
in our factory at all.

00:13:44.487 --> 00:13:46.580
Unlike the rest of aerospace

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.450
that's still really, 60 years later,

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.300
even since Apollo building products

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.840
one at a time by hand
with hundreds of thousands

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.920
to millions of individual parts.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.310
And no one's really changed that paradigm

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.825
of how an aerospace factory
actually fundamentally works.

00:14:00.825 --> 00:14:04.195
- Yeah, this is the new
fully 3D printed rocket.

00:14:04.195 --> 00:14:07.750
So yeah, we'll have dragon
fly wing type structures

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:08.920
and we're building it so.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.950
But that's the first one,

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.340
and then that's that one for scale.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.660
So yeah, it is definitely bigger.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:20.210
Yeah, so our rocket is named
Terran One and Terran R,

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:21.838
and then our 3D printer's Stargate.

00:14:21.838 --> 00:14:23.650
So all the things here at Relativity

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:25.666
are named after StarCraft.

00:14:25.666 --> 00:14:29.050
So yeah, of course, the Stargate printer

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:32.030
was with the Protoss
used to warp in spaceships.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:35.521
And so, that's what's warping
in spaceships at Relativity.

00:14:35.521 --> 00:14:38.980
We have a system in our
avionics called the Pylon

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.150
that we have to build a lot of.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:43.360
So we always joke, we have to
construct additional Pylons.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.496
Most people don't know how rockets

00:14:45.496 --> 00:14:48.950
are built traditionally at all anyway.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.180
And I think a lot of
people assume it's rockets,

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:54.360
so shouldn't it be already very advanced

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.540
and robots everywhere and you know,

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.540
Elon's got Space X and Tesla,

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.760
so doesn't Space X just look like Tesla

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.798
with all these robots and automation?

00:15:02.798 --> 00:15:04.340
But that's really not true.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.157
I mean, aerospace hasn't
adopted automation at all.

00:15:07.157 --> 00:15:09.850
- One of the issues, right,
is that you're not making

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:11.260
a lot of rockets?

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.093
- Right?

00:15:12.093 --> 00:15:14.810
- So there's no incentive
to like figure out

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.280
how to tool up a factory
to like pump out rockets

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.590
like a hundred a day or something.

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:19.423
- Exactly.

00:15:19.423 --> 00:15:20.256
- Like you would for cars.

00:15:20.256 --> 00:15:21.540
- Exactly, you're not making a lot.

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:22.980
Even with commercial aircraft,

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.450
you're not making nearly as many

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.770
and there's orders of magnitude
more parts and complexity.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:32.290
A commercial aircraft has
several million individual parts.

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:35.234
So to have robots assemble
several million parts

00:15:35.234 --> 00:15:38.830
when an automobile has tens of thousands

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:40.250
is completely different.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:41.780
It's a much harder problem.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.230
So that's where 3D printing
is automation for aerospace

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:48.340
because you're not assembling
all those parts with robots

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.030
like you would with a car,

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:52.600
you're assembling them in the 3D file

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.450
and then the printer just
prints them assembled.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:58.660
- The plan for Relativity Space,

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:01.320
is it low-earth orbit or is
it going further than that?

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.870
- So for Terran One, it's
mostly low earth orbit.

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:05.204
The first rocket.

00:16:05.204 --> 00:16:08.560
Terran R can actually send
payload to the moon to Mars.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.350
I mean, it's pretty, pretty huge.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.750
I founded the company
because I really thought

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:14.420
that there needed to be, you know,

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.870
dozens of hundreds of
companies making Mars happen.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.460
We're focused on taking
this 3D printing tech

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.620
and what we call the
factory of the future,

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.418
and one day shrinking it down to something

00:16:23.418 --> 00:16:26.350
we'll actually launch to Mars
and build an industrial base.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.580
So that's the long-term
vision of the company,

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.640
is build the industrial base on Mars.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.050
In many ways, this factory
is just a prototype.

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.120
It's still far smaller
than a traditional factory.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.220
It's far lighter.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.220
And I think it's inevitable

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.270
someone has to build this company.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.140
- I don't know that in 10, 20 years

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.220
that you will be 3D printing
rockets all the time.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.440
Because if you are flying lots of rockets,

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.840
it becomes cheaper to have
a dedicated machine for it.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:52.851
I do think that as a
company, they are well-placed

00:16:52.851 --> 00:16:57.440
because even if Terran fails
to capitalize on the market,

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.040
even if nobody wants to
use it as a launch vehicle,

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.840
they are clearly now the world experts

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.680
on 3D printing rocket hardware,

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.570
'cause they've done everything, right?

00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:08.520
They've tried to apply
3D printing to places

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.970
where a lot of people dismissed it.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.950
So I think they're sort
of secure as a company.

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:18.000
Whether we will see rockets
being 3D printed all the time?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.903
That's a good question.

00:17:19.903 --> 00:17:21.270
- There've been a lot of talk recently

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.580
about billionaires going to space.

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:24.670
- Yeah.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:27.138
- Will a 3D printed
rocket make it possible

00:17:27.138 --> 00:17:31.180
and a lot cheaper for me to go to space?

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.330
- Yes, I mean, certainly what we're doing

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:34.720
is lowering the cost.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.800
So our rockets are
costing about five times

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.260
to, you know, I believe we can get to 10

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.980
or even a hundred times cheaper

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:48.000
with a fully reusable rocket
than what we have today.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.687
So it can definitely
climb down the cost curve.

00:17:50.687 --> 00:17:52.966
But I also think, you know, going to Mars

00:17:52.966 --> 00:17:55.192
and the first people that are going,

00:17:55.192 --> 00:17:57.986
it really is about what is the
point of being a human being?

00:17:57.986 --> 00:18:00.000
Like for me, why go to Mars?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.919
If we were having this conversation

00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:05.009
and a million people were
living on another planet,

00:18:05.009 --> 00:18:07.046
I think it would expand the possibilities

00:18:07.046 --> 00:18:10.114
of human experience and what
it means to be a person.

00:18:10.114 --> 00:18:12.915
Like we'd have YouTube channels on Mars

00:18:12.915 --> 00:18:16.003
and people sharing what life
on Mars is like versus earth.

00:18:16.003 --> 00:18:18.692
And there'd be long distance
Amelie, like love stories.

00:18:18.692 --> 00:18:21.249
Like I think there's
just a lot of richness

00:18:21.249 --> 00:18:25.332
in what human culture
and society can be about.

00:18:25.332 --> 00:18:27.507
Yes, I think there's criticism about,

00:18:27.507 --> 00:18:29.485
you know, billionaires going to space

00:18:29.485 --> 00:18:31.306
and I don't agree with.

00:18:31.306 --> 00:18:32.945
You know, all of the projects

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:35.350
need to actually add up to
some vision that is meaningful.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:38.023
I think that's really important.

00:18:38.023 --> 00:18:40.926
But I do think going to
Mars is really just about,

00:18:40.926 --> 00:18:42.972
you know, we've lived
for generations on earth,

00:18:42.972 --> 00:18:44.966
so what's it all about like,

00:18:44.966 --> 00:18:48.660
why do we want to keep
improving and getting better

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.933
and furthering society on earth?

00:18:50.933 --> 00:18:52.689
So for me, it's pretty existential.

00:18:52.689 --> 00:18:54.632
What it means to be a human being.

00:18:54.796 --> 00:18:57.963
(techy sound effect)

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.710
