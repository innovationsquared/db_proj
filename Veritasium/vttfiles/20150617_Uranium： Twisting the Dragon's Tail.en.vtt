00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:08.540
Did you know that after the 1986 Chernobyl
nuclear disaster at reactor number four, that

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.940
the other reactors on that site were not shut
down permanently?

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.150
In fact, they were kept running, producing
electricity by workers who were brought in

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.370
by train every day to work on those other
reactors, the last of which was shut down

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.619
around the year 2000.

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.730
That is just one of the many surprising facts
I found out while shooting a documentary for

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.780
TV which is called Uranium: Twisting the Dragon’s
Tail.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.690
Now while we were shooting this documentary
I would take out my little camera and shot

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.570
small pieces while they were setting up the
big camera.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.430
This is James.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.789
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:46.160
&gt;&gt; But that has allowed me to make some YouTube
videos for you, including the most radioactive

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.160
places on earth.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.199
And I will have a few more of those videos
coming out very soon.

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.920
But what I wanted to show you was the trailer
for this documentary.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.039
I want you guys to check out this trailer.

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.220
Let me know what you think and I will put
at the end of the trailer the dates that this

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.980
documentary will be aired in your area.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.410
It will be played in the US and Australia
and in Europe.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.470
So stay tuned to the end of this trailer to
check out when it will be on in your neck

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.680
of the woods.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.970
So thank you guys so much for watching this
YouTube channel, because without it, I never

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.460
would have got the job hosting this TV documentary.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.530
And I really hope you enjoy it.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.530
We put so much work into it and it looks amazing.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.590
So check it out.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.410
Here it is.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:35.210
Legends say there is a world beneath this
one where a dragon lies sleeping.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:47.230
They say: Be careful how you wake the dragon.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.800
Around the turn of the 20th century Uranium
is almost unknown.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.170
It is basically worthless.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.210
But then in 40 years, just a single generation,
it becomes the most desirable and terrifying

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.790
rock on earth.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.550
This is uranium.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.019
And as a physicist, I am fascinated by its
unique scientific properties.

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:16.560
But even more so by how this one rock has
shaped the entire modern world.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:24.090
Uranium changes everything.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.930
Uranium makes the modern world.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.569
Uranium is a dream.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.760
Clean, limitless power.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.629
Or a nightmare of a silent and poisoned earth.

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.109
&gt;&gt; Oh, it is hot.

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:38.590
It is hot here.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.069
It is really hot.

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.069
&gt;&gt; It’s overloaded.

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:47.340
&gt;&gt; Come with me on a journey to find the most
desirable...

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.530
&gt;&gt; This is a nuclear reactor.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.549
&gt;&gt; And the most hated rock on earth.

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:56.849
&gt;&gt; It is just that fear.

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.159
If it blows, what is going to happen to it?

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:04.379
&gt;&gt; How did we unleash the elemental force
within uranium?

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.769
What happened when we woke the dragon?

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.419
&gt;&gt; This is the story of how a rock changed
the world.
