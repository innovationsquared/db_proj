00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.970
Have you ever noticed how badly people behave
when they are collecting their luggage at

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.000
the airport?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.020
I mean they all cluster right up against the
carousel so people behind them can’t see

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.020
their bags.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.509
And then when you do spot your bag, you have
to push through all the other passengers to

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.580
collect it and usually bump into them as you
are grabbing your bag off the carousel.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.539
Why is it that people behave so badly?

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.470
It doesn’t seem to matter which airport
you go to anywhere in the world.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.080
The problem is the same.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.330
And this problem, believe it or not, is related
to why trees are tall.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.820
Go with me on this.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.800
So why are trees this tall?

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.440
I mean some of them are over 115 meters.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.600
They are the largest organisms on the planet.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.160
And you might think that they are this tall
so that they can capture sunlight.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.110
And to a degree that is true.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.900
But anyone who has ever walked through a mature
forest knows that the lower part of a tree

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.330
has basically no branches and leaves.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.870
And that makes sense, because not enough light
filters down through the top most branches

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.530
to make it worth having sun capturing apparatus
down here.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.580
Over millennia trees have evolved to put their
energy where it yields returns, that is, in

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.339
the canopy and not where it doesn’t.

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.670
But this then begs the question: Why put all
this energy into building a trunk that is

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.240
10 or 20 meters if you are never intending
to use this vertical space to capture sunlight?

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.850
I mean, it costs energy to make this trunk.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.930
Plus it makes it harder to transport water
from the roots up to the topmost branches

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.870
and it makes the tree more susceptible to
water stress.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.210
So it is in every individual tree’s best
interest to be shorter, to not have this gigantic

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.140
trunk and to use the conserved energy to improve
its seeds and its branches, to put its energy

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.140
where it pays a return.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.970
But, of course, if there was a mutation that
allowed a tree to do this, you know what would

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.060
happen to it.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.120
In a forest surrounded by all these taller
trees, it would be shaded from the sun and

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.570
so it would wither and die.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.510
But what if all of the trees developed the
same mutation?

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.090
What if they all created a friendship pact,
a forest of friendship in which everyone agreed

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.130
not to grow such a big trunk, to star the
leaves right at the ground?

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.570
Well, that would mean every individual tree
would be better off.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.340
The trouble is this solution is not stable,
because any tiny mutation that results in

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.450
a tree that is slightly taller would advantage
that tree.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.490
It would be able to capture more light and
it would shade its neighbors.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.150
And so pretty soon it would have more offspring.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.480
It would come to dominate the forest.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.470
And then any additional mutation down then
line would result in even taller trees.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.950
This is how trees got so tall.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.090
I mean, they would keep getting taller until
the cost of going one more foot is exactly

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.980
equal to benefits of collecting that additional
sunlight.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.930
And that is why trees are as tall as they
are today.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.750
I mean, it is not an optimal solution.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.680
It is not like these trees have the best use
of their energy.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.590
But it is the one that is stable.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.660
So the point is: Although it is in every tree’s
best interest to be a part of this forest

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.930
of friendship, it will never work.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.540
It will never last, because any individual
who gets a little bit taller is going to ruin

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.160
it for everyone.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.569
And it is the very same thing when you go
to collect your bags.

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.850
I mean, if everyone could agree to stand a
couple of meters away from the carousel, everyone

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.130
would have a good view of their bags and be
able to easily step forward and collect their

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.130
luggage.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.770
But, of course, one person standing forward
is going to block the view of behind them.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.340
So everyone is going to rush forward.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.569
It is an unstable solution, just like a forest
of friendship.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:23.739
So remember.

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.780
Next time you are frustrated collecting your
bags at the airport, remember.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.960
Trees know just how you feel.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:45.200
&gt;&gt; I have summarized the whole problem for
you here.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.510
Are you ready?
