00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.785
If you drop a slinky

00:00:01.785 --> 00:00:03.474
dangling under its own weight,

00:00:03.474 --> 00:00:04.926
the bottom won't start falling

00:00:04.926 --> 00:00:07.422
until the whole slinky has collapsed.

00:00:07.422 --> 00:00:08.199
This is because

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:09.266
each coil is stretched

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.153
to support the weight

00:00:10.153 --> 00:00:12.070
of everything beneath it.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.793
So in order for one coil to fall,

00:00:13.793 --> 00:00:15.586
it needs the coil above it to collapse

00:00:15.586 --> 00:00:17.811
and so on all the way up to the top.

00:00:17.811 --> 00:00:19.257
It's like a row of dominoes

00:00:19.257 --> 00:00:21.076
where the tension released at the top

00:00:21.076 --> 00:00:22.617
cascades down the slinky

00:00:22.617 --> 00:00:24.617
and this takes some time.

00:00:26.177 --> 00:00:28.394
This is the longest slinky I had access to

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:29.927
and what's cool about this angle

00:00:29.927 --> 00:00:32.255
is you can see the bottom starts to rotate

00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:33.546
right there.

00:00:33.546 --> 00:00:34.920
Meaning there is a twisting wave

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.099
that travels through the slinky

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:37.857
faster than the compression wave.

00:00:37.857 --> 00:00:38.853
The bottom is turning

00:00:38.853 --> 00:00:39.988
but still not falling

00:00:39.988 --> 00:00:41.641
until the top crashes into it.
