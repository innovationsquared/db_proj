00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.596
This is a robot that walks,

00:00:02.596 --> 00:00:04.460
flies, 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.975
skateboards,

00:00:05.975 --> 00:00:07.820
and slacklines. 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.708
But why?

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.460
A portion of this video was sponsored by Bluehost.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.240
More about them at the end of the show.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.520
There are lots of
bipedal robots out there,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.890
and drones are ubiquitous.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.520
But until now, no one had engineered

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.930
walking and flying
technology to work together

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.260
in a single robot.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.940
- So it's the first robot
that truly integrates

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.390
the walking and the flying.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.680
It's not just a drone with legs.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.470
- [Dr. Chung] It's
LEONARDO and it stands for

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.840
LEgs ONboARD drOne.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.340
So I think it's a pretty good name.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.670
- [Derek] Why is this potentially useful?

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.630
- Yeah, so any flying vehicles

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.960
actually have to start from
the ground to take off.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.840
And eventually, they can
not stay in the air forever.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.550
They have to eventually come down.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.130
But sometimes they have to come down

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.700
on the very challenging
terrain or some obstacles.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.660
So it's actually a good idea to have

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.309
these controlLable legs.

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:02.320
So they can actually land

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.210
in a very interesting configuration,

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.660
or posture, or orientation.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.630
- [Derek] But there are
additional benefits.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.950
A robot like this is more
stable than a regular drone.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.780
- I view these propellers
almost like arms.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.960
So some people might say that,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.890
oh, you guys are cheating because I mean,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.080
bipedal robots do not have propellers,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.070
but we are essentially
using the propellers

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.053
to do additional stabilization.

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.916
(robot whirring)

00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:34.840
So basically, you generate
the lift or thruster force

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.770
to cancel some of the
the weight of the robot,

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.760
but that's really a secondary factor.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.410
The most important thing is basically

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.971
posture or orientation, stabilization.

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:47.721
(robot whirring)

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.720
- [Derek] That is so cool to see.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.350
- So the main facility for this lab

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.570
is this one.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.930
It's a gigantic fan array.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.320
- [Derek] I can see all the fans now.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.130
- [Dr. Chung] Yeah, we have
- you can start counting,

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.260
but 1,296 computer fans.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.110
Those are really literally computer fans.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.340
- [Derek] How fast can it generate wind?

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.600
- So up to 15 meters per
second or 20 meters per second.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.433
- [Derek] It's like a wind tunnel

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:14.650
without the need for a tunnel.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.483
- Yes.

00:02:15.483 --> 00:02:17.530
- It might mess with our
audio or with our microphones.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.100
Whoa.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.550
- The idea of the smoke machines

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.970
is to actually visualize the flow,

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.140
but also with all these
additional sensors,

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.760
like infrared cameras or radar and LIDAR,

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.064
how we can actually figure
out the kind of location

00:02:30.064 --> 00:02:32.680
or environment around your vehicle

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.000
in the presence of this fog.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.842
- [Derek] I wanted to feel
their power for myself.

00:02:38.842 --> 00:02:40.124
- [Man] All right, you ready?

00:02:40.124 --> 00:02:43.132
- [Derek] Yeah, let's do it.

00:02:43.132 --> 00:02:46.632
(machine whirring loudly)

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.920
Yeah!

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.520
That was so cool.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.170
I love it.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.420
They use this facility to test Leonardo

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.903
to see how stable he is even
in different wind conditions.

00:03:05.543 --> 00:03:09.376
(orchestral music)

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.700
- And we showed that Leo
is more robust than a drone

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.461
because a drone gets
blown away by the wind.

00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:24.450
But then Leo does not because
of its ground contact.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.357
So for example, if you go
hiking and there's like,

00:03:26.357 --> 00:03:28.970
suddenly a lot of wind,
you're not gonna fall

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.660
because you have the ground contact.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.860
But for a drone, it might be blown away.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.693
(gentle soft orchestra music)

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:50.310
(robot whirring)

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.143
- [Man] Oh no.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.757
- So we actually took
one of the whiteboards

00:03:56.757 --> 00:03:59.430
that we have at home and we put oil.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.460
So we applied perturbations to Leo,

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.215
and what's happening is as you
push Leo, instead of falling,

00:04:05.215 --> 00:04:09.770
it stays upright, but it also
slides on the white board.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.340
So that's an interesting capability.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.680
So it's very robust.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.920
- You said perturbations.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.780
Are you poking the robot?

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.270
- Yes, without harming the robot.

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.656
We are gentle.

00:04:18.656 --> 00:04:21.010
(robot whirring)

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.510
- LEONARDO is so stable and
good at adjusting its balance,

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.973
that it can skateboard.

00:04:27.013 --> 00:04:29.763
(robot whirring)

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.490
That's a fancy trick.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.940
Not many people can go
backwards on a skateboard.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.647
How did you get the idea for
a robot that will skateboard?

00:04:43.647 --> 00:04:46.470
- Should I say the truth
or make a nice story?

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.600
- [Derek] Tell us the truth.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.075
- Yeah, so we went hiking and we saw

00:04:50.075 --> 00:04:53.690
about 10 people going down
the mountain on a skateboard.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.265
And then we thought,
wow, this is really cool.

00:04:55.265 --> 00:04:58.191
What if we try our robots
to make it do this?

00:04:58.191 --> 00:05:01.630
So we went to the first shop
and we bought a skateboard.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.320
We modified it and we
tried it and it worked.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.473
- [Derek] So do you
think it allows the robot

00:05:05.473 --> 00:05:08.090
to save energy by riding on a skateboard?

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.580
- It's more efficient because
it uses the legs less.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.318
The legs are basically used to steer,

00:05:13.318 --> 00:05:15.090
and then it's just the propellors

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.060
that are used to accelerate the skateboard

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.900
forward and backwards.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.190
So yeah, it makes it
save a bit more energy.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.150
- The propellors of
course, make it possible

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.707
to skateboard backwards.

00:05:24.707 --> 00:05:27.120
Something I struggled with.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.897
It definitely would help
if I had a propeller.

00:05:29.897 --> 00:05:32.814
(woman chattering)

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.764
But the real challenge was slacklining.

00:05:36.764 --> 00:05:40.431
(upbeat latino dance music)

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.450
This looks incredibly unstable.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.470
So I think this proves
the point of just like,

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.610
how important control systems are.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.853
You can tell from the footage
I have no idea what I'm doing.

00:05:54.898 --> 00:05:56.740
(Derek shrieks)

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.570
All right, I thought I would
be slightly better at that.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.920
Let's give it another shot.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.073
Okay.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.373
Can anyone slackline?

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.070
Oh!

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.500
This is impossible.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.736
I need a robot to do this for me.

00:06:16.736 --> 00:06:20.403
(upbeat latino dance music)

00:06:22.717 --> 00:06:25.467
(robot whirring)

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.383
I like the sidestepping technique.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.060
Maybe I should have been doing that.

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:39.389
Kind of like copy his technique.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.694
I tried to get some tips
by watching Leonardo.

00:06:48.694 --> 00:06:51.444
(robot whirring)

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.333
But improvement was negligible.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.030
I should've prepared.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.610
You might think it's
cheating to use propellers,

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.350
but the robot is clearly not flying.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.870
It is supporting itself
mostly using the rope,

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.870
and it's able to stabilize itself

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.583
even with the wild bouncing.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.890
- So human professional slack liner,

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:20.850
you can see some of their videos,

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.667
actually they use arms stretched

00:07:22.667 --> 00:07:24.648
and then they can balance themselves.

00:07:24.648 --> 00:07:27.100
We don't have the arms for LEO yet.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.220
We are planning to add a manipulation

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.630
so that he can actually carry some object.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.100
But in the meantime, we
are using the propellers

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.470
to stabilize LEO while he's actually

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.120
walking on a slackline.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.960
- It's funny because
like the robot feels like

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.433
it's got kind of a personality to it.

00:07:42.433 --> 00:07:45.260
The way it walks and flies.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.706
It's just totally something
you're not used to seeing.

00:07:47.706 --> 00:07:48.680
- It looks natural.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.100
Actually, I have to say that the sensors

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.500
are sampled at 1,000 times per second,

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.665
but the controller is
actually being recomputed

00:07:56.665 --> 00:07:58.160
whatever signal you are sending

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.840
to propellers and the leg
joints is 200 times per second.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.350
So it's pretty fast computation.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:07.650
- [Derek] 200 times a second
it is adjusting what it's doing

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:08.580
to maintain balance?

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.020
- Yes, especially
propeller control signal.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.030
- How does that compare to humans?

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:14.280
- Oh, humans.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.440
So humans can do very sophisticated tasks,

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.210
but in terms of a fast reaction,
it's a very crude machine.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:25.490
So humans, overall, has
a few seconds of delay.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:26.330
Time delay.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.190
- Is this why I was
struggling on the slackline?

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.270
- Maybe, but... (chuckles)

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.435
- [Derek] How do you feel about
the performance here today?

00:08:32.435 --> 00:08:33.646
- Yeah, I think it beat you.

00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:35.116
(Derek laughs)

00:08:35.116 --> 00:08:36.500
- I mean, not that that's hard,

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.380
but this is very impressive.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.300
If you imagine a robot like
LEONARDO in the future,

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.283
like the greatest LEONARDO you could make,

00:08:44.283 --> 00:08:48.160
what would that robot look like and do?

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.890
- So definitely having a
LEO-like robot in space,

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.370
that would be amazing.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.420
But of course, depending on where you go,

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.083
you might not be able to use propellers.

00:08:57.083 --> 00:08:59.660
So then you would need to use thrusters.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.493
- So eventually, yes.

00:09:00.493 --> 00:09:04.570
We want to develop this
leg-based adaptive landing gear,

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.569
and then we give that to next
generation Mars helicopter,

00:09:07.569 --> 00:09:10.260
or next generation flying cars

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.179
so that it can actually land

00:09:12.179 --> 00:09:14.560
in very challenging conditions.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.601
- And still move around once-

00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:17.350
- And then once, yeah, once you land,

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.486
then you can walk over.

00:09:18.486 --> 00:09:22.000
(robot whirring)

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.990
- Imagine if you have a cliff
and then you have the robot

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:28.933
just jump out of the cliff,
deploy the propellers and fly.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.958
- [Derek] That'd be wild.

00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.125
(quirky sound effect)

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.520
Oh, hey there.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.400
This portion of the video
was sponsored by Bluehost.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.870
You know, tech is now so advanced

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.650
that robots can skateboard.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.980
So why is it still so
hard to build a website?

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.014
Make the process simple with Bluehost.

00:09:49.014 --> 00:09:51.000
It's easier than ever to get started.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.540
Bluehost provides you with
a completely free domain

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.040
for the first year, as well
as quick start templates.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.780
So you can have a beautiful website

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.440
up and running in just minutes.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.430
The templates are mobile ready
so your website is optimized

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.550
for both phones and
computers from the start.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.560
Unlike the process of
building a robot like LEO,

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.540
you don't need code in
order to make your website.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.410
Bluehost lets you customize everything

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.220
with simple drag and drop editing.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.440
And Bluehost builder also allows people

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.770
to choose their own editing journey.

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:19.960
It's built on WordPress.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.620
So at any time you can toggle
between WordPress core,

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.520
the traditional editing experience,

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.640
and the Bluehost builder
with no loss of functionality.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.610
This is a first of its
kind builder experience.

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:33.300
