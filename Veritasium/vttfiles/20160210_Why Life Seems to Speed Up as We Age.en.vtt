00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.020
I remember when I was a kid waiting an hour for my favorite TV show to come on,

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.740
which was Sharon, Lois &amp; Bram.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.340
That felt like eternity, but as I've gotten older, everything seems to have sped up.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.740
Time is going much faster. That's something virtually everyone agrees upon.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.820
"Yeah, I feel like- I feel like it does."

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.180
"Oh man, so much."

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.180
"Each year sort of gets faster and faster."

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.620
But why is this? Is it just an illusion or are there good scientific reasons why time appears to go faster

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.660
as we get older?

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.740
Well, I'm working with the National Geographic Channel's Brain Games, a show that explores

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.400
the inner workings of the human mind through experiments and interactive games to test out some

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.580
theories about why this actually occurs.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.600
There is a reasonable sounding argument that says each year goes faster because it makes up a smaller fraction

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.960
of your entire life.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:56.040
"Let's say I was only 20. One year is only 1/20th of my age. But when I'm 67, one year is 1/67th of my age."

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.360
This graph shows one year as a percentage of your life at each age.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.300
But what I find weird about this is if you add up the area underneath the curve, you'll find that you've already

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.140
lived half of the total by age 6.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.400
So, I really don't think this is how our brains perceive time.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.700
You really think that, like, a day now is-

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.160
"Of course not." [laughter]

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.940
I think there are better reasons why time appears to speed up as we get older.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.160
So I've come to Venice Beach to find two groups of people: The older and younger

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.480
to see if their perceptions of time differ.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.560
So what I want to do is I want to set my timer going and without counting,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.140
you tell me when you think a minute is up.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.640
"Let's go."

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.140
Start.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.640
"Okay."

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.320
Everywhere around the world, when this experiment is performed, older people typically overestimate

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.920
while younger people measure it quite accurately.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.300
"Alright, probably stop?"

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.800
"Yep."

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.380
Wooo, one minute, two seconds.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.880
A minute and two seconds.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.760
A minute and five.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:57.480
As we get older, the rate at which our neurons fire, or our neuron conduction velocity, it decreases.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.180
And you can think of this firing rate a little bit like an internal clock.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.960
And so, if our internal clock is slowing down, that would make everything else, external time,

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.480
seem to be speeding up.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.020
"I'm going to tell you the time."

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.520
Now?

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.020
"Now."

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.580
"One minute."

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.860
That's it? That was one minute?

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.420
"One minute."

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.960
Minute, seventeen seconds.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.460
"Not bad, right?"

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.020
Not bad.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.160
"I thought I'd be a lot closer actually, but I guess I wasn't."

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.140
Do you want to know what it really was?

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.440
One minute forty seven.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.880
"No way, it was almost two minutes? It was actually almost two minutes."

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.940
"It really is amazing how fast time flies by, it really is."

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.500
Our sense of time, or chronoception, is not like one of the standard five senses. It has no specialized

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.400
receptor cells and it does not appear to be localized in just one part of the brain.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.560
Perhaps this suggests that it's not one coherent thing at all.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.800
But it does seem that our perception of time is very fundamental.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.000
Studies of rats have shown that even with their neocortex removed - that is, the higher order thinking

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.700
part of their brains- They are still able to learn how to time forty seconds accurately.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.540
That's quite remarkable, and it suggests our sense of time evolved early and is one of the fundamental

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.980
functions of the brain.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.500
But that doesn't mean out brains always represent time faithfully.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.860
For example, have you noticed that really good movies seem to go by much faster than they actually are?

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.680
Or do you notice that your vacations fly by? There are good reasons for this.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.960
When we're focused on something, we don't notice that time is passing and that makes them feel in the moment

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.120
shorter than they actually are.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.820
At its best, this results in a mental state called "flow". This can happen when playing sports or video games

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.800
or artists when they're fully engrossed in their work or people meditating.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.340
So I would argue another reason time speeds up as we age is because we are more often engrossed in

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.060
what we're doing.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.480
Another thing that appears to make time speed up is repetition. I'm going to show you a series of images

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.920
and I want you to consider how long each one appears on the screen.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.200
Are you ready?

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.120
Go.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.220
So which one appeared to last the longest? If you're like most people, you'd probably say the dog.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.300
But all of those images actually appeared on screen fore the same length of time. The dog seemed longer

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.840
because it was novel and therefore, your brain had to invest more energy in processing it.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.920
What's remarkable is that our sense of how long something is - or subjective duration-

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.140
It correlates highly with how much energy we're using in our brains. Now, if you study how much energy people

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.980
use in their brains over the course of their lifetime, you'll find that it peaks around age five.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.040
If you think about it, this kind of makes sense because when you're a kid, almost everything is novel to you.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.000
And therefore, your brain needs to use more energy, fully 66% of your resting energy intake.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.380
That's used by the brain because of all the novel experiences and that must, at least in part,

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.060
explain why time appears to go more slowly.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:58.360
So, what can we do to slow time down? Well, studies have shown that being afraid increases our perception

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.080
of time.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.920
When arachnophobes were forced to stare at spiders for 45 seconds - Yes, this is a real experiment -

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.480
Those arachnophobes judged that experience as lasting much longer than 45 seconds,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.320
as you would kind of expect.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:18.200
Plus, experiments involving skydivers or people falling showed that they judged their experience to last

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.360
much longer than it actually is.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.300
Another time when time appears to pass slowly is when you're bored.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.700
"You know, when you're waiting and waiting, that's all you think about, so it seems like time drags forever."

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.000
Since there is so little to focus on, you are acutely aware of just how much time is passing,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.800
and so these boring moments drag on and on.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.580
So, if you really want to slow down your experience of time, you could scare yourself, take up extreme sports,

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.500
get into accidents and intersperse all of that with periods of boredom.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:54.660
But this viewpoint ignores one important fact, which is that we don't experience time as just one thing.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.920
We think about time as it passe, but also as it has passed before, when we remember it.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.300
And those two ways of looking at time, they don't align.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.680
So for example, holidays, they feel like they go by really fast, but when you think back upon them,

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.500
they last a long time.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.760
That's because you had a lot of novel experiences and your brain formed a lot of memories.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.340
And it judges the duration of that vacation by the number of memories that were formed.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:28.860
All that novelty means lots of memories means it feels like it took a long time, but in the moment, it felt fast.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.700
This is the paradox, the great paradox, of our perception of time.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:40.140
If you want time to go slowly, there are a lot of things you can expose yourself to that will slow time down,

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.180
but they won't necessarily be pleasant.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:49.840
So maybe the happiest life and the longest remembered life is one where time really seems to fly.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.800
It's like Einstein said, "Put your hand on a stove for a minute and it'll feel like an hour.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.360
But sit next to a pretty girl for an hour and it'll feel like a minute."

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.920
So, what would you like your life to feel like?

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.960
I want to thank the National Geographic Channel for sponsoring this episode of Veritasium.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.720
And if you want to introduce more novelty into your life, than you should check out their series, "Brain Games"

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:22.020
The new season begins February 14th at 9/8 Central. And this season, they have an episode about

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.620
all of your senses, including your sense of time, chronoception.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.980
So if you want to find out more, than check out the link to their website in the description.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.120
And thank you for watching.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.040
Did that feel like that lasted long?
