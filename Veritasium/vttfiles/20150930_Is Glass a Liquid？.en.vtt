00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:07.700
In 1994, a massive earthquake shook the Northridge suburb of Los Angeles, killing 57

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:15.240
people and injuring over 5000. The cost of damages was in excess of $20 billion. It's

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.760
earthquakes like this one that make us question just how solid is the earth beneath our

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.460
feet, and what does it mean to be solid anyway?

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.580
At first glance, pitch looks like a solid, but it's not. It's actually a liquid at room

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:38.640
temperature—just a very viscous one. Viscosity is a measure of resistance to flow—what we

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.480
often think of as the "thickness" of a liquid. Olive oil is nearly 100 times more viscous

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.460
than water, and honey is about 100 times more viscous than that. Meanwhile, pitch has a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.040
viscosity 2.3×10¹¹ times that of water. At the university of Queensland in Australia,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.760
pitch is the subject of the world's longest running lab experiment, and it's still going to this day.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.500
Back in 1927, this glob of pitch was placed into a funnel, and ever since then, in nearly

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:18.280
90 years, it has produced only 9 drips—roughly 1 a decade—and no one has ever been in the

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:26.040
room to see a drop fall. Though in 1988, the former custodian of the experiment, John Mainstone,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.020
came very close to observing a drip fall, except he stepped out of the room

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.540
for just a few minutes to get a cup of tea. Now, you can actually watch this experiment

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.800
live—there's a link in the description—but since the last drop happened in 2014, I think

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.240
you'll probably be waiting a while.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.780
Another substance that you may have heard is a very viscous liquid is glass. If you look

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.080
at the stained glass windows of old churches, you'll find the bottom of the pane is

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.020
decidedly thicker than the top, and that's because the glass has been flowing down over

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:08.500
centuries... Actually, no, it hasn't! You know, we've looked at old telescopes where the

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.520
optics is very sensitive to slight shifts in the lens glass, and we find they still work

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.160
perfectly after hundreds of years. Plus, studies of thousand year old windows find no

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.880
real evidence of flow. So the truth is that it's just very difficult to make glass of

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.080
uniform thickness, and so when the glass was originally installed thousands of years ago,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.780
they would install the thickest part towards the bottom. The lead actually has a lower

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.680
viscosity than the glass, so if the glass had even thickened a little bit, then the lead

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.500
should be a puddle on the floor by now.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.420
Now, glass is unusual in that it's an amorphous solid, meaning that the silica molecules

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.420
are not regularly arranged as in a regular crystalline lattice. Instead, they're all in a

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.400
jumble, and this is because the glass is cooled down so quickly from the liquid state to

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.760
the solid state that the molecules don't have time to arrange themselves in a nice

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.820
regular crystal structure—but what makes something a solid rather than a liquid is that

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.060
all of the atoms or molecules are so strongly bonded together chemically that they can't

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.380
slide past each other. So in water, or olive oil, or pitch, the molecules can slide past

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.140
each other, but in glass, at room temperature, they can't.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.740
So what about the interior of the Earth? Beneath the Earth's crust is the mantle, which

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:36.500
is responsible for plate tectonics, and therefore earthquakes. Is it a solid or a liquid?

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.780
We can obviously never observe the mantle directly, but when we do see material come out

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.260
from underground, it is red hot rock—it's lava. So you might be imagining that the mantle

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.740
is very similar, made up of this molten magma—hot liquid rock—and that would make sense,

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:01.120
because in order for it to flow, it must be a liquid, right? Actually, wrong! The mantle

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.900
is a solid. Under all that pressure, even though it's at very high temperature, it

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.400
remains in a solid state, and we know the mantle is solid because shear waves from

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.680
earthquakes can actually propagate through the mantle. These waves cannot propagate

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.900
through liquid, like the molten iron of Earth's outer core, because liquids flow in

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.620
response to being sheared—or rubbed sideways—and as a result, we can see the shadow of

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.440
the liquid outer core by measuring seismic waves from an earthquake on the other side of

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.400
the world—but how exactly does this solid rock flow?

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.060
Well, the answer lies in the fact that crystals aren't perfect. There may be a missing

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.860
atom here or there, and under the high pressures in the mantle, sometimes a neighboring

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.120
atom will pop in to fill that gap. Now, from a human perspective it takes a very long

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.780
time for this to have a noticeable effect, but from the Earth's perspective, it happens

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.120
in no time at all. The viscosity of the mantle is similar to that of glass, to several

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.860
orders of magnitude greater, so it is really only over these geological time scales that

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.240
the mantle is fluid-like at all.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.500
So pitch—a liquid—can flow so slowly as to seem like a solid, whereas the Earth's mantle—

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.480
a solid—behaves like a fluid if you just wait long enough. As the famous American

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.360
geologist Grove Karl Gilbert once said:

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.320
"To my mind it appears that the difficulty is only imaginary and not real. Rigidity and

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.820
plasticity are not absolute terms, but relative, and all solids are in fact both rigid

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.900
and plastic... When great masses and great forces are involved ... the distinction loses value."

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:48.160
Sometimes the rigid definitions we create for ourselves can introduce misconceptions, or

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:54.680
viscous rumors, like the idea that the core of the Earth is a giant ball of magma. If

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.220
only we could think about liquids and solids a little bit more...fluidly.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.460
Hey! This episode of Veritasium was supported by Audible.com, a leading provider of

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.980
audiobooks, with over 180,000 titles in all areas of literature, including fiction,

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.400
non-fiction and periodicals. This week I wanted to recommend to you a brand new

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.960
science-fiction book published in 2015. It is by Neal Stephenson, and the book is called

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.480
'Seveneves', and it's about a massive catastrophe that threatens the Earth. I think that

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.180
if you're into science, you will really enjoy it, and you can actually download this book

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.700
for free by going to audible.com/veritasium, or you can pick any other book of

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.920
your choosing for a one month free trial.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.320
So, I really wanna thank Audible for supporting me and I wanna thank you for watching,

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.880
and if you haven't signed up for my mailing list yet, that is something you should

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.720
probably do. You can click on this card here and go over to Veritasium.com, and that is

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.080
where I will be announcing some very cool things coming out very soon. So yeah,

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.260
check it out, if you haven't already. Bye!
