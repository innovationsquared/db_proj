00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.040
On November 16th, representatives from nearly 60 nations

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.060
will be meeting in Versailles, France

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.640
to vote to change the definition of a kilogram.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.720
Not only that, they will also be changing the fundamental unit of temperature, the kelvin,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.600
the unit for amount of substance, the mole,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.080
and the unit for electric current, the ampere.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.160
That is four of the seven base S.I. units in one day!

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.880
And after that all S.I. units will be based on fundamental constants of nature,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.080
and not physical artifacts.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.760
The kilogram is the last base SI unit to be defined by a physical object.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.000
Since 1799, one kilogram has been defined as exactly the mass

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.120
of a single metal cylinder stored in Paris.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.960
It was swapped out once in 1889.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.680
But this International Prototype Kilogram (or Big K as it's affictionately known) has problems!

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.640
I mean, weighting it with in theory identical cylinders, scientists have found

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.360
that their masses are diverging.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.320
So it doesn't even seem to maintain it's mass.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.240
Plus, it's really hard to get access to Big K,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.040
and that makes using this definition really difficult.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.760
So how do you create a mass standard that will never change,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.240
and also be available to everyone everywhere?

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.400
With the solution is you set Planck's constant to have a fixed, exact value.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.080
Now I know that sounds a little strange, so bear with me for a moment.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.520
I mean, Planck's constant is best known for relating the frequency of a photon,

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.880
particle of light, to it's energy.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.920
But we also know that energy and mass are related through E = mcÂ²,

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.920
so, hopefully, you can see how Planck's constant is involved in mass.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.120
But problem as it stands today as I'm
recording this video

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.660
is that Planck's constant has some uncertainty.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.740
I mean we know the value of Planck's constant to a large number of decimal places

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.780
but those last couple of digits...

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.300
They're actually uncertain.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.320
What is certain is the mass of
that platinum-iridium cylinder stored in.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.320
a climate-controlled vault in a basement
in Paris it is exactly one kilogram

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:19.260
No uncertainty. So the solution is to flip
this on its head set Planck's constant

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.200
to have an exact fixed value and then
that cylinder in Paris will no longer be

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.310
exactly 1 kilogram I mean it'll be a
kilogram but not exactly the thing that

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.800
is now exact is Planck's constant which
determines how big a kilogram is.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.180
But if you're gonna fix the value of Planck's
constant well you better get that value

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.660
right, so that it's consistent with all
of our current measurements and all of

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.340
the masses that exist in the world right
now. and so for the last several years

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.920
And so for the last several years,

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.540
scientists around the world have used
multiple different techniques to try to

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.680
measure Planck's constant as accurately
as they possibly can.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.820
One of the major methods was using a
watt balance, where essentially, they

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.430
balance the weight of a kilogram with
the force from an electromagnet if you

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.800
want more detail you should check out my
video on that topic.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.560
Scientists also created arguably the roundest object in
the world made of one type of silicon

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.580
atoms these methods have been
complementary because now they're able

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.520
to compare all of their different
findings from physics and from this more

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.510
chemistry method of Avogadro's constant
and determine what Planck's constant

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.620
really should be. So if the vote goes
well the future definition of Planck's

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.700
constant will be that it is exactly this
number.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.820
Planck's constant is fixed.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.220
That cylinder in Paris, no longer exactly
equal to a kilogram.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.680
But you can't redefine the kilogram in isolation,
because other base S.I. units depend on it.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.200
Take the mole for example. Currently, the
mole is defined as the amount of

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.220
substance that contains the same number
of particles as there are atoms in 12

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.200
grams of carbon-12
that's Avogadro 's constant and it depends

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.750
on what 12 grams is which depends on
what a kilogram is so again Avogadro's

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.080
constant currently has some uncertainty
but after the vote the plan is to fix

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.100
Avogadro's constant to be exactly this
number in such a way that it is internally

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.240
consistent with the new definition of
Planck's constant. There's a direct

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.820
relationship between Avogadro's constant
and Planck's constant.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.360
Likewise, ampere will no longer depend on the
kilogram. Instead, it will be defined

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.560
based on this newly fixed value for the
charge on an electron; and the Kelvin

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.820
will be based on the newly fixed
Boltzmann constant, which relates the

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.720
temperature of a gas to the average
kinetic energy of the molecules, and this

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.720
will be its exact value with no
uncertainties.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.140
Now will these new definitions change anything?

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.160
Well for most people, no. I mean, your food is still

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.460
going the way the same, as are you. And
temperature is still gonna work the same way.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.360
You know, everything basically stays the same,

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.460
and that is as it should be. The
point of this definition change is not

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.810
to shake things up, but to keep things
consistent and reliable forever.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.130
All we're doing is removing the
dependence on a physical object, which

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.810
theoretically, at least, makes it possible
for anyone, anywhere to make incredibly

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.580
precise measurements.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.440
Now, I should point out that a volt will actually change by

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.980
about one part in ten million, and
resistance will change by a little bit

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.260
less than that. And that's because back
in 1990, the electrical metrologists

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.390
decided to stop updating their value of
effectively Planck's constant and just

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.760
keep the one they had in 1990 and there
was a benefit to that.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.400
They didn't have to update their definitions, or their
instruments, but now that we've realized

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.760
that Planck's constant is actually
slightly different than the 1990 value

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.580
because of better measurement techniques.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.620
Well, now the electrical metrologists will

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.100
have to change, but that's a very tiny
change for a very tiny number of people.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.000
I think they'll be fine.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.140
You know I've
been trying to ask myself the question,

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:17.040
why am I so interested in this topic? I
mean, I made like four videos on it and

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:25.080
the reason is, you know, to me the world
and the universe is a big complicated place.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:32.300
And when we're actually able to
ascribe numbers to it, it's like we are

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.300
resting some sort of order out of the
chaos that is our universe and that

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.750
is the beginning of our understanding of
the way things work. You know

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:47.520
measurements are the foundation of
science they allow us to make observations.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.780
I think it's no surprise
that, you know, Kepler was really able to

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.630
figure out what was going on with the
planet that they were actually moving

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:58.550
in elliptical orbits. Once Tycho Brahe he
had made the most accurate measurements

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.060
of their positions that people had ever
made I mean I think that's no

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.550
coincidence and if you look at the
discovery of the Higgs boson at CERN or

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:14.120
the detection of gravitational waves.
These are, in my view, the pinnacle of

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.260
human achievement. I think there are
orders of magnitude greater than the

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.730
achievements that then we make in
literature, and art, and fashion; and I

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.910
don't say that to disparage those
disciplines. I know that they're hard I

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.730
know they take a lot of human brain
power and I'm not saying scientists are

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:33.500
smarter but the tools that scientists
work with and the system in which they

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:38.600
work is what allows them to make such
great leaps because science builds on

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:46.490
itself in almost, you know, an
exponentially improving way and that to

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:50.270
me is why this is so important is
because it allows us to take our

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:55.730
measurements to the next level. No longer
are we bound to physical objects. I mean,

00:07:55.730 --> 00:08:02.180
face it, up until now, we've essentially
been doing a glorified version of Indiana Jones.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.440
Now, we are taking that
next leap to the abstraction that all of

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:11.180
our units are based on the way nature is
and the way the universe is. We're no

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:16.750
longer tied to physical objects.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:21.740

City and the social media circus that
ensues and I think Hank has some really

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:03.380
interesting insights in this world and I
find it really well written of course

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.380
