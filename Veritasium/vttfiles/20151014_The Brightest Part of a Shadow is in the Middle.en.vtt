00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.960
Where is the darkest part of a shadow?

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.600
I mean the obvious answer seems to be, right in the middle.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.900
If you look closely at a shadow, as you move the object away from the wall,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.900
you notice that the shadow gets a bit fuzzy.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.280
So clearly, the edges are lighter.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.840
Now, we know that light bends around corners,

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.840
that's a phenomenon call "diffraction".

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.920
So, is it diffraction that's responsible for the fuzzy edges of shadows?

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.220
Actually?... No.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.600
The reason that shadows have fuzzy edges,

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.719
is because most light sources like the sun are not perfectly point objects.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.780
So, light from one edge of the sun is coming at a very slightly different angle

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.780
from light from the other edge of the sun, and that's what gives us these fuzzy edges. It's not diffraction.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.320
But diffraction can play a significant role in shadows,

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.569
and in fact, it was the cause of a massive debate, about 200 years ago...

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.140
In 1818, the French Academy sponsored a competition to try to find the best explanation of diffraction.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.180
And Augustine Fresnel entered this competition with the suggestion that light is a wave phenomenon.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.740
And just like any ordinary wave, it bends as it passes around an obstacle.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.220
But one of the judges was Simeon Poisson, a harsh critic of the wave theory.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.920
He much preferred Newton's idea that light was a stream of particles.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.700
And to show just how ridiculous the wave theory was,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.440
He showed that Fresnel's theory would predict a bright spot in the shadow,

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.780
right in the middle of the shadow behind a circular object.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.540
That there would be a spot, almost as bright as if the object wasn't there at all.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.020
And he thought this was absurd. But my question is,

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.220
Does it exist? Is the brightest part of a shadow really in the middle?

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.580
To find out, we're gonna have to do the experiment.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.960
So first I had to find some circular obstacles.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.520
I selected spheres instead. I got some marbles and some small spherical magnets.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.180
Then for a powerful light source and a large distance to the screen, I selected a lecture theater with a projector.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.960
Now the first thing we're gonna need is a small aperture for the light to pass through.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.340
So I'm gonna poke a hole in this card with a screw.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.680
It's important to have a small aperture because you want the light to be in phase.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.820
And that should work if it's all coming out of this small little aperture.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.140
But when I put a sphere in front of it ...

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.520
Alright, somebody hit the lights. Here we go...

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.740
I can't see a bright spot. I can't really see anything.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.960
So next I tried a cellphone flashlight, putting a marble in front of that

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.040
And again I could see nothing.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.940
I don't see anything in the middle.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.880
The idea with Poisson's spot is that light should diffract around a circular object, or a sphere,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.440
And because the center of the shadow is equidistant from all the edges of that obstacle,

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.680
all of the light should constructively interfere at that point creating that bright spot.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.780
So next I tried an overhead projector.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.200
I tried a string of the small spherical magnets.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.580
It's weird. Like, I feel like I can see it.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.640
Derek: Do you think you can see a bright spot in the middle of that bottom one?       Girl: No.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.800
Derek: No?

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.760
I feel like in the very center of each one, I can see a bright spot.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.660
I don't know. My eyes are just totally going nuts up here.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.640
Like, staring at shadows and trying to see what we want.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.780
But this one is opaque. It's nice and speherical. Set it down...

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.060
And if I adjust the focus...

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.040
You can see there's a bright spot right in the middle of that marble.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.620
So the spot looks pretty good, but something about it didn't sit right with me.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.480
And you know, when you think something is true,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.880
you really should try as hard as you can to disprove it.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.860
What if you used your fingers to kind of  make the edges less spherical? Yeah

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.940
You see now that, that I think is concerning, that fact we can still see a bit of spot even though

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.000
it looks like you're...

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.880
Right? How is the light getting through and getting there?

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.240
What was really happening, was light was coming up from

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.820
from the base of this overhead projector, bouncing off this lens,

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:30.620
back onto the top of the marble, and then back up through this lens, and onto the wall.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.580
So finally I decided to use a laser

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.400
I resisted doing this earlier because in 1818 they didn't have lasers.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.040
In fact, Poisson didn't do the experiment. He didn't think that you needed to.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.020
The idea of a bright spot in the middle of a shadow was just so ridiculous.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.500
And Fresnel didn't do the experiment either.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.600
But one of the other judges by the name of Arago decided to actually do the experiment.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.140
And when he did it, he saw something similar to what I saw.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.020
So here I was using the laser through a diverging lens.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.860
And then that beam was shone onto a marble resting on top of a loop of tape.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.760
So you can see on the wall, basically exactly what you'd expect.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.860
Just a shadow of the marble

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.560
But when you turn the lights off... there it is...

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.220
A bright spot right in the middle of that shadow.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.220
So the brightest part of a shadow is, in the middle!

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.940
As long as it's the shadow of a circular or spherical object.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.120
Now this spot is sometimes called Arago's spot because he did the experiment and found it.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.660
Sometime's it's called Fresnel's birght spot because it was his theory.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.940
But pretty frequently, it's referred to as Poisson's spot.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:49.180
A harsh reminder that it's not only your great achievements, but also your greatest mistakes

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.920
that can be named after you.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.200
We don't see Poisson's spot in our day-to-day lives for many reasons,

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.360
one of which is that most objects are not prefect circles.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:06.060
Plus if they have any surface roughness, really any at all, that will completely wash out Poisson's spot.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.620
And finally, most light sources are not coherent.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.260
That is, the waves are not coming all in phase: peaks with peaks and troughs with troughs.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:19.200
You might think you could never see Poisson's spot under ordinary conditions.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.520
But you can...

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.140
What you need to do is look at a diffuse source of bright light

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.720
like a fluorescent tube or the blue sky.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.560
You should see some small light specks drifting around your visual field.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:41.240
Now those are caused by floaters. Little particles actually drifting around inside your eyeball.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.540
And they can be all sorts of different shapes, but some of them are spheres.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.400
And so they cast a shadow on the back of your retina.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.020
And right in the middle of that shadow is Poisson's bright spot.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:58.060
And that is what demonstrated that light really is a wave phenomenon.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.580
And you don't even have to take my word for it.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.440
You can see it with your very own eyes.
