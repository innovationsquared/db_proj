00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.660
What is light?

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.140
What is light? Light is... light is... what is light? That's a good question, isn't it? What is light?

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.760
Isn't it an element?

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.800
Light is brightness, I guess.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.500
- We have auras?
- We all have auras.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.220
- Which are light?
- Yes, they are.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.980
It lights up the room, it makes it... not dark.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.000
- What's the difference between blue light and red light?
- The color.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.140
It goes in your eyes and then you see stuff.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.040
The range from white to red to orange to green, it's like the chakras of your body.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.240
- Can you see my aura?
- No, not particularly right now.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.180
- Is it too bright out?
- It's very sunny out here today.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.340
- Does that make it harder to see someone's aura?
- Not necessarily.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:58.740
If I was to explain it to a blind person, I'd... It would be... It would be the difference... You see nothing whatsoever as a blind person, whereas I see things in front of me.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:06.840
To be fair, the question of what light is, is not an easy one. For centuries, the greatest minds in science debated this issue.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.560
In the late 1600s, Newton proposed that light was a stream of particles or corpuscles. He proposed this in his treatise, Opticks.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.260
But at the same time, a dutch physicist named Huygens proposed that light was a wave.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:27.760
And this debate raged on until it was settled by the experiment I've recreated today, Thomas Young's double slit experiment.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:36.700
To make sure I got the experiment right, I went to the original source. With a help of Brady Haran, I managed to get into the vault, underneath the Royal Society in London.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.180
We're in!

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.540
There, I found Thomas Young's handwritten notes from 1803.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.840
I brought into the sunbeam a slip of card, about one-thirtieth of an inch in breadth,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.000
and observed its shadow, either on the wall or on other cards held at different distances.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.280
Besides the fringes of color on each side of the shadow,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.120
the shadow itself was divided by similar parallel fringes, of smaller dimensions.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.460
Wow.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.900
This is an experiment so simple that you could make it at home, and yet so fiddly that I've never seen it before done with sunlight.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.820
- I was thinking about doing it in a box, like a fridge box.
- And you could take it out on the street.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.980
Taking it out on the street.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.260
Could I possibly interview you guys for about a minute?

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.260
We're doing a science experiment.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.380
What I have here is an empty box, and this is a little eye piece where we can look in, and this is a hole.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:33.620
And I'm gonna place this slide above that hole, and if you look closely, you'll see that there is two openings, very narrow openings side-by-side. It's a double slit.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:41.000
Now, before we have a look, we need to tilt it towards the sun a little bit, so...
we want the sun to hit this double slit directly.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.800
- What are we gonna see on the bottom of the box?
-The obvious thing you think you're gonna see is you're gonna see two lines.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.580
Two lines on the bottom of the box.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.380
Two broad-bands.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.800
- Two little lines.
- Yeah.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.620
I think it will be one... one line, sort of two.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.220
I can expect to see the whole box lit up.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.240
- Probably a kaleidoscope, of some sort.
- A bunch of colors.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.300
Probably, yeah.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.820
Rainbow? Different colors?

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.040
There, have a look.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.760
You expected to see kind of one line - is that what you see?

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.560
No!

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.740
I see dots.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.480
How many?

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.480
It's one circle.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.420
Oh, there's one.. there's one in the middle, the strongest, two either side.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.160
The two on the outside are multicolored, and the one in the middle... is just white.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.440
It looks kind of a rainbow.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.220
The rainbow of color as well.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.060
Quite a few colors and lots of little dots.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.280
And there are more dots appearing.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.960
I think I can even see more dots spreading along. Yeah, that's amazing.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.920
Yeah, I can see tons of dots now. Not tons, but I can see dots spreading across that way.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.480
- On either side?
- Yeah, definitely.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.380
- Isn't that amazing?
- Yeah, that's incredible.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.080
- And that's just nothing else apart from... 
- Two slits.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.180
That's incredible.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:59.520
But all we're doing is we're putting light through two very narrow slits side-by-side, so how does this make any sense?

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.540
There's some kind of principle involved in it that the average person's not familiar with. That's the only explanation.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.760
I'm really confused by it, but I'd like to find out why.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.420
People were debating: Is light a wave or is it made of particles?

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.600
So what causes that?

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.100
Well, if light were behaving as particles, you would expecting to go through each slit and just produce a bright spot underneath,

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.060
so we would see two bright spots under the bottom of the box.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.060
But, if light is behaving as waves, then the wave from one slit can interact with the waves from the other slit.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.720
I've got a demonstration here on a little pond, where we can see this with water waves.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:46.180
I have two sources of ripples, which are basically like the two slits, when I create ripples with a single source, they travel out with circular wave front, nothing particularly surprising there.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:53.380
But, if I add a second source of ripples, then we start getting an interesting pattern.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.380
This pattern is created by the ripples from the two sources interacting with each other.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:09.900
Where they meet up peaks with peeks and troughs with troughs, the amplitude of the wave is increased, that's what we call constructive interference.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:17.720
But if the peak from one wave meets up with the trough from the other, then we get destructive interference and there's basically no wave there.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.560
And this is exactly what was happening with the light.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.540
When the light from one slit met up peaks with peaks and troughs with troughs, they constructively interfered and produced a bright spot.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:36.380
But, if the trough from the wave from one slit met up with the peak of the wave from the other slit, they would destructively interfere, and you wouldn't see any light there.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.120
It's light canceling itself out.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.640
- This is basically the same is like having two drops of waterfall in a swimming pool,
- That's right,

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.580
- exactly the same pattern.
- and then they're going overlap

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.170
As this ripple overlaps with those ripples, down the bottom, you get a series of...

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.170
you get like a bright spot... and then a dark spot, then a bright spot, then a dark spot, then a bright spot.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.620
Now there is a slight complication, which is that sunlight is composed of many different colors, and they have different wave lengths.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:07.640
So, obviously, they're gonna meet up at slightly different points, and that's what caused the rainbowing effects as we go further from the central maximum.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:14.260
You saw the ones to the right were slightly colored, that's because the reds are gonna meet up at different places than the blues.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.780
And that's all that makes color differences, is different wavelengths?

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.420
- Exactly.
- That's amazing.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.160
So the difference betweenâ€”

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.840
So that red bin over there on the green pot it's just... I'm seeing that

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.340
- It's a different wavelength.
- It's just different wavelength.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.040
- And that's how we're bringing these beautiful colors all around us.
- Exactly.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.780
That's amazing, I'm amazed! Thanks, man!

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:33.520
Thank you!

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.340
I have been enlightened, literally.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:08.440
Now, you may have noticed in that experiment that the light on the bottom of the box was not in the shape of slits, rather they were more kinda round blobs,

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.980
and I want to know why that is.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:20.280
Can you write an answer for me in the comment section? And I'll give you a hint: one of the videos I've linked kind of is suggestive of the answer.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:31.540
So convincing were the results of Young's double slit experiment that the scientific community concluded that light must be a wave, there is no way it could be a particle.
