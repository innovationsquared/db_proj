00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.120
A plane plummets out of the sky,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.762
a speed runner inexplicably
jumps to a higher platform.

00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:07.853
What the?

00:00:07.853 --> 00:00:08.686
What the?!

00:00:08.686 --> 00:00:11.830
And an election
recount is triggered.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.260
All because of the same
invisible phenomenon

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.473
that permeates the universe.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.770
On May 18th, 2003, voters in
Belgium went to the polls.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.560
In many regions, voting
was done on a computer,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.610
something the Belgians had
been experimenting with

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.400
for over a decade.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.220
But the system had a backup.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.460
Each voter would insert a
magnetic card into the machine

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.760
and make their selection on screen.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.540
Their vote was saved both to the computer

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.070
and the magnetic card,

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.360
which they dropped into
a box for redundancy.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.140
Late that night, as the
votes were being tabulated,

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.670
one of the election
officials detected a problem

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.540
with the results from Schaerbeek,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.230
a municipality in central Brussels.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.620
Maria Vindevogel, a little known candidate

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.430
with her own party received more votes

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.760
than was mathematically possible.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.100
They knew this because of the way

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.770
the preferential voting system works.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.450
So they took out the magnetic
cards and started a recount.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.640
One by one, they fed each of them

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.890
through the machines again,

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.080
and after several hours,
the recount was complete.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.480
The vote totals for every candidate

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.370
were exactly the same as before,

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.100
except for Maria Vindevogel.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.360
In her case, the recounted number of votes

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.830
was less than the original by 4,096.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.590
So what went wrong?

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.270
How had her original tally

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.660
been inflated by over 4,000 votes?

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.350
Computer experts were brought
in to run extensive tests

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.600
on the software.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.370
They combed through the
code, but could find no bugs.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.250
They got the computer

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.100
that had made the initial erroneous tally

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.120
and tested the hardware again and again,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.720
but they could not replicate the error.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.790
Everything about the hardware

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.660
seemed to be in perfect working order.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.410
And this left only one
possible explanation

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.070
and it is seriously weird.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.050
The clue comes from the
excess number of votes

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.440
Vindevogel received.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.460
4,096.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.440
Computers work using binary,
strings of zeros and ones,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.880
each corresponding to a power of two.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.820
So somewhere inside the computer
tabulating all the votes

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.080
was a string of bits

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.900
representing the number
of votes Maria received.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.860
It started the day all zeros,

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.830
and then as each vote for her came in,

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.940
it would increment by one.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.140
Physically, this is done by
turning on a transistor for one

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.750
and turning it off for zero.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.110
What's remarkable about the number 4,096

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.530
is that it is exactly a power of two.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.550
Two to the power of 12.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.120
That is the 13th bit.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.730
So for Maria Vindevogel to
receive an extra 4,096 votes,

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.440
only one thing needed to happen.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.053
The 13th bit had to flip
from a zero to a one.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.090
But why would that happen?

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.410
Computers work precisely
because bits don't flip

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.960
unless we want them to, or do they?

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.260
Looking into the problem,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.900
Belgian investigators found
reports of similar issues

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.423
from big computer companies
starting in the 1970s.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.610
In 1978, Intel reported some
strange errors popping up

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.040
in their 16 kilobit dynamic
random access memory or DRAM.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.990
Ones would spontaneously flip to zeros

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.390
with no apparent cause.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.320
The problem turned out to
be the ceramic packaging

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.510
the chip was encased in.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.240
With the demand for semiconductor
packaging skyrocketing

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.730
in the 1970s, a new manufacturing
plant was constructed

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.950
on the Green River in Colorado.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.120
Unfortunately, this site
happened to be just downstream

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.370
of an old uranium mill.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.130
Radioactive atoms made
their way into the river

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.480
and then into the ceramic
packaging for Intel's microchips.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.500
Intel scientists investigating the problem

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.160
found that even trace amounts
of uranium and thorium

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.730
in the ceramic were
sufficient to cause problems.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.400
In their DRAM, memory was
stored as the presence

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.250
or absence of electrons
in a semiconductor well.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.150
The alpha particles emitted
by uranium and thorium

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.150
were energetic and ionizing enough

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.490
to create electron hole
pairs in the silicone.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.450
If an alpha particle is struck
in just the right place,

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.930
it could create a large
number of free charge carriers

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.940
causing electrons to
accumulate in the well

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.600
flipping a one to a zero.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.340
This is known as a single event
upset, a type of soft error.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.690
The error is soft because the
device hasn't been damaged.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.700
The bit has changed,

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.460
but you could erase it and
rewrite it with no problems.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.210
Investigators exposed the
chips to alpha emitters

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.150
with different levels of activity.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.250
And just as you'd expect,

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.950
they found the number of bit
flips directly correlated

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.280
with the number of alpha particles

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.430
the chip had been exposed to.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.550
The reason this problem
was identified in the 1970s

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.830
was because chip components
had been miniaturized

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.500
to the point where a single alpha particle

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.763
could produce enough charge to flip a bit.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.140
Immediately, these findings
attracted a lot of attention.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.650
Before the paper was published,

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.280
it was widely circulated in the industry.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.690
And as a result, chip manufacturers

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.470
were a lot more careful to
avoid radioactive materials

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.300
when producing their
microchips and packaging.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.533
Therefore, the bit flip
that gave Maria Vindevogel

00:05:28.533 --> 00:05:31.380
4,096 extra votes

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.490
wasn't caused by natural
radioactivity in the computer.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.273
So where did it come from?

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.750
After Henri Becquerel
discovered radioactivity

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.960
with uranium in 1896,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.280
scientists sought a way to measure it.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.230
How radioactive were different materials?

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.660
And one way to do this is
with a gold leaf electrometer.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.350
When it's charged, the leaf is repelled

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.210
and you can measure the amount of charge

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.360
by the angle of the leaf.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.440
Now, if ionizing radiation
enters the chamber,

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.790
it rips electrons off air molecules,

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.680
creating positive and negative charges.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.110
Opposite charges are
attracted to the leaf,

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.440
discharging it over time.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.730
The higher the level
of ionizing radiation,

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.630
the faster the device discharges.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.780
In 1910, Theodore Wolf
took his electrometer

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.730
to the top of the Eiffel Tower.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.910
Since radioactivity was found in the soil

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.300
and rocks of earth, he
expected that 300 meters up,

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.740
the radiation would be just a few percent

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.480
of the ground radiation.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.923
Instead he found only a slight decrease.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.670
In 1911, Austrian physicist Victor Hess

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.060
decided to take this experiment further.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.040
Literally.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.370
He loaded electric scopes into the basket

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.200
of a hydrogen balloon.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.370
In his first two flights,

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.630
he observed the same thing as Wolf.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.200
Up to an altitude of 1100 meters,

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.640
both trips revealed no
fundamental change in radiation

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.530
compared to the values
observed on the ground.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.550
But the next year, he
conducted seven balloon flights

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.830
up to an altitude of 5,200 meters.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.410
And here he discovered
something remarkable.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.900
While there was an
initial drop in radiation

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.060
for the first several hundred meters,

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.550
above one kilometer or
so the level increased

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.920
with increasing altitude.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.560
At his maximum height,

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.850
the level of radiation
was several times greater

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.110
than it was on the ground.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.350
The radiation appeared to be
coming, not from the earth,

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.703
but from the sky.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.900
Hess scheduled one of his balloon flights

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.820
during a solar eclipse.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.970
And as the moon passed
in front of the sun,

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.740
he carefully watched his instruments.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.080
But the readings were unaffected.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.130
Even with the sun half covered,

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.060
the level of radiation was the same.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.140
Since no influence of the eclipse

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.250
on the penetrating radiation was noted,

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.700
we conclude that even if
a part of the radiation

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.810
should be of cosmic origin, it
hardly emanates from the sun.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.880
Victor Hess had discovered cosmic rays.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.460
High energy radiation from space.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.280
But what were these rays exactly

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.860
and where were they coming from?

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.750
Well, today we know they
aren't electromagnetic rays

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.240
as many suspected, but particles.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.850
Around 90% are protons,

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:23.750
9% are helium nuclei, and
1% are heavier nuclei.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.870
Some of them are from the sun,

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.630
but they have comparatively low energy.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.220
High energy cosmic rays moving very close

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:36.130
to the speed of light come
from exploding stars, supernova

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.750
in our own galaxy and in others.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.400
And the highest energy particles

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.500
are thought to come from black holes,

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.540
including the super massive black holes

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.730
at the centers of galaxies.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.560
But it's hard to pin down

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.480
exactly where cosmic rays come from

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.410
because as charged particles,

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.250
they're deflected by
magnetic fields in space.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.840
So they can wind their
way through the universe

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.340
for billions of years.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.310
A cosmic ray detected
on October 15th, 1991

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.440
had an energy of 51 joules.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.830
That is a single subatomic particle

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.160
with the energy of a baseball

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.870
going a hundred kilometers per hour.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:20.120
For obvious reasons, it was
dubbed the OMG particle.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.010
But primary cosmic rays like these

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.230
don't make it down to earth's surface.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.270
Instead, they collide with air molecules

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.550
around 25 kilometers above the ground

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.620
and create new particles like pions.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.420
These collide and decay into
other particles like neutrons,

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:40.420
protons, muons, electrons,
positrons and photons,

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.820
which in turn collide
with other air molecules

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.300
in one long cascade.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.330
So from a single primary cosmic ray,

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.620
comes a shower of particles
streaming towards the earth.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.010
It is one of these
particles that investigators

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.570
suspect struck a transistor
in a computer in Belgium,

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:01.820
flipping the 13th bit from a zero to a one

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:06.763
and giving Maria Vindevogel
4,096 extra votes.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.800
But how often do things like this happen?

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.590
In 1911, Charles Wilson made it possible

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.910
to see the cosmic rays all around us

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.270
when he perfected his cloud chamber,

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:22.310
an enclosure with super
saturated water or alcohol vapor.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.500
When a cosmic ray passes
through the chamber,

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.560
it ionizes the gas
causing vapor to condense

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.620
into tiny droplets on the ions,

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.100
revealing the path of the particle.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.320
Alpha particles, helium nuclei,

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.400
leave short thick tracks
while beta particles,

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.510
electrons leave long skinny trails.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.830
In 1932, Carl Anderson identified a trail

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.450
that looked like it was
made by an electron,

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.200
but in the applied magnetic field,

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.500
it curved in the wrong direction.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.280
Implying it had a positive charge.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.730
Anderson had found the
anti electron or positron.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:01.260
It was the first confirmed
sighting of anti-matter.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.850
Four years later, also
using a cloud chamber,

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:07.810
he discovered the muon,
again in cosmic rays.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:09.760
For his discovery of the positron,

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.040
Anderson was awarded the Nobel
Prize in Physics in 1936.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.780
He shared the prize with Victor Hess,

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.140
the man who discovered cosmic
rays in the first place,

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:23.030
invisible particles that
affect our lives in ways

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:25.143
most of us are oblivious to.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.140
This is possibly the rarest thing

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.060
to ever happen in a video game.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:36.930
In 2013, user DOTA_Teabag was
speed running Super Mario 64

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.220
on the console.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.860
In the level Tik Tok Clock,

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.250
he suddenly up warps
onto a higher platform.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:44.580
- [DOTA_Teabag] What the?

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.413
- [Player] Did you get invisible wall?

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:47.170
What?
- Please say you got the---

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:48.430
- [DOTA_Teabag] No, that
was the craziest thing

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:49.810
I've ever seen though.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:52.080
- [Narrator] The move
shaves off a few seconds

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.150
and it seems like a newly
discovered glitch in the game

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.540
that could give speed runners and edge.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.980
User PenandCook12 put out a $1,000 bounty

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.510
for anyone who could
replicate the up warp.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.970
But so far, after six years,

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:08.340
no one has been able to.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.730
The best explanation
anyone can come up with

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.610
is that a cosmic ray caused the glitch.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.430
It's been shown that a single bit flipped

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.350
in the first bite of
Mario's height co-ordinate

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.180
could have caused the effect.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:24.430
On the main level, the
bite was 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.160
But if you flip the last one to a zero,

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.500
it changes his vertical position.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.810
And just by chance,

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:34.630
this new height coincides
with the higher floor.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:37.930
PenandCook12 wrote a script
to manually flip the bit

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:40.420
at the right moment
and was able to achieve

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.610
the same up warp.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.210
This is a particularly visible bit flip,

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:48.130
but the truth is cosmic rays
are triggering bit flips

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.300
all the time.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.710
- An upset there, transient
there can alter the function

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:55.040
of these devices and we
call that a single event

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.120
functional interrupt.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.880
So an entire process can hang.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.010
So a blue screen of death that you get

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.650
might actually have been
a neutron or whatnot.

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.360
- [Derek] When people see
the blue screen of death,

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.010
could that be caused by a cosmic ray?

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:07.230
- Absolutely.

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.230
- These days, there are a number of ways

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:12.550
computer chips are made resilient
in the face of bit flips

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:16.080
like error correction code or ECC memory.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.670
But you can't totally prevent
bit flips from happening.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:24.860
In 1996, IBM estimated that
for each 256 megabytes of RAM,

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.090
one bit flip occurs per month.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.410
And the main culprit seems to be neutrons

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:32.880
created in the shower of
particles from cosmic rays.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.550
Starting in 2009,

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:37.320
Toyota recalled millions of vehicles

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.470
due to the problem of
unintended acceleration.

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.340
- We were in the fast
lane driving at about 70,

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.470
and he said that the car
was continuing to accelerate

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.260
and he couldn't bring it to a stop.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.240
- Many speculated that
cosmic ray induced bit flips

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.130
in the electronic control
system were the cause.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.290
So much so that NASA was called in

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.220
to help with the investigation.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:02.500
But it turns out, cosmic rays
were probably not the culprit.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.030
NASA identified as the main causes,

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.800
sticky accelerator pedals,

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.290
poorly fitted floor
mats and most commonly,

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.680
drivers pushing on the accelerator

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.950
thinking it was the brake.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:19.380
But cosmic rays have caused
crashes of supercomputers,

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.860
especially at higher elevations.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:26.090
Los Alamos National Labs located
2200 meters above sea level

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.610
is constantly dealing with neutron induced

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:30.210
supercomputer crashes.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:33.820
So the software auto saves
frequently and neutron detectors

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.910
have been installed
throughout the facility.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.250
If you go even higher,

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.140
like climbing up to cruising
altitude in a plane,

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.070
you can see the radiation
from cosmic rays increasing

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.110
on a Geiger counter.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:48.610
To .5 microsieverts per
hour at 18,000 feet.

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.580
Up to one microsieverts
per hour at 23,000 feet.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.660
Over two microsieverts
per hour at 33,000 feet.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.440
And over three microsieverts per hour

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.410
at even higher altitudes
and towards the poles.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:00.600
At cruising altitude,

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.080
this increases the chance
of a single event upset

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.610
by 10 to 30 times.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:08.270
This isn't critical if it
happens in your laptop,

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.093
but what if it occurs
in the flight computer?

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.160
On October 7th, 2008,

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.010
an Airbus A330 took off
from Singapore to Perth.

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:19.910
Just over three hours into the flight,

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.170
the plane suddenly pitched down

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:25.340
diving 200 meters in 20 seconds.

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:29.730
Inside the plane, everyone
experienced negative 0.8 Gs

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.140
of acceleration.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.000
It would have felt like
the plane had flipped over.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.040
- The G-Force was enough,

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.610
even with our three point harness

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:40.170
to lift us both out of the seat

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.330
and push us forward as well.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.933
- Minutes later, the plane
dropped another 120 meters.

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:50.590
119 people on board were injured,

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:53.390
many from bumping their
heads into the ceiling.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:56.040
So the pilots decided to
make an emergency landing

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.660
in Learmonth.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.740
In the investigation that
followed, the fault seem to occur

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.360
with the first air data
inertial reference unit,

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.480
or ADIRU for short.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.670
This computer supplies
critical data like airspeed,

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:10.920
angle of attack and altitude.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.710
The way it supplies each of
these pieces of information

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:16.970
is in a 32 bit binary word.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:20.180
The first eight bits identify
the type of information

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:24.410
and bits 11 to 29 encode the actual data.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:26.010
What seems to have happened

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.880
is that a bit flip in the first eight bits

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.430
meant altitude information was mislabeled

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:34.090
as angle of attack information.

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:36.160
Inside the cockpit, alarms went on

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.190
for over speed and stall simultaneously,

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:41.630
something that should be impossible.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.850
But the plane nose down sharply
to correct what it thought

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:49.640
was a stall, throwing passengers
and crew into the ceiling.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.230
Investigators looked into software bugs,

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.920
software corruption, a hardware fail,

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.090
physical environment factors

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:59.540
and electromagnetic interference.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.890
But each of these possibilities
was found to be unlikely

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.540
based on multiple sources of evidence.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.640
The other potential triggering event

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.240
was a single event effect

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.140
resulting from a high
energy atmospheric particle

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.040
striking one of the integrated circuits

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.000
within the CPU module.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.180
One of the challenges
with single event upsets

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.760
is that they are soft errors.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.640
They don't leave a trace,

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:26.070
but interestingly, the
Airbus A330 was built in 1992

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:28.190
when there were no specific regulatory

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:30.370
or aircraft manufacturer requirements

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.620
for airborne systems to be resilient

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.600
to single event effects.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.910
With the space shuttle,

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.430
redundancy was built in from the start.

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:41.520
For navigation and control,
there were four computers

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.640
simultaneously running identical software.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.630
If one computer had a soft error,

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.370
the other three would overrule it.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:50.310
And using this setup,

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:53.400
they could also track the
frequency of bit flips.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.260
On one five day mission, STS 48,

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.680
there were 161

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.383
separate bit flips.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:05.550
Above the atmosphere,
cosmic rays are so energetic

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.070
sometimes you can even see them.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.070
- Once in a while you
have your eyes closed

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:11.450
and you're not asleep yet.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:14.003
And if you wait a little while,

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:18.690
you occasionally will
see a flash of light.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:21.040
And we think it is heavy particles

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.800
or individual bursts of
energy coming from radiation

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.020
that are either going
through the eyeball itself

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.150
or going through the optic nerve.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.220
And they,

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:35.330
the way that your body registers
radiation going through it

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.000
is amazingly enough by
showing you a little flash

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.160
in one of your eyes,

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.130
just to remind you that you
are subject to the radiation

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:46.010
of not only our sun, but
every star of the universe,

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:48.950
that is radiating at you.

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:50.870
I picture back to the first astronauts

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.350
who must have closed their
eyes and seen that radiation

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.067
and gone, "I'm not going
to tell anybody about this

00:18:56.067 --> 00:18:57.807
"because no one's told me about it.

00:18:57.807 --> 00:18:58.640
"I'm not talking."

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.637
I can just imagine the
first two guys that said,

00:19:00.637 --> 00:19:01.807
"Hey, I am,

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:03.217
"sometimes I see flashes of light.

00:19:03.217 --> 00:19:04.470
"Do you see flashes of light?"

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:06.417
And then it's, "Oh, we
all see flashes of light."

00:19:06.417 --> 00:19:08.662
"Oh, okay, well, that's all right then."

00:19:08.662 --> 00:19:09.980
(narrator laughing)

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.260
- [Narrator] For missions
to other planets,

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.890
protecting electronics is critical.

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:16.540
- If a single bit of information

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.150
controls a critical
function on your spacecraft,

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.100
let's say your thrusters,

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.680
and that goes from a one to
is zero, from a on to off,

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.210
or vice versa, you could lose the mission.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.400
- [Narrator] That's why the computer

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.210
on the Perseverance Rover
that just landed on Mars

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:33.280
is 20 years old.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.840
It's a power PC launched in 2001

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.800
with only 256 megabytes of Ram

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.770
and two gigabytes of flash storage.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:43.920
But it is radiation hardened,

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.410
meaning the design, materials,
circuits and software

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:50.500
are built to withstand
40 times the radiation

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.300
of an ordinary computer.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.960
It's been used on over
a dozen space missions

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.260
going back to 2005.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:01.170
- In fact, when we first started
doing the power PC testing

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.680
years ago, the way we did it,

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.710
we just simply stuck an
operating system processor

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:10.860
in a beam line where we
generate these particles

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.070
on the planet and look
for blue screens of death.

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.190
You can kind of figure
out what's going wrong

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:17.360
and try to undo that.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.330
So you don't get to the
blue screen of death

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:22.420
because a spacecraft
that gets into that mode

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.460
is basically unrecoverable.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.810
- As the Voyager 1 spacecraft
departed the solar system,

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:30.480
one of the ways we could
tell was by an increase

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.300
in the flux of cosmic rays it experienced.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.640
Although on earth, the
particles streaming from the sun

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.350
and the solar wind are
a source of radiation,

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:43.040
further out these same particles
maintain protective bubble.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.770
The heliosphere.

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:47.280
It helps deflect and slow cosmic rays

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.910
from interstellar space

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:52.600
protecting the solar system
from ionizing radiation.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.660
But the sun has an 11 year activity cycle.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.300
So this protection fluctuates.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.930
The flux of cosmic rays
on earth is much lower

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:03.843
when the sun is active
than when it's dormant.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:06.990
In the history of our planet,

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:10.610
cosmic rays may have
played an even larger role

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:13.260
flipping bits, not in electronics,

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:16.400
but in the genetic codes
of living organisms,

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.980
providing some of the variation

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.960
on which natural selection acts.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.540
Maria Vindevogel is now a member

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.160
of the Belgium Chamber of Representatives,

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.720
elected by people, not a particle,

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.420
but her story is a reminder
of the zillions of particles

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.140
winding their way through the universe

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.880
for millions or billions of years.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.720
One of which might at any moment,

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:46.320
change your life by passing
through a tiny transistor

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.635
and cra....

00:21:47.635 --> 00:21:51.052
(electronic disturbance)

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:56.490
Discovering the origin of cosmic rays

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:59.730
or where 4,096 extra votes came from

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:02.280
or how to protect the
Mars Rover from radiation

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.660
requires problem solving,
which is a perishable skill.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.940
And the best way to keep your
problem solving skills sharp

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.980
is to solve a diverse range of problems,

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:14.360
which you can do with the
sponsor of this video, Brilliant.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.090
Brilliant is a website and app

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:19.830
that teaches you STEM concepts
in an interactive way.

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:22.360
They have courses on topics
from applied computer science

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.060
to special relativity.

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:26.310
Two courses I would recommend
if you enjoyed this video,

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:29.610
are computer memory and
algorithm fundamentals.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:32.330
Brilliant have really upped
their interactivity recently.

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.690
So instead of reading about algorithms,

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:37.540
you're taught how to
write algorithms yourself.

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.910
Brilliant engages you in active learning.

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:41.230
Instead of telling you the right answer,

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:43.360
they allow you to figure
it out for yourself

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.100
with plenty of helpful hints
and guidance along the way.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.380
And for viewers of this channel,

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:50.100
Brilliant is offering 20%
off an annual subscription

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.170
to the first 200 people to sign up.

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:55.080
Just go to brilliant.org/veritasium.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.130
I'll put that link down
in the description.

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:59.310
So I want to thank Brilliant
for supporting Veritasium

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:01.333
and I want to thank you for watching.
