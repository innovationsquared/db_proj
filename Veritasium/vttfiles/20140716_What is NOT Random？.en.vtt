00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.060
- What will happen tomorrow is not random.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.540
In other words, it's at least somewhat predictable.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.680
I mean, not entirely to be sure, but some
things will happen for certain, and other

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.250
things definitely won't.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.670
For example, the sun will rise, water will
still freeze at zero degrees celsius,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.990
- and you won't become Michael Stevens.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.160
- We know this because everything in the universe
is made of 12 fundamental particles, and they

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.919
interact in four predictable ways.

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:32.060
- What if I were able to determine the positions
and velocities of every single one of these

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.249
particles in the universe?

00:00:33.249 --> 00:00:37.930
- Well, you would be the intelligence envisioned
by Laplace, who thought if you could really

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.190
figure out where everything is and how fast
it's moving, you would know the entire future

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.230
of the universe, because you know how every
particle interacts with every other particle.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.480
- Wow, so nothing would be unpredictable,
which means, nothing would be random.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.579
- Not even human behavior.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.091
Since we are made of the same fundamental
particles as everything in the rest of the

00:00:56.091 --> 00:01:02.469
universe, everything we will ever do, or have
ever done, would be determined by the information

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.680
in the state of the universe at any one time.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.290
- But what is information?

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.170
Well, it seems to be fundamentally about order.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.660
The order of molecules in your DNA contain
the information needed to make you.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.710
It is the order of zeros and ones streaming
through the internet that contain all the

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.020
information required to play this video.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.840
It is the order of letters that makes a word,
and the order of words that makes a sentence

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.450
that carries information.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.080
So fundamentally, information seems to be
about order.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.280
Regularity.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.880
That is, until you really think about it.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.570
I mean, does every letter of a word carry
the same amount of information?

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.570
No.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.330
I mean, after a "Q", you know almost for certain
that the next letter will be a "U".

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.420
After a "Th", there will probably be an "E".

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.320
So these letters carry very little information,
because you could predict them beforehand.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.640
They are redundant.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.170
In fact, the founder of information theory,
Claude Shannon, estimated the redundancy of

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:09.090
English at about 75%, which is why we can
make sense of things like this.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.200
So English can be compressed, because it is
not random.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.200
It has patterns.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.220
Similarly, this video is compressible because
of its regularities.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.770
In each frame, the pixels of similar color
cluster together.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.970
Plus, from frame to frame, most of the pixels
don't change.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.549
So you only need to record the ones that do
change.

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:35.160
- You can take advantage of this technique
to create some trippy effects known as datamoshing.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.090
It's the application of the movement data
from one video, to the pixels of another.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.880
- It also means that an average video can
be compressed to just one thousandth of its

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.590
original size.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.520
- But what is the most you can compress something?

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.810
- Well, anything that is not random, any patters
or regularities, can be reduced, because they

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.150
are predictable.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.709
So you can continue shrinking a file down
until what you're left with is totally random.

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.680
- And that will contain all of the information
of the original item but distilled.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.080
Pure information.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.630
- So pure information is randomness.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.819
If you want to know how much information something
contains, you need to know how random it is.

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.319
And randomness is disorder...

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.319
What we also call ...

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.100
- [Both] Entropy.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.030
- So information, fundamentally, is entropy.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.120
This makes sense if you consider a string
of binary digits.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.069
For example, this string is perfectly ordered.

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.700
It has very low entropy, and it contains no
information.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.599
That's the state of an erased hard drive.

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.069
Now, this string contains slightly more information,
but again, the regularities allow it to be

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.720
easily compressed.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.780
So the string that contains the maximum amount
of information is just-- a random set of zeros

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.770
and ones.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.640
It has maximum entropy because it's totally
disordered.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.110
You could not predict any of those digits
by looking at any of the other digits.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.360
And if you wanted to send this information
to someone, you would have no other option

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.310
but to send the whole string of digits.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.010
There's no way to compress it.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.209
But here's the thing about any object that
contains maximum information.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.419
For us as human beings, they carry no meaning.

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.710
For example, a video containing maximum information
would look like this.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.990
It is just white noise.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.389
The color of each pixel is independent of
all the other pixels, and they all change

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:35.389
randomly.

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.699
This video could not be compressed, because
it's already totally random.

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.809
Now a random sequence of DNA would not make
an organism.

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:47.360
And a random string of letters does not generally
make a word.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.529
We are drawn to things that are neither perfectly
ordered, containing no information, nor are

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:56.729
they perfectly disordered, containing maximum
information.

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:02.599
Somewhere in the middle, we can recognize
complex patterns, and that is where we derive

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:03.599
meaning.

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:05.779
In music, poetry, and ideas.

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:12.310
It is this search for meaning that leads us
to propose scientific theories, which if you

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.089
think about it, are really our way of compressing
the universe.

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:21.139
For example, general relativity, our current
theory of gravity, compresses into one short

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:22.259
equation.

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:25.960
Everything from how an apple falls to the
earth, to how the moon orbits the earth, how

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.379
all the planets orbit the sun, how the sun
orbits a supermassive blackhole at the center

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:35.710
of our galaxy, how blackholes form and behave,
and how the whole universe expands out from

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.370
the Big Bang.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.229
Now that we have this theory, the future is
more predictable.

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:45.250
I mean, we can predict eclipses thousands
of years into the future.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.539
So, with all of our scientific theories, does
that mean that the universe is completely

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:52.379
not random?

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:54.520
That it is perfectly predictable?

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.811
Well, let's assume for a second that Laplace
was right, and that knowing the state of the

00:05:58.811 --> 00:06:04.370
universe at any one time, means you also know
its state at every other time as well.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.520
Well, that would mean that the information
in our universe would be constant.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:17.280
But if information is entropy, that would
mean the entropy of the universe is also constant.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.550
And that does not appear to be the universe
that we live in.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.800
The second law of thermodynamics states that
entropy in the universe increases with time.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.099
Or in other words, things don't stir themselves
apart.

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:33.490
But if entropy is going up, that means the
information in our universe is constantly

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.840
increasing.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.800
That makes sense, because it would take more
information to specify the state of the universe

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.110
now, than right after the Big Bang.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.930
So, where is this new information coming from?

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.069
My best bet is quantum mechanics.

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:51.909
Quantum mechanics describes how the 12 fundamental
particles behave.

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:57.759
And as spectacularly successful as it is,
it is only a probabilistic theory.

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:01.990
Meaning that you cannot predict with absolute
certainty where an electron, say, will be

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.750
at some later time.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.159
You can only calculate probabilities of where
you are likely to find it.

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:12.779
So when you do interact with it, and locate
the electron at a particular point, you have

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:14.629
gained information.

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:19.219
You now know something that you couldn't have
predicted with certainty beforehand.

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:20.749
This drove Einstein crazy.

00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:24.160
He said, "God does not play dice," referring
to this.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.039
I mean, he wished that we could compress our
theory of quantum mechanics further, so that

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:33.270
we could really figure out where these particles
were going to be.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:37.030
But maybe the reason why we haven't been able
to compress quantum mechanics further, is

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.340
because fundamentally, it's random.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:48.289
Fundamentally, new information is being generated
every time a quantum event like that occurs.

00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:55.629
In that case, it could be these quantum measurements
which are driving up the entropy of the universe.

00:07:55.629 --> 00:08:00.089
They are creating new information all of the
time, and that means the disorder in our universe

00:08:00.089 --> 00:08:01.270
must go up.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.569
This is what we observe as the second law
of thermodynamics.

00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:08.710
You know, we often think about the second
law as a curse.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:13.529
As though everything which is ordered is going
towards disorder.

00:08:13.529 --> 00:08:20.509
But maybe, I mean, it's only in a universe
where this law is obeyed, that the truly unexpected

00:08:20.509 --> 00:08:21.960
can occur.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.249
That the future can be actually undetermined.

00:08:26.249 --> 00:08:32.390
For us really to have free will, we need the
second law of thermodynamics.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:37.130
Now, you might think that these quantum events
are too small to have any meaningful impact

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.659
on the evolution of the universe, but that
is not true.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:45.560
And that's because, there are physical systems
which are so dependent, so sensitive to the

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:52.100
initial conditions that any tiny change will
end up making a big difference later down

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.360
the track.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.260
That's called "chaos."

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.319
But it's also known as "the butterfly effect."

00:08:58.319 --> 00:09:01.190
So you and I could be such physical systems.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:02.260
Chaotic systems.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:13.060
And our free will could come from quantum
events in our brains.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.430
So it looks as though we live in a universe
where the future is yet to be determined.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.310
That is to say, it is at least somewhat random.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:23.250
- But Derek, what is the most random thing
possible in the universe?

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.180
- That's a good question, Michael.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:29.899
- You know, it's such a good question, I'm
talking about it over on Vsauce.

00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:32.249
Do you wanna go find out about randomness
with me?

00:09:32.249 --> 00:09:33.379
- Let's go check it out.

00:09:33.379 --> 00:09:34.379
- Alright.

00:09:34.379 --> 00:09:37.089
- And you can decide whether to click over
or not.

00:09:37.089 --> 00:09:38.589
- Oh, that's nice.

00:09:38.589 --> 00:09:39.589
- Yeah!

00:09:39.589 --> 00:09:39.590
- Yeah.
