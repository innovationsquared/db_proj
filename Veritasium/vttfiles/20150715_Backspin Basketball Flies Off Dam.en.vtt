00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.540
Recently some friends of mine went to the Gordon Dam in Tasmania,

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.780
which is 126.5 meters (or 415 feet) high.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.820
Then they dropped a basketball over the edge.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.280
You can see that the basketball gets pushed around a bit by the breeze,

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.660
but it lands basically right below where it was dropped.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.080
Now watch what happens when they drop another basketball,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.320
but this time with a bit of backspin...

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.380
"Woah,  look at that go!"

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.380
"That's incredible."

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.620
"This is Bret who just threw it."

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.120
I litterally just dropped it, with a bit of spin,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.180
like I didn't even throw it, and it just took off, like we had no idea that was gonna do that.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.160
And this is where I come in:

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.500
the basketball was subject to the Magnus effect,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.100
which affects all rotating balls or cylinders as they fly through the air.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.440
And it works like this:

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.520
as the basketball picks up speed,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.580
air on the front side of the ball is going in the same direction as its spin,

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.560
and therefore it gets dragged along with the ball and deflected back.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.500
Air on the other side is moving opposite to the ball spin,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.080
so the flow separates from the ball instead of getting deflected.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.780
The net result is the ball pushes air one way,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.220
so the air applies an equal force on the ball the other way.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.800
And this is known as the Magnus effect,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.420
named after Heinrich Gustav Magnus who described it in 1852.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.680
Of course, Isaac Newton beat him to it by nearly two hundred years,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.640
describing the flight of tennis balls at Cambridge College.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.660
But, you know, he's got enough stuff named after him....

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.100
This effect is very important in sports like tennis, soccer and golf,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.500
but could it have non-sport applications?

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.980
Perhaps.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.400
This is a sailboat. I know it doesn't look like a sailboat,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.860
but those aren't chimneys.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.860
They are spinning cylinders called "Flettner rotors",

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.460
and they take the place of the sails.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.300
They deflect crosswinds, using the Magnus effect, to propel the ship forwards.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.620
And this is a plane with spinning cylinders instead of wings.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.440
Using the Magnus effect, the cylinders actually generate more lift than traditional wings.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.740
However they also generate way more drag, making them impractical.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.880
This place only flew once, and then it crashed.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.380
But the Magnus effect is making a comeback.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.040
Here is an experimental rotor wing aircraft which generates all its lift from spinning cylinders.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.660
And this is the E-Ship 1 which uses four spinning cylinders (that's four Flettner rotors)

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.700
to increase its efficiency and reduce the amount of diesel it burns.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.200
So, in the future, the Magnus effect may help more than just basketballs fly.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.960
"Woah, look at that go!"

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.200
Now the real reason my friends from "How Ridiculous" were at the dam

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.000
was to set the world record for the highest basket ever scored.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.260

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.720
