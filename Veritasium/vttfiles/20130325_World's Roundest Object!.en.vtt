00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.880
Can I hold it?

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.870
Only if you promise to be really, really careful.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.870
I promise I will be so incredibly careful.
I will be incredibly careful with it. I promise.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.730
So, it's slippery, be careful.
Alright, are we ready?

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.500
I'm about to touch a 1kg sphere of silicon-28
atoms. There are about 2.15x10^25 of them.

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.610
It feels absolutely incredible. Wow, that
is amazing.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.289
Besides its creators, I am one of only a handful
of people ever to hold this sphere.

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.300
The raw material used to make it was worth
1 million Euros but now that it has been so

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.940
precisely sculpted --

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.199
How much is that worth?

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:02.370
It's priceless. ... This you are looking at
now is the roundest object in the world.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.700
How can you say for sure it's the roundest
object? I mean the Earth is pretty round,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.470
isn't it?
If this was the Earth...

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.460
If this were the Earth then the highest mountain
to the lowest valley would be... about 14m

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.690
apart.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.560
That is shocking. That is shockingly round.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.280
But why would you invest one million Euros
and thousands of man-hours perfecting a pure,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.010
polished silicon sphere?

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:37.830
Well the answer is grave. Or rather 'grave'
as it would have been pronounced in the original

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.140
French.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.070
You see the grave was the original name for
the base unit of mass in the metric system,

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.950
which became the Systeme International d'unites
or SI units. In 1793, a commision which included

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.220
notable scientist and aristocrat Antoine Lavoisier,
defined the base unit of mass as the weight

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.740
of a cubic decimeter of water at the melting
temperature of ice -- essentially just a litre

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.040
of ice water. The name grave came from the
Latin gravitas, meaning weight.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.420
But it wasn't to last. It sounded too similar
to the aristocratic title 'graf' -- which

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.640
is the equivalent of an earl or a count. And
with the French revolution in full swing with

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.060
the rallying cry of equality for all, you
couldn't exactly have one unit nobler than

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.770
the others. At this Lavoisier lost his head,
literally, not because he helped devise one

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.880
of the greatest systems of measurement of
all time, but because he was collecting taxes

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.560
as a nobleman.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.670
So things really were grave.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.470
The new republican government believed a grave
would be too big for the things they wanted

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.810
to measure anyway and and so they settled
on the gramme, which was just a thousandth

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.280
of the grave.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.480
But soon they realized that a gram was too
small and so they returned to the grave, but

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.650
since they couldn't call it that, they invented
the kilogram -- a thousand grams. And that

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.510
is why out of the seven base SI units, the
kilogram is the only one to have a prefix

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.960
in its name.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.960
In 1799 the kilogram definition was refined
to be the mass of a litre of water at 4 degrees

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.180
Celcius -- the temperature at which it is
densest. But water itself is obviously not

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.630
the most sensible thing to use as a mass standard.
So a pure platinum cylinder was created to

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:29.069
have the same mass as the water definition
and it was declared Kilogram of the Archives.

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.680
Now it's important to note at this point the
kilogram is no longer tied to the mass of

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.200
a volume of water -- the kilogram of the archives
is by definition THE kilogram.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.200
90 years later, in 1889 the kilogram was upgraded
to a platinum-iridium alloy cylinder. Now

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.850
it was much harder than the original but was
otherwise basically identical. And to this

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:58.220
day, it remains the definition of the kilogram.
It is officially called the International

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:05.069
Prototype Kilogram, though it's affectionately
known as Le Grand K -- or Big K. Oh, and it's

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.430
about this big...

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:13.040
It is the only thing in the entire universe
with a mass of exactly one kilogram because

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:20.040
it IS the kilogram. It is also the only SI
unit that is still defined by a physical object.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.530
It sits under three bell jars, next to six
sister kilograms, in a climate-controlled

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.500
vault locked by three independently controlled
keys, in the basement of the International

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.100
Bureau of Weights and Measures on the outskirts
of Paris.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.500
Now if you were able to break into the vault
and tamper with Big K, you would be changing

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.970
the definition of the kilogram, a definition
on which many of our measurements rely, and

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:52.930
so you would throw the world into chaos! Well
no, not actually-- but how would anyone ever

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.630
know if the mass of Big K changed?

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.910
Well when it was first created, 40 identical
replicas were also made. Well they weren't

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.990
quite identical - they had a mass which was
slightly different to Big K but those offsets

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.490
were recorded. Now these replicas were sent
out to countries around the world to serve

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.750
as their national standards.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:19.750
In 1948 the kilograms were reunited for a
weigh-in. And this is when the problems started.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.930
Because even though all the cylinders were
made of the same alloy and stored under virtually

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:31.650
the same conditions, their masses had diverged
over time. The mass of Big K wasn't even the

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.699
same as the six sister cylinders stored with
it. And to make matters worse when they were

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:41.990
brought together again forty years later,
their masses had further diverged, up to about

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.190
50 micrograms - that's about the weight of
a fingerprint. But fingerprints were not the

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.100
culprits since the kilograms were carefully
washed before their weigh-ins.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:57.300
So some physical process must have actually
changed the mass of the cylinders, but how

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:04.300
that exactly works remains a matter of speculation.
One this is for certain, the mass of a platinum-iridium

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:10.320
cylinder is not stable over time. And this
is a big problem. You can't have a unit which

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.790
changes its value.
And the fallout isn't limited to measurements

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:20.540
of mass since of the seven base SI units,
four of them depend on the mass of the kilogram,

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.320
not to mention all the derived units like
Newtons, Joules, Volts and Watts.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.680
At this point those of you in countries that
have not adopted the metric system--yes I'm

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.949
speaking to you Liberia, Burma, and the US--you
may be feeling rather smug that your unit

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:42.600
of mass, the avoirdupois pound, is no longer
defined by a physical object. No, instead

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:48.010
it is defined as precisely 0.45359237

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.870
kilograms. Sucked in.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:58.800
So clearly something needs to be done to eliminate
the kilogram's dependence on a physical object

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.400
and this is where the silicon sphere comes
in, but how exactly does that help?

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.120
Here you have a physical object and it's beautiful
but you know it's still a physical object.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.990
You're trying to get away from that.
We're trying to get away from the physical

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:18.990
object but what we're doing with this particular
object is counting how many atoms are in there.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.509
You can't actually count how many are in there
can you?

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:26.380
You can't count how many are in there but
you can calculate how many are in there because

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.470
this material is silicon, there's no voids
or dislocations.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.259
So this is like a perfect crystal of silicon.
That's right.

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:40.650
Not only is it pure silicon, it contains only
one isotope of silicon, silicon-28, and that

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.389
explains why the original material was so
expensive.

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:49.600
And why a sphere?
Well, a sphere is a pretty simple object.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.400
If you know the diameter of the sphere you
can characterise the entire dimension of the

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.930
object.
Well that explains why the sphere has to be

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:02.729
the roundest object ever created, but how
do you actually make something that round?

00:08:02.729 --> 00:08:08.740
We actually start with an oversized sphere.
So it was about two millimetres larger in

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:15.740
diameter and then we just grind it progressively
finer and finer using abrasive. It's actually

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:21.449
massaging atoms. You're down at that level
of trying to control the shape of an object

00:08:21.449 --> 00:08:25.889
down at the atomic level.
But making the sphere is only half the battle,

00:08:25.889 --> 00:08:31.830
then you need to accurately measure its diameter.
The diameter is actually measured via a laser.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:37.279
So you're actually measuring having the sphere
in the centre of a cavity and a laser is hitting

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:39.759
both sides and you're actually measuring the
gap.

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:44.139
By knowing the diameter you can determine
its volume. And since the atom spacing in

00:08:44.139 --> 00:08:49.600
silicon is known to high precision, you can
the calculate how many atoms make up the sphere.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:55.759
This allows you to redefine Avogadro's constant.
At the moment, Avogadro's constant is defined

00:08:55.759 --> 00:09:01.040
based on the kilogram. It is equal to the
number of atoms in twelve grams of carbon

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.980
12. But using this approach, the number of
silicon atoms in the sphere would be used

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:10.689
to fix Avogadro's constant, which would then
define the kilogram.

00:09:10.689 --> 00:09:15.819
So even if the silicon spheres were lost or
damaged, it would have no effect on the definition

00:09:15.819 --> 00:09:20.679
of the kilogram because it would be defined
not by a physical object but by a concept.

00:09:20.679 --> 00:09:26.540
You would like to see the official definition
of the kilogram say "a kilogram is the mass

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.339
of 2.15x10^25 silicon-28 atoms"
Yes.

00:09:30.339 --> 00:09:37.009
Is it - is it going to happen?
There's a likelihood, a high likelihood that

00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:39.790
it's going to happen.
But there is another approach to redefining

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:45.290
the kilogram which involves fixing Planck's
constant and it's done using something called

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:52.290
a Watt Balance. These two approaches are complimentary.
Each one provides a check on the other, and

00:09:52.369 --> 00:09:56.490
if they show good agreement and are able to
bring their uncertainties down to about twenty

00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:03.490
micrograms they may redefine the kilogram
as early as 2014. And then the kilogram finally

00:10:03.679 --> 00:10:09.980
will be an unchanging unit, no longer defined
by a physical object in the basement vault

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:16.980
of some place in Paris.
Now if the kilogram was originally intended

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:36.139
to be the mass of a litre of water at its
densest temperature then how well did we do?

00:10:36.139 --> 00:10:43.139
Well if you look at a litre of water at nearly
four degrees Celcius it has a mass of 999.975

00:10:43.929 --> 00:10:50.709
grams. So I guess you could look at this two
ways. On the one hand you could say the kilogram

00:10:50.709 --> 00:10:57.389
is slightly heavier than it should be, but
on the other hand 214 years ago, scientists

00:10:57.389 --> 00:11:04.170
were able to create an artifact that was correct
within the margin of error of a grain of rice.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:09.949
Now that is truly remarkable. Now if you want
to hear more about the Watt Balance, let me

00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:14.350
know in the comments and I will see what I
can do. It does seem to be the frontrunner

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:20.329
in terms of redefining the kilogram, so we
will have to wait and see what happens. One

00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:24.480
last thing, I should point out that it took
an international collaboration of scientists

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.209
to create the silicon sphere but don't you
think that the scientist who originally conceived

00:11:29.209 --> 00:11:34.529
of silicon as an element should receive some
of the credit. Well in 1787, that was none

00:11:34.529 --> 00:11:39.069
other than Antoine Lavoisier. So he's been
involved in the definition of a kilogram from

00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:42.060
start to finish or from cradle to grave.
