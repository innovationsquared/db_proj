00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.640
Recently I made a video about what the world looks like in the ultraviolet

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.480
Some things look the same but generally it's hazier

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.920
sometimes light and dark are flipped

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.340
skin looks blotchier and fake teeth stand out

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.370
Whoa!

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.880
Smile for me

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.080
Oh my goodness

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.080
Are my teeth black?

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.680
Do you have a fake tooth baby?

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.920
--Yes --Which one?

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.520
but the idea for this video started a long time ago with a question I had which is,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.260
How does non ionizing radiation like ultraviolet light

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.080
like ultraviolet light damage skin and lead to cancer?

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.240
I do like to tell people that if you want to see how good your skin could look,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.340
look at your butt

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.380
because that's an area that doesn't get sun

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.700
and even old people have perfect butts

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.560
it's how your skin would age without the sun

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.840
when I thought about what UV light must be doing to our cells and our DNA,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.440
I imagined it would be getting in there and breaking all these bonds and that would be the problem

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.800
but in fact it's kinda the opposite

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.340
UV actually facilitates the formation of covalent bonds in our DNA that shouldn't be there.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.020
It comes in and it kind of creates these unauthorized bonds between the bases

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.820
called pyrimidine dimers

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.440
instead of having them bonded across it bonds the one next to each other

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.980
if that makes sense. -- Oh. -- Yeah.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.140
so what happens is two thymines, which are side be side,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.820
can actually get covalently bonded together

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.600
and that creates a lesion on the DNA you can think of it like a little bump

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.540
that makes the DNA hard to read and work with

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.060
That's not enough in itself to cause skin cancer. If that were the case we would just be covered in skin cancers

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.820
then the next step is that we have to repair it

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.360
and in the repair,

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.320
that's when you form mutations that could eventually lead to cancer through a bunch of different pathways

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.220
and there's actually people who have specific

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.700
genetic issues that they can't repair these issues and they are covered in skin cancer

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.080
UV has other effects on the body like

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.520
suppresses the immune system so, as Haley says, it's a "double whammy"

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.000
There's also kind of a double whammy because UV not only induces these unauthorized bonds

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.660
it actually tamps down our natural immune system

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.980
so one of the best ways we fight cancer is through our immune system

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.580
we have constantly need surveillance through our skin

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.340
so not only is sunlight creating these problems,

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.900
It's actually reducing our ability to fix them.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.920
So unfair

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.400
UV light also causes us to visibly age. It's called photo-aging

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.280
I should clear up a misconception here that I had which was, I thought glass blocks all ultra-violet light.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.840
so I thought if you're inside a car, for example, you really don't need to put on sunscreen because,

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.560
you're not being exposed to UV light

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.840
The car does not block UVA. It's glass

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.040
It does block most UVB

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.560
but you're still susceptible to those sunspots and those wrinkles through the glass

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.540
and a lot of my patients if you look and you compare their hands,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.000
the left is is more wrinkled or has more sunspots on it because they're driving.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.140
So they're sticking that hand... --Sticking that hand out their truckers. Absolutely you can see it the worst

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.900
And there's a really famous picture of someone whose left side of their face

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.620
is significantly more, as we'll call photo-aged, or old-looking, than the other side of their face.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.400
So that's mostly UVA and UVA, as I said, it's a longer wavelength, penetrates a little bit deeper.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.440
so wrinkles mostly come from destruction of our collagen and elastin

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.380
which is natural fibers that hold up the scaffolding of our skin

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.840
so with age the cells that secrete collagen

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.020
they're called fibroblasts they stop producing as much

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.800
and what the Sun does is it breaks down the existing collagen and elastin we have

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.040
so fibroblasts really like to be stretched, they like to be pulled and collagen does that, that collagen matrix

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.760
so the Sun damages the collagen fibers leading to less stretch on fibroblasts

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.000
and less production of collagen

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.020
which means that you look a little more saggy

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:04.560
I know it's very depressing so sun protection helps the degradation of those collagen and elastin fibers

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.120
You know there are a lot of creams on the market that claim to be anti-aging

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.280
but the one that really works

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.360
is sunscreen

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.580
preventing ultraviolet light from hitting your skin is the best thing you can do

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.680
to avoid skin cancer and to avoid photo aging

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.820
So yeah. It's good advice. Use sunscreen.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.840
hey I'm on set for Jurassic world fallen

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.180
Kingdom and I'm here filming sci-fi test

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.190
lab where we try to recreate some

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.800
dinosaur parts out of machinery and test

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.440
them out so if you want to see that then
