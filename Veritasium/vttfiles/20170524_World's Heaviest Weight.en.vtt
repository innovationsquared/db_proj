00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.760
An apple weighs about 1 newton, the world record for jet engine thrust is 570,000 newtons.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.660
And the Saturn V rocket that launched people to the moon had a thrust of 33,360,000 newtons

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.120
But how can we measure forces this big accurately?

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.540
Well, we need to ask this guy.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.660
Hi my name is Rick Seifarth I'm a physical
scientist in the Mass and Force Group.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.820
Am I supposed to look at the camera?

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.440
Sure.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.940
Okay.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.780
You can look at anything you like.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:35.060
Rick manages a dead weight machine 
that can apply 4,448,222 newtons.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.060
Why such a strange number? Because that's
exactly equal to 1,000,000 pounds of force.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.380
There are twenty fifty thousand
pound increments in this machine

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.800
20 times 50 equals 1,000,000 pounds.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.940
Cumulatively that's 4.45 mega newton.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.440
Elsewhere in the world, are there larger 
masses that people have calibrated?

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.980
I ask that question to every visitor
we get and I've not gotten..

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.800
one response that says: yeah I know 
where bigger stuff is calibrated.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.260
So if I really want to go out
on a limb and brag I'll say

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.680
these are the largest mass objects ever calibrated.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:07.480
Anywhere

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.400
The machine works like this, below ground 
are the 20 carefully calibrated masses.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.800
Their weight is used to calibrate
force sensors also called

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.240
Force Transducers, in the lab upstairs.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.420
This is a one million pound capacity 4.45 mega newton,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.440
and this is 13.3 mega newtons,
three million pounds force.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.340
This is the biggest machine of it's type 
in the world, and obviously one of a kind.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.680
One of these,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.640
will be placed on the compression head right here.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.060
Then, a hydraulic ram in the attic starts to raise the green lifting frame

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.880
And once the force transducer 
contacts the red loading frame,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.300
well then it starts lifting the weights downstairs.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.700
And as the lifting frame continues
to rise, more and more of the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.480
50,000 pound weights become 
suspended by the force sensor.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.480
And since the weights create an 
accurately-known force,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.100
the readouts from the force transducer 
can be precisely calibrated.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.880
These devices are then sent out into the field.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.900
Well literally, there's a test stand that's
set up with one of these gizmos-

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.640
a force transducers - embedded
in the test stand somewhere.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.740
And so the rocket is fired up, perhaps ramped up, ramped down and those forces are monitored.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.800
You know, in the old movies you'd hear: "go to 104% of power." Well, how do they know it's 104% of power?

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.560
Because somebody's measured it somewhere.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.520
When it comes to minimizing uncertainty, these guys aren't messing around.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.740
This piece right here is approximately 50,036.27 pounds of mass.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.600
Approximately.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.160
Approximately, yes! [laughter]

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.640
Think about that for a moment.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.240
Each of these pieces has a mass equivalent to ten minivans,

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.160
and their exact value is known to within several American nickels.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.780
Just a few American nickels worth of difference?

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.480
Yeah.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.500
That tiny uncertainty is measured with respect to the very definition of the kilogram

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.240
using K20 - that's the United States fundamental mass standard.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.500
This is done by comparing combinations of known weights, starting with K20, with larger unknown weights,

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.160
gradually working up to larger and larger masses.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.220
For example, here a single 5-kilogram mass is compared to two 2s and a 1.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.840
At some point in this process, they convert and start working in pounds, going from 50-pound masses to 500 pounds,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.300
and then 2500 pounds. And then, using a scale in the floor, to reach 10,000 pounds and then 20,000,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.120
and finally 30,000 pounds.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.160
Combinations of these huge weights are then used to calibrate the 50,000-pound masses which form the weight stack.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.560
And we have to have that, because what we sell is the vertical force vector that's generated by these weights

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:04.340
hanging in a gravitational field. We sell that with an uncertainty attached to it of 0.0005%,

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:12.300
five parts per million, so that means at full one million pounds of applied force, we guarantee that to be accurate - if you will -

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.440
within five pounds.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.640
Not only does that mean the masses have to be accurately calibrated,

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.780
it also means the gravitational acceleration at this location has to be taken into account.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.920
It's actually slightly less than Earth's standard gravity, so an additional 600 pounds are required.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.780
Plus, the buoyant force must be counteracted,

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.560
since these masses displace 125 pounds of air,

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.100
a further 125 pounds must be added to reach a million pounds of force.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.620
What strikes me as kind of amazing is that, like, this machine needs to exist, in a way.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.520
When I would have thought about it, like how would Boeing measure its forces, I would have thought

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.860
OK, they just, you know, calibrate a device that works up to X but then they can, you know,

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.740
generalize. Well, generalize - you know what I mean, like - Yes!

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:06.500
There's an axiom that says "one physical test is worth a thousand expert opinions."

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.560
And that has proven itself time and again, particularly in the world of physical testing.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.240
If you're getting on an airplane that somebody has built, are you willing to accept a 10% uncertainty on these numbers

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.540
or do you want it to be - the uncertainty on these measurements to be down in the mud?
