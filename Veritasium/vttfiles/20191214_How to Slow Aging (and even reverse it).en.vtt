00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.900
This is a video about research into slowing the rate of aging

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.180
and extending the human lifespan.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.080
So, before I filmed this I wanted to know:

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.340
What do you guys generally think about such research?

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.860
And I made a Twitter poll

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.180
where I found that the majority of people were supportive and thought there should be more of it

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.300
but there were some important concerns and I want to address those here

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.420
at the beginning. I mean the most significant concern was:

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.500
if we're looking to extend human lifespan,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.620
does that just mean we'll have more

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.240
sick years where we'll be in bed with Alzheimer's?
Nobody wants that, and that was clear to me.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.100
But the professor that I was interviewing for this video, professor David Sinclair, points out

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.020
that as you get older the risk of horrible diseases, things like diabetes and cancer,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.940
and arthritis, all those sorts of things... it increases exponentially.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.900
And so, if this research is successful the whole point of it will be to

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.820
forestall those sorts of diseases.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.060
I mean, if you really are tackling aging,

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.780
then you should also see that those age-related diseases do not set in so quickly.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.240
So, the point of slowing aging and extending human lifespan

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.680
is to extend the healthy lifespan, also called the health span.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.580
The other concerns I saw were that people were saying:

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.940
"Well, this could be used only for the wealthy and increase inequality"

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.560
or "It could increase the population of the Earth causing..."

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.400
"...more garbage, more CO2. Where are the resources to feed all these people?".

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.260
I think these are valid concerns, but they're not part of the scope of this video.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.280
So if you want to discuss them in the comments, feel free, but the point of this video is to address:

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.940
can we slow aging in humans? Can we extend the lifespan and the health span?

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.800
And what does that look like? How do we do it?

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.140
Okay. So for this video I traveled up to the 'Bodega Marine Lab',

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.740
which is north of San Francisco and there I got to see some 'moon jellyfish'.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.780
Now what's fascinating about these 'moon jellyfishes' is that some people consider them immortal.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.400
How can that be?

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.660
So all these jellyfish have this complex life cycle

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.340
where they start off as a polyp,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.020
which is basically like a small sea anemone and then they'll go through a metamorphosis

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.100
and become a medusa. And the medusa stage is what we generally think of when we think about a jellyfish.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.800
And in most of these species the polyps are generally able to asexually reproduce,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.600
and they can regenerate if tissue is cut off of them or if they're damaged,

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.560
and they don't have any clear evidence of senescence, which is the term for biological aging.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.800
So they appear to have some degree of immortality.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.860
No one had reported their ability to do this until... I think this was 2015.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.260
So do 'moon jellyfish' hold the key to slowing aging and extending our lifespan?

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.400
Could they help us live forever?

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.200
Before I got into making this video, I would have put this sort of research in the same category as

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.820
downloading your brain, your consciousness into a computer. Like, I can see how maybe that would work

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.500
but I don't think we're anywhere near that.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.260
Because we don't even understand how the brain works or how memories are stored,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.460
so that seems like serious science fiction, so

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:28.180
I would have put, say, extending the human lifespan to 120, 150, and beyond in the same category,

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.920
but after reading professor Sinclair's book and doing an interview with him,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.080
I think it seems much more possible and in fact plausible

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.600
that we'll make some progress over controlling aging in our lifetimes.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.720
Now, if you want to slow aging, the first question you need to answer is:

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.000
Why do we age in the first place? I mean, what really is aging?

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.840
I've made a video in the past about telomeres.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.780
These are the end caps on your chromosomes. And every time a cell divides the telomere gets a bit shorter.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.600
So it was thought that these

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.960
telomeres are kind of like the tips of your shoelaces and they prevent the chromosome from fraying.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.480
But there are other signs in older bodies that you have old cells.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.620
There are an accumulation of things, they're called senescent cells.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:24.120
They're essentially these zombie-like cells that just go on living in your body and inflaming the cells around them.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.020
There's poor intercellular communication,

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.420
there's mitochondrial dysfunction, those are the powerhouses of the cell.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:38.760
There are these 8 or 9 different features of older cells and they are the hallmarks of aging.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.220
But the question is: are they the cause of aging,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.560
or are they kind of the result of a deeper root cause?

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.980
In the middle of the last century, the hypothesis was that

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.820
it was damage to our DNA, mutations to our DNA that happened over  the course of our lives

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.280
that led us to be older

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.360
But,

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.720
evidence since then has suggested that that is not really the case.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.800
I mean, you can take an adult cell,

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.260
and you can clone it into a new organism.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.860
And that organism appears to live about as long as non-cloned organisms of the same species.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.360
Now, the first sheep, Dolly the sheep, had a short lifespan. She died early.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.060
But cloned animals; you can now clone a monkey,

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.920
you can clone dogs, in fact Barbra Streisand, the actress, she cloned her dogs,

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.320
and they are expected to live a normal lifespan.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.780
So in that way it seems like all the information is still there in the DNA.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:43.220
So if we're not losing information in our DNA then what is the reason for aging?

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.040
Well, professor Sinclair suspects that it's a loss of information,

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.360
but not the information in our DNA, in our genome.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.680
No, professor Sinclair suspects that the loss of information is in our epigenome.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.280
So what is the epigenome?

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.580
Every cell in your body has the same DNA,

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.760
but, different cell types have different epigenomes.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.740
They have different ways of packaging that DNA,

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.360
coiling up, you know, a lot of it so that it's not read,

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.240
and leaving some parts of the DNA spooled out,

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.220
so it's easier to transcribe and turn into proteins and run that cell.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.780
So the epigenome is responsible for

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.040
turning on or turning off different parts of the DNA.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.500
The way it does that is with proteins called 'histones'

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.040
that, essentially, the DNA is wrapped on,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.360
and also things like methylation.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.940
So there's these chemical signaling markers which are placed on the DNA in certain positions.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:52.700
So the idea is: when your body is first forming, the epigenome is what tells your cells what type of cell to be.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.780
But as you get older,

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.900
professor Sinclair's hypothesis is that we are losing information in the epigenome.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.080
And that's important because if a skin cell

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.880
needs to remain a skin cell, that's the epigenome.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.220
And if you don't have the epigenome

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.140
the skin cell will forget what type of cell it is and it might turn into a brain cell,

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.260
which may not be that bad but if your brain turns into a skin cell

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.500
you've got a problem and I think that's largely what aging is.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.780
I've gotta say, there's some weird, hair patches, on my shoulder,

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.580
that have happened as I've gotten older.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.020
Is that a cell... doing the wrong thing?
Are those meant to be skin cells?

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.360
Are they're screwing up or is this just some... I don't know.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:37.680
No, no, weird stuff happens when you get older, right?
You start to get hair growing where it shouldn't:

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:43.020
ears, nose, back.
That's cells losing their identity, the cells go:

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.660
"I can't remember what I'm supposed to do, I'm not reading the right genes anymore."

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:51.080
So, the key to this sort of breakdown in the epigenome

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.840
is DNA damage?

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.180
Yeah, so when you go out in the sun, not like today,

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.780
but on a day where there's a lot of sun, you'll break your chromosomes.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:05.020
And in the effort that the cells go to to stick the chromosome back together,

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:10.080
note: the DNA isn't just flailing around, it's actually bundled up. The cell has to unwrap it,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.240
recruit proteins to help,

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.500
join it together, and then they have to go back and reset the structures.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.000
And that resetting of the epigenome

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.220
happens about 99%. That 1% is the aging process.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:34.440
So overtime, histones are not returned to the right places and DNA methylation is added in places where it shouldn't be.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:42.940
We can read that methylation pattern and I could tell you how old you are, exactly, and when you're even gonna die.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.500
How could you tell that?

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.480
Well, it's a clock, we call it the Horvath clock named after my good friend Steve Horvath,

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.620
and so these little chemicals that accumulate on the DNA like a plaque on the teeth,

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.880
we can read that and the more you have, the older you are; biologically.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.320
So you might only be 40,

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.100
you're younger than 40, of course but, you know, I'm 50 now,

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.520
but I might be biologically 60, actually I was.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.400
And I changed my life and then the test said I was biologically 31.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:16.480
I mean, one of the things I found really interesting was: you found a way to make mice age faster.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.740
So, how did you do that?

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:22.020
Well, the clock of aging is due to the loss of the information in the cell,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.340
and one way to accelerate that is to go break a chromosome.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.420
Instead of going in the sun we engineered a mouse where we could break its chromosomes.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:35.660
Not enough to cause mutations, the cells put the DNA back together, so we didn't lose any genetic information.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.680
But if we're right about the 'epigenetic information theory of aging',

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.200
those mice should get old and that's exactly what happened.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.980
It's gray, it's got a hunchback,

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.620
it's got dementia, all its organs look old,

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:54.080
but the real test was: "what if we measured that DNA clock?" what we call the 'DNA methylation clock'.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:59.680
And we measured it and those mice were actually 50% older than mice that we didn't treat.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.600
So that isn't just a mouse that looks old, that mouse literally is older.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.980
What's interesting about this hypothesis is that, if it's true,

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:12.860
if the noise accumulating the epigenome is really what's causing aging,

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.300
well then there are steps we can take right now

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.240
to slow the rate of aging in our bodies,

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.420
by trying to better maintain our epigenomes.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.920
So how do we do that?

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.120
There's this theory, that billions of years ago

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.760
early bacteria took an important evolutionary step.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.800
They actually developed two different modes of living.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.920
When times were good they used their energy to grow and reproduce.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:46.480
But when conditions were tough, they used their energy to protect and repair their cells.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:50.380
They evolved, what professor Sinclair calls: 'longevity genes'.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:57.640
These genes triggered by adversity create enzymes which among other things, maintain the epigenome.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:03.660
And today, those same longevity genes can be found in bacteria, and us.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.920
We have these 'hormetic response' genes or 'longevity genes' that are in all of our cells,

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.840
and they sense when we've run a lot, we've lost our breath or we're hungry,

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.260
we are a little bit hot, or a little bit cold.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.120
These genes are turning on our general defenses against aging. So, what is that?

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.880
So, parts of our cells fall apart: they can put them back together.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.800
Proteins misfold: they can get rid of them or put them back together.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.420
The ends of the chromosomes get shorter: they can lengthen them.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.040
A lot of processes that go on but one of the most important, I think,

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.740
is maintaining the information, the epigenetic information in the cell,

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.840
so that our cells don't forget what to do.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.040
There are three types of longevity gene.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.420
There are the ones we work on called 'sirtuins' and they control the information in the cell.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:51.820
In fact, 'sir' in sirtuin stands for 'silent information regulator' number two (SIR2).

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:56.460
There are other ones. The other group is called AMP-kinase or AMPK.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:01.960
This group of genes senses how much energy we're taking in... mostly in the form of sugar.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.200
And then the third group is called mTOR.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:09.400
And these genes control and respond to how much amino acids we're taking in.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:14.360
So if you eat a giant steak, you've got a lot of amino acids coming into your body.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:19.580
That'll actually prevent mTOR from hunkering down and keeping you being longer lived.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.300
So the mouse experiments actually bear this out.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:27.860
The best way to make a mouse live longer is to reduce the amount of time it eats,

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.200
so periodic fasting, intermittent fasting,

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.600
to keep it a little bit cool,

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.980
and to restrict its amino acids.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.140
That's the recipe for long life for a mouse, and it's true for monkeys as well,

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.500
that have been calorie restricted studies where

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:47.160
these monkeys for 15 years didn't eat as much food as the ones that gorged themselves whenever they wanted.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.120
And they were protected. They didn't just age slower.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.160
They didn't get as much diabetes and heart disease, they were actually fit and healthy,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.460
when the control group, eating whatever they wanted, aged and became sick quicker.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.200
When some people think about eating less,

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.960
like, calorie restriction as a way to extend their life.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:10.620
That doesn't seem like a very pleasant way to extend life. I mean, to be hungry for longer...

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:16.120
So are there other ways to... you know, mimic that effect? Or to simulate that?

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:20.400
There are these molecules that turn on the sirtuin pathway,

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:27.360
and trick the body. And so, for example, in the lab if I give some of our mice a molecule called 'NMN',

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:31.520
which raises the level of a chemical called 'NAD',

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.320
you get hyperactive defenses in the body.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:39.140
And what did you see in these... 'senescent mice' that you gave NMN to?

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.980
Well, we had a bit of an incident. These mice that we gave NMN to ran 50% further,

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:49.600
but actually some of them ran so far that the machine, the little treadmill, stopped working.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.500
And we had to reprogram the software

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:55.800
because this program had never seen a mouse that ran more than three kilometers.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.320
Three kilometers for a mouse?

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.100
For an old mouse. They outran the young mice.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.340
And that's like an ultramarathon for us?

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:10.180
That would be probably like taking a 70 year-old and making them run faster than a 20 year-old; further.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.380
Yes, so these are ultra marathoners,

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:17.740
and if we did that to humans I imagine you could have 90 year-olds winning Olympic medals.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:23.040
So to sum up, there are six things that you can do right now to slow the rate of your aging.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.280
Starting with zero: avoid DNA damage.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.440
Wear sunscreen, avoid x-rays and all that sort of stuff.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.880
Number one: eat less. Caloric restriction.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:39.640
Number two: eat less protein, because your body has ways of detecting how much of that you're taking in.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.060
Number three: do some exercise.
'High-intensity interval training' (HIIT).

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:47.820
Get your heart rate up to 85%, make your body feel like you're running from a lion or something.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.700
Number four: be uncomfortably cold,

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.020
or number five: be uncomfortably hot.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:15:01.900
All of these things will trigger your body's 'longevity genes' into maintaining your epigenome.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:08.000
Going into 'repair and protect mode' rather than 'grow and reproduce', and if you think about those things,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.020
those are generally all the things that we don't do.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.780
But what if slowing aging isn't enough for you?

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.640
Well, this is where my interview with professor Sinclair took an interesting turn,

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:23.420
because he's actually done some research on reversing aging.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.320
So how would you do that?

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:31.080
Well, effectively, you would need to take the epigenome and reset it back to an earlier time.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.980
But how is that possible?

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:40.640
Back in 2012, a scientist named Yamanaka received the Nobel Prize for discovering four factors,

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.620
which when applied in a gene therapy to an adult cell,

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:50.640
would reset the whole epigenome back to how that cell was when it was an embryo.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.480
So it is what is called a 'pluripotent stem cell'.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:58.360
Now, you wouldn't want to apply that to your entire body because,

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:03.280
well, then you would turn into a giant tumor because your cells wouldn't know how to differentiate.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:08.120
But it does suggest that there are ways of resetting your epigenome,

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.880
and they could be the key to reversing aging.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.800
The big breakthrough that we just had in my lab,

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.820
finally, you know, about a year or so ago,

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:19.460
was to reprogram the eye of a mouse.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:23.460
And the eye, we chose the eye because that's a very hard thing to fix, right?

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.699
If you go blind when you're older, we think that's a one-way thing,

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.960
you're never going to recover your vision,

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.260
but we decided: let's try it anyway, let's go for broke.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.260
So we put our gene therapy in the eye of old mice,

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.760
turn their retinas to be young again, reversed aging in their retinas.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.180
So those one-year old mice went back to about two months,

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:47.140
And guess what? Those mice could see again, just like they were young again.

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:53.480
How do you reset one of these eye cells without resetting it to just a stem cell?

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:59.120
Well, we have to be very careful not to reset these cells to be basically a stem cell,

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:04.200
otherwise, we wouldn't have mice that can see, we'd have mice with a giant tumor in the back of their eyes.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.200
So what we do is a couple of things:

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:11.080
we didn't use all of the four reprogramming factors that won the Nobel Prize, we use just three,

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.120
we leave off one called 'cMyc', which causes cancer,

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:21.500
and those three seem to be just the right recipe for taking the age of the eye backwards, but not too far.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.740
Then, the second thing we do is: we turn it off.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:27.360
We can actually turn this system 'on' when we want, and 'off' again,

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.340
so that we don't take them too far back in age.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.340
Can you do that with any cell?

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:37.440
We think we can do this in any tissue. We've now given it to the whole mouse and those mice are fine.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.640
No evidence of cancer. They seem to be really quite healthy.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:46.600
So the big question is: can you take a mouse way back, the whole body, and be totally younger?

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:51.600
Maybe back from two years, back to two months. And that's what we're doing right now.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.540
That's pretty exciting!

00:17:53.559 --> 00:17:56.240
It's freakishly exciting, actually!

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.540
I thought we'd just slow down aging, now we're talking about an aging reset.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.920
You know what? We've only reset the age of the eye once,

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:07.520
But how many times can we do this? Maybe it's twice. Maybe it's a hundred times.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:14.860
So, professor Sinclair claims that his gene therapy reversed aging in the mouse's eye and allowed it to see again.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:21.860
But applying a gene therapy to every one of your trillion cells is pretty impossible.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:26.700
So in order for this to actually work and reset an entire body,

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:31.480
you would need another way, and this is where the jellyfish come in,

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:37.520
because 'moon jellyfish'—any cell in an adult jellyfish can actually be reset

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:42.920
into an earlier stage of its life cycle. It can become a polyp again.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:50.220
So it seems like the jellyfish are actually capable of activating something like the Yamanaka factors

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:54.760
and resetting their epigenomes to an earlier time in their lives.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.140
If we were able to figure out how they do that,

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:01.220
well, then maybe we could do the same with our own cells.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:04.500
We do have the ability to reset our epigenomes,

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:08.580
but that is typically only used when we're in the embryonic stage,

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.580
when we need to maintain all our cells as stem cells.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.760
As we age, most mammals including humans,

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.860
we lose stem cells over time.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.300
And the stem cells we do have become more and more restricted over time

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.420
to the types of cells they can make.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:29.000
So if we can understand how the 'moon jellyfish' can take, presumably, many different kinds of cells,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.340
and reverse-engineer them into the cells it needs during regeneration,

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.480
that might give us an idea of how to do it in ourselves, as well.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:43.160
So, I still think we're a fair ways off from reversing aging in the entire human body.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:48.520
But what I found interesting from talking to professor Sinclair was that there's at least a roadmap.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.440
At least a path ahead where you can see

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:56.240
that it could be possible to slow and even reverse aging.
