00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.620
This spike we place right in next to the dorsal
fin.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.939
That is the pinger.

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:13.179
&gt;&gt; And you put it on that bone behind your
ear.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.780
You can hear it pinging.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.620
&gt;&gt; Oh, man.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.620
Oh.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.230
It is quite high pitched.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.080
It sounds like a really high pitched bird
chirping in your ear.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.330
&gt;&gt; The sound given off by the tag that will
on that a frequency of 69 kilohertz, but then

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.010
each tag has its own specific frequency space
ID.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.480
&gt;&gt; So using underwater microphones you can
hear when different sharks are nearby.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.120
There is a little yellow buoy out there which
actually has a little tracker on it.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.190
So every time a tagged shark swims by...

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.400
This is like the shark not checking in.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.400
&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.840
It is like a shark checking in.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.700
And over here {?} then it connects to a satellite.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.940
&gt;&gt; And it emails us, lets us know.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.940
&gt;&gt; At home when the shark is here.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.980
&gt;&gt; And at the same time we also hope to get
a tissue sample from the shark that we tag.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.730
&gt;&gt; Why is that important to grab a tissue
sample?&gt;&gt;

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.960
A couple of studies we are doing are looking
at the genetic populations of the different

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.960
sharks of the world.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.310
Even in Australia we are finding they are
too different than any populations.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.569
Also we can work out what the shark has been
eating recently by its tissue.

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:17.569
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:20.119
But before you can tag a shark you have to
entice it close to the boat.

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.222
Well it is morning and we are just about to
have breakfast, but I thought I would come

00:01:23.222 --> 00:01:26.360
out and have a look at the shark’s breakfast.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.770
Yeah, that is what we are going to be leaking
overboard to attract the shark’s to our

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.770
cages.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.649
We just threw the bait in and waited about
two minutes and a shark came up and grabbed

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:37.649
it.

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.829
I was trying to fill the seagulls around the
bay when it hit.

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.659
It was incredible, just unbelievable to see
how fast they arrived here.

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.220
So the sharks are here and they are biting.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.299
The goal was not to feed the sharks, but to
pull the bait away from them before they can

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.670
get it.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.950
Oh, man.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.479
That is a big shark.

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:11.560
As a storm rolled in, it was my chance to
observe the sharks on their own terms underwater.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.110
I am just trying to make a nice seal with
my mask so I don’t get any water in.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.079
That means heaps of Vaseline on my moustache.

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.200
It feels disgusting.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.370
&gt;&gt; Today we have got pretty stormy weather
and the sharks are fired up a bit.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.519
This is the whether that suits them for predation
with the sea lions.

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.120
&gt;&gt; I would say good for us.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.860
We are all cold and wet, but yeah, good conditions
for the sharks.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.900
[ multiple voices ]

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.900
&gt;&gt; This is gross.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:38.900
You are using like half the tub on me.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.849
That is how it is going to be.

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.390
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:56.230
&gt;&gt; There is a storm front coming through.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:13.150
Sharks are fired up for you.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.790
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.760
From the cage you can see the sharks that
have already been tagged.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:33.610
And you get a different perspective on what
it is like to pull food away from a shark’s

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.599
mouth.

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.439
In real time you can see just how fast they
can strike.

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:46.060
That was a pretty incredible surreal experience.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.349
You just drop in there and it is a whole other
world.

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.629
And it is funny, you don’t really feel scared
of them, just, I don’t know, maybe it is

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:54.629
the cage.

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.879
But they just look so docile and peaceful.

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.310
So hard is it to stick one of those in the
dorsal fin?

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:09.650
&gt;&gt; If I can get a shark in really close and
get the right shot, they make it pretty easy

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:21.310
when they swim past the back of the boat.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.930
The platform here.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.550
&gt;&gt; There it is.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:33.170
&gt;&gt; They have to be going slightly going away
and they have to turn to present, so...

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.720
&gt;&gt; Come on.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.840
Come on.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.390
Oh.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.500
With the light fading, tagging was put on
hold until tomorrow.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.450
And that gave me a chance to talk to the researchers
about why this research is so important.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.730
&gt;&gt; Before protection they were hunted for
sport.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.140
They were hunted for their jaws and they are
hunted just out of fear.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.010
&gt;&gt; Everybody was scared of sharks.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.030
&gt;&gt; You know, the Jaws movie, the Jaws phenomenon.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.230
It created an awful lot of fear of these animals.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.560
&gt;&gt; Sharks were mindless killers.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.420
&gt;&gt; And people just wanted them out of the
ocean.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.550
The population on has basically crashed.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.710
&gt;&gt; And this research is essential to help
their numbers recover.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.110
&gt;&gt; We have to find out how many sharks are
out there.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.310
We have to find out where they travel to,
where they breed.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.380
That is one of the holy grails that no one
knows.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.440
Where do they give birth?

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.440
We don’t know that either.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.570
No one has ever seen them breeding.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.450
No one has ever seen them giving birth.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.360
And if you can’t protect sharks in those
key areas, then you are not going to really

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:41.860
be able to have much of an impact across the
population as a whole.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:06:02.600
&gt;&gt; That is great for science.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:25.790
&gt;&gt; You know, we be have begin to scratch the
surface with satellite tagging.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.340
We always thought white sharks were a coastal
species.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.470
We have found that they are able to do dives
well over a kilometer deep.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.810
They frequently dive off of the edge of the
continental shelf.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.830
They go in and inhabit niches out in the open
ocean for months and months and months on

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.830
end.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.040
So this whole myth that they are this coastal
creature has been completely debunked with

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.590
the advent of this new technology.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:52.910
It is one of those things where these animals
are... if you ask a question and you conduct

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.190
your research and you answer your question
and then you have five more questions that

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.000
have arisen from that answer, so that is...
yeah.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.090
There is obviously there is a lot more to
learn.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.400
Veritasium is supported by Audible.com, a
leading provider of audio books with over

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:21.680
This week I wanted to recommend a book called
Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.770
by James Gleick.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.960
He is one of my all time favorite authors,
so you should really check it out.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.180
In fact, you can download it for free by going
to Audible.com/Veritasium.
