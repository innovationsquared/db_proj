00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
A question I get asked surprisingly often is, is Veritasium a real element?

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.090
Nope, I made it up.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.760
*having fun*

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:15.298
When I was a kid about 10 or 11 years old

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.159
I went to this Genghis Khan exhibit at a museum, and I didn't know much about Genghis Khan except

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.010
he was some famous warrior who lived a long time ago

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.649
So I was thinking maybe we'd see his mummified body or his suit of armor or his sword something like that

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.250
But when I got to the museum all they had were like these tiny

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.739
fragments of pottery, and some old shoes, and I was incredibly disappointed

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.500
So in this video, I want to tell you my story but with real pieces of my life

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.520
*4-year old Derek*: Hi!

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.840
*4-year old Derek*: Hi!

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:54.200
Real photons that bounced off my face hit a sensor, created a current that created a magnetic field - flipping some domains on magnetic tape

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:00.779
which was later replayed, recreating the current, passed into a computer, digitized into zeros and ones, beamed to your device, which

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.419
recreates the light that's hitting your eyes right now

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.220
*4-Year old Derek*: I'm waiting for you to take a picture

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.820
*Derek's Dad* : Of what?

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.400
*4-Year old Derek*: Of me!

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.320
Now there is a direct path of particles from my four-year-old face to yours right now

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.069
and there is nothing you can do to undo that. I grew up in Vancouver Canada. So I'm mostly Canadian

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.540
Mostly because my family was South African

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.440
*Stereotypical South African Montage*

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.800
After my parents got married they moved to Vancouver where my two older sisters were born

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.410
But I was born in Australia

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.600
And that's because my dad was working there as an engineer at a pulp and paper mill at the time

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.630
This is the first house where I ever lived I lived there for the first 18 months of my life

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.669
Soon after my family returned to Canada and I guess I was a competitive kid

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.249
Because I graduated top of my class and had a full scholarship to go and study engineering at Queen's University

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.329
The problem was I didn't really want to be an engineer

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.689
I wanted to be a filmmaker but, there isn't a straightforward path to becoming a filmmaker like there is for

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.360
Becoming an engineer or a doctor or a lawyer.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.470
Plus your chance of success at filmmaking is very low

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.130
Especially in the year 2000 when your best bet is probably to become a PA and try to catch a break somewhere

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.310
It didn't feel like a meritocracy or like your life was in your own hands

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.920
So, what did I do? Well, I did the smart thing. I took the scholarship and completed a degree in engineering physics

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.500
*Friend*: It's starting to get power

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.960
*college Derek*: Winderrific

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.560
You know some people seem to think it's strange to have interests in both science and film, but to me

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.869
They are both incredible ways of getting at the truth

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.380
I mean film records everything exactly as it happens and it never changes so it's like this perfect

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.800
Observation so you can't fool yourself later like about how I felt stifled by four years of engineering

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.440
*Post engineering Derek*: I feel like I've been stifled by four years of engineering.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.860
Now while I was at college I did take a few film production courses as many as I could squeeze into my engineering timetable

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:23.500
My final project was a film about someone who is really good at math, but really wants to be an artist

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.840
*laughs* So that's really painfully autobiographical

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.420
I also made videos with my engineering friends, but they always wanted to do something with a gimmick,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.500
like vampires, ninjas, Bigfoot, pirates

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.000
The videos weren't very good and we didn't even post them to YouTube. Why not?

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.910
Well because YouTube didn't exist yet

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.579
so after the engineering degree

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:57.389
I decided to move to Australia and go to film school see the Lonely Planet guide and the film school application on my desk

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.439
*2004 Derek*: I'm leaving in five days, and I've done barely anything to get ready

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.010
But once I got to Australia

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.740
I figured I needed to get a job and get some film experience before I could make a decent application

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:16.820
I mean they weren't just gonna accept this Canadian engineer with some ridiculous videos; and on my sixth day in the country,

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:24.420
I auditioned for and got a role in this play at the University of Sydney and then I started asking around about physics tutoring work and

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.960
Within a couple weeks, I had enrolled in a PhD in the School of Physics

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.860
*Derek doing PhD*: So it seems like a kind of funny place to be in given that I came here to do film but,

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:44.640
after a short time I realized how much I still liked learning and how much I liked physics and I was hoping that I could meld the two, physics and film

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.200
In a PhD about how to make films that actually teach physics.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.180
Now, I know that sounds incredibly relevant now

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.280
But at the time it didn't really satisfy either of my passions in physics or film

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:03.900
I know because this is me the night the data first starts coming in from students watching videos that contain misconception

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.900
*Derek doing PhD*I just think that you know

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.339
including extra material that is wrong and stuff into multimedia segments is just something that

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.370
no one's ever gonna really put time and energy into and

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:21.059
It's never really gonna be worth much and that sort of pisses me off and I wish I was doing something a bit more practical

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.899
After I got my PhD, I applied to the film school

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.780
*Derek post Phd*: Now I feel like I'm ready to become an after student

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.840
and got rejected. I got rejected again the next year

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.100
I applied twice to the drama school, but never made it past callbacks

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.510
I was looking for that well-defined path toward a creative career

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.760
but failing at that I did the smart thing and I took a job as the head of science at a tutoring company

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.099
where I'd been teaching during my PhD they were making motors and it was a great job

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.129
I love the students and the other teachers and the flexibility. I had the pay was great

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:02.580
and so at the end of 2010 my friends were a bit confused when I told them I was quitting full-time work to start a

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.089
YouTube channel, but I guess I had reached a kind of breaking point

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:13.020
I was 28 years old and I'd spent my whole life up to then building backup plans and doing the things that were most likely

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.170
to succeed

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.330
Engineering and a PhD and teaching and I wanted to make this shift

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.719
It was like a shift in life philosophy towards pursuing

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.570
Wholeheartedly the things that I felt to be true

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:30.420
the things that I'd always told myself I wanted to do, the things I told myself I wanted to be, I wanted to aim for

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.670
That and not just something that was safe a good strategic decision in the moment

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.580
So is veritasium a real element?

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.280
Well for me it was! it was that idea

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.360
That I wanted to pursue things, I felt to be true

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.489
Now you think that this would be the triumphant moment from which I'd never look back

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:56.720
but the truth is it I wasn't very good at making youtube videos

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.100
*Derek teaching*: It attracts any object with mass

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:04.919
Towards any other object with mass  *I was stiff*  an online science video blog

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.960
*My presentation style was unnatural and the pacing was slow*

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:16.650
Fiji water has been recommended to me by a friend for example the mass of the Sun

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:22.799
*Present Derek*: Sometimes I think it's a blessing not to know how bad you are because if I had known I probably would have quit

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.340
But I didn't and so I kept working at it and after a couple of years

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:32.249
Well, I started making enough money on YouTube that I could stop doing all other work

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:38.460
So YouTube became my main source of livelihood and from that point on

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:43.679
I've done  so many amazing things that I never could have imagined

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.169
and the greatest adventure by far is

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:54.660
one that I haven't told you about but it's when I moved to LA and met a girl and fell in love and

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.400
*Derek*: Will you marry me?

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:03.860
*laughs, happiness*

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.180
*Mrs. Derek*: Yes!

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:09.600
Yes!

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.860
And here we are

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.240
*Derek jr*: Fly drone!

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.180
Gonna fly the drone gonna go outside

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:26.420
Now my ability to do what I love every day is

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:29.958
All thanks to you and I know that may sound cheesy

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.400
but it is absolutely, true that

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.280
Every video view and like and comment and share

00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:44.179
All of that great stuff is what has made veritasium and by extension my life possible. So

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:52.850
Seriously, thank you. And I guess I owe a debt of gratitude to YouTube because they've made possible something that was

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.689
unimaginable in the year 2000 when I graduated from

00:08:56.939 --> 00:09:03.379
From high school and it still didn't exist in 2004 when I graduated from college and I think about the people who are currently in

00:09:03.379 --> 00:09:10.938
high school and college and I think well the job that you will have may not have been invented yet or

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:18.768
You may invent it. So what is the point of my story is it to say if you follow your dreams anything is possible?

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.600
Hardly, because I'm all too aware of the survivor bias

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.620
That is if you look at the subset of people who are successful at a particular thing

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.679
well, you're kind of ignoring all the experience of the

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.219
Many more people who did not manage to succeed

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:39.199
So when I see actors talking about just you know, pursue your dreams and you can do anything

00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:44.899
It feels really wrong. Like there's this statistical bias in it

00:09:45.329 --> 00:09:52.609
but at the same time I feel like there's a paradox to the survivor bias because the one thing you know about the people who

00:09:52.889 --> 00:09:54.889
Survived are that they...

00:09:55.559 --> 00:09:57.559
attempted in the first place that they

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.110
ignored the logical choice

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.599
That, you know, survivor bias would have you believe never try something which is statistically unlikely

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.660
They ignored that and they went for it anyway

00:10:08.819 --> 00:10:14.299
So I guess my advice is if there is something you feel you really want to do

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:20.590
Then you should at least try it and accept that there is a very high probability of failure

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:25.780
but better to try than the alternative where you face certain failure

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.009
Now having kids definitely makes it harder to make videos

00:10:30.009 --> 00:10:30.880
*Pre-tantrum*

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:35.169
Mainly because I want to spend all my time playing with them and not say, editing

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:40.000
So thank you for being patient as the pace of video uploads has slowed to a crawl

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:45.879
But you know having kids has also made me re-evaluate the types of videos

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:50.619
I want to be making and what I want to be doing with my time, you know

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:54.940
This idea of veritasium was an idea where I wanted to

00:10:55.370 --> 00:11:02.080
Focus on the things I really wanted to accomplish and go straight for those. I think that's a decision

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:07.119
You don't just make once but you have to keep making and keep reevaluating and that's what I'm doing

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:11.530
Trying to decide exactly what I want to do next for veritasium

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:15.760
if you've got any ideas leave them in the comments below and

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:21.340
Thank you for sticking with me as this channel and I evolve
