00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.780
This is the final installment of the beaker
ball balance problem.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.740
So if you haven’t seen the first part, you
should probably watch that now.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.700
The link is in the description.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.309
Now assuming you have seen it, you know that
the balance tips towards the hanging acrylic

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.160
ball when weighed against a beaker with a
submerged ping pong ball.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.940
But what would happen if, instead of tethering
the ping pong ball to the base of the beaker,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.120
it was instead submerged by my finger.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.070
I posed this question in the last video and
you responded with thousands of comments.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.450
Thirteen percent of you thought that the acrylic
ball beaker would be heavier.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.410
Twenty-nine percent thought the ping pong
ball beaker would be heavier.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.820
And 54 percent of you thought that they would
be balanced.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:53.660
So now let’s see what actually happens in
three, two, one.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.280
Perfectly balanced.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.460
But why is this the case?

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.970
Well, just as in the previous experiment,
both balls displaced the same amount of water

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.049
and so they experienced the same upward buoyant
force equal to the weight of water they displace.

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.380
Therefore, there are equal and opposite downward
forces on the water, making both beakers heavier

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.110
by this amount.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.640
And our answer could stop here.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.299
But if you are wondering why this result is
different from the previous case, consider

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.109
that in the first part, the downward force
on the ping pong ball side was counteracted

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:26.689
by the upward tension in the string.

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.970
But not any more, because there is no string.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.869
Instead, the downward force from my hand is
equal to the buoyant force minus the weight

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.329
of the ping pong ball.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.070
So that overall both beakers get heavier by
the same amount.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.569
It is just the weight of water displaced by
the ping pong ball or the acrylic ball because

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.189
it has the same volume.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.439
I hope you enjoyed this experiment.

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:55.500
If you have got another way of explaining
this, please let me know in the comments.
