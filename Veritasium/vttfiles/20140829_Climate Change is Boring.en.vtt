00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.830
Climate change is boring.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.660
Don’t get me wrong.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.830
It is incredibly important.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.790
It is just that the story of climate change
is not especially compelling.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.460
And that is when the carbon dioxide concentration
reached 400 parts per million.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.609
When I started making this video I thought
that everyone knew the story.

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.199
But apparently I was wrong.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.619
What do you feel about climate change?

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.570
&gt;&gt; So I think Australia is the most affected
by the climate change.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.730
That is because, I would say, there are some
layers and layers... a hole in those layers.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.510
I think, I reckon, yeah?

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.420
&gt;&gt; And whereas before there used to be a natural
layer up there that blocks things...

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.870
&gt;&gt; That layer seems to be getting...

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.080
&gt;&gt; It is ... it is... thinner out.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.080
Thinner something?

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.080
&gt;&gt; Thinner, yeah.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.620
&gt;&gt; And so more heat is coming down.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.620
&gt;&gt; The ozone layer and therefore our seasons
are changing.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.640
&gt;&gt; The hole in the ozone layer is causing
a problem.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.770
&gt;&gt; Ok, the hole in the ozone layer is a problem,
but it is not a major cause of climate change.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.660
To recap, we are burning fossil fuels, releasing
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.570
traps slightly more thermal energy, causing
the overall temperature of the planet to rise.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.470
&gt;&gt; Have you changed anything about your life
because climate change is happening?&gt;&gt;

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.720
I recycle now.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.090
&gt;&gt; We recycle more.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.570
&gt;&gt; We recycle a lot in England.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.570
&gt;&gt; In England, yeah.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.170
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah, we do more things like recycling.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.170
&gt;&gt; Recycling.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.170
&gt;&gt; Recycling.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.690
Recycling plastic and paper.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.280
&gt;&gt; Just putting plastics in the right bin
and paper in the right bin and stuff like

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.280
this.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.770
&gt;&gt; Ok, again, recycling is very important,
but it is not really going to reduce greenhouse

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.010
gas emissions which come mainly from energy
use and transportation.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.810
So what I have learned is lots of people don’t
know how climate change works and don’t

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.110
know what to do about it.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.420
What’s worse is there is so much confusion
that some people don't think humans are responsible.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.210
&gt;&gt; I am a doubter.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.049
&gt;&gt; What does that mean?

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.369
&gt;&gt; It means I don’t know whether it is or
it isn’t truth.

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.780
&gt;&gt; You get so many conflicting opinions on
it they all seem to be coming from reputable

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.780
sources.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.970
&gt;&gt; Here is the thing.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.740
The vast majority of climate scientists agree
that climate change is happening and that

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.990
humans are playing a significant role.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.990
But the public doesn’t see this broad consensus
because, well, there are arguments made to

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.830
the contrary by businesses with vested interests,
those who stand to lose if a price is put

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.110
on carbon.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.810
Now these people will make up stories, whatever
they want, things like Al Gore and his pals

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.280
just invented climate change in order to make
themselves rich and famous.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.160
Meanwhile the scientists respond with carefully
worded predictions.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.970
That would result in a rising of temperature
of between 1.4 and 2.6 degrees Celsius, that

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.099
is, within a 90 percent confidence interval,
by the year 2050.

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.660
I don’t want to listen to this story again.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.959
This is why scientists have had such a tough
time informing the public about climate change.

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.500
It is much easier to tell a compelling story
if you can make up whatever you want than

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.610
if you have to stick to the truth.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.980
Climate change is like Armageddon.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.780
Just instead of a giant earth crushing asteroid
it is slightly more of an invisible, odorless

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.250
gas.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.030
And instead of the immanent destruction of
the planet, it is a gradual warming over decades.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.060
See, our brains are well adapted to deal with
clear and present danger.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.750
They are not so good at handling complex,
long term, probabilistic forecasts, which

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.890
is kind of why we have governments.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.840
They are meant to act in our best interest,
especially in the case of complex, long term

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.840
problems.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.220
And, in fact, last year the Australian government
implemented a carbon tax, which seemed to

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.220
be working great.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.700
It was reducing carbon emissions.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.880
And then this year they repealed that carbon
tax, the first government in the world to

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.410
do something like that.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.930
And my question is: Why?

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.180
You know, there is a UN climate summit coming
up next month and you can actually win a trip

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.630
to go there and ask your questions to the
world leaders.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.950
If you are between the ages of 13 and 21,
head over to AskWhyWHyNot.org where you can

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.599
submit a one minute video asking why, why
not questions, like: Why would you scrap a

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.730
carbon tax that was working?

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.180
Why not join the rest of the world in putting
a price on carbon?I mean, the real reason

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.590
I find climate change boring is because we
know what the problem is.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.699
The science is well established.

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.830
And the solutions are fairly obvious.

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.210
And yet action is not being taken.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.449
So if you feel like I do, perhaps you should
take some action and maybe we can change this

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:42.000
story and make it a little bit more interesting.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.940
This video was sponsored by the Climate Reality
Project, but it really opened my eyes because

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.120
I really thought we already all knew the facts.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.210
But clearly we don’t.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.440
So maybe we need to spend more time educating
the people around us.
