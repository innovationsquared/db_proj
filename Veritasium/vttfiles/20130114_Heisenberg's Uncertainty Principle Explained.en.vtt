00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.520
Today I am doing an experiment that demonstrates
Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.330
Sao her I have a green laser and I am firing
it down towards the front of the room through

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.780
a narrow slit.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.920
Now that slit can be adjusted so it can be
made narrower or wider.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.230
And the laser spot is projected on to a screen
behind it.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.510
So what do you think is going to happen to
this spot on the screen as I narrow the slit?

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.730
Well, let’s have a look.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.619
You see exactly what you would expect.

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.630
The spot gets narrower and narrower.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.490
The sides are getting cut off by the slit.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.660
It makes complete sense.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.340
And if you stop there you would never realize
that Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.550
is at work.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.540
But if you keep going something strange happens.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.420
As you make the slit ever narrower the spot
starts to spread out.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.020
Isn’t that incredible?

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.370
You are making the slit narrower, and yet
the spot on the wall is getting wider.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.100
The narrower you make it, the wider that spot
on the wall becomes.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.049
To understand this we have to look at Heisenberg’s
Uncertainty Principle.

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.690
Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle is normally
written as delta x, delta p is greater than

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.570
or equal to h on four pi.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.570
So what does this mean?

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.600
Well, it is about the position and the momentum
of a particle.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.289
So x is the position of the particle and p
is its momentum.

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:32.579
So delta x is the uncertainty in position
and delta p is the uncertainty in the momentum.

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.900
Now if you multiply those two quantities together
they must always be greater than or equal

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.909
to h on four pi.

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.679
Now h is Planck’s Constant.

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.270
And that deserves a video all to itself, like
this one by 60 Symbols.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.189
But for our purposes it is just a very small
number.

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.659
So in our every day lives we don’t come
up against this uncertainty relation, because

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.069
everything is much, much bigger than h.

00:01:54.069 --> 00:02:00.109
But as we narrowed the slit we were decreasing
delta x for those photons.

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:04.740
So we were getting more and more precise about
where the photons were passing through that

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.860
slit.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.650
And in a certain point you come to this limit
so that if you narrow this any further, you

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.700
are going to break this uncertainty relationship.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.390
So what needs to happen is the uncertainty
of momentum needs to go up.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.459
I should specify this is uncertainty in momentum
in the x direction, in the horizontal direction.

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.849
So if before photons were going perfectly
straight, now they must veer off to the left

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.090
or the to the right to ensure that we don’t
break Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.819
And the more you decrease your uncertainty
in position, the more narrow you make that

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.230
slit, the more the uncertainty in momentum
has to go up.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.760
And so if these photons are going to the left
and the right, .that is going to produce a

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.010
might wider beam.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.120
It is really, really non intuitive, but it
is the way the world works.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.909
&gt;&gt; It must be the sun playing tricks with
my mind.

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:08.209
&gt;&gt; What about.... this is really going to
test you, right?

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.000
[ multiple voices ]

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.070
I have got to say a big thank you to Professor
Walter Lewin at MIT.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.549
He inspired me to make this video.

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.579
And I also have to say a big thanks to the
University of Sydney for letting me use their

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.400
equipment and especially to Tom and Ralph
for helping me set this all up.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.520
Oh, and just one more thing.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.370
I should point out that this explanation of
the experiment is slightly controversial,

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.250
at least in that Henry from Minute Physics
and I have been debating whether it is really

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.340
that counter intuitive.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.739
I mean, if you see light as a wave, then all
light is doing here is defracting.

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.430
That is the phenomenon where if a wave passes
through the slit it bends at the corners and

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.860
radiates out in all directions.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.340
And that explains the spreading of the beam.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.980
But that goes to the very nature of light.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.069
Is it made of waves or particles?

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.400
That is something that I would like to explore
in the coming weeks.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.810
So stay tuned for that.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.569
But Henry has an excellent video about Heisenberg’s
Uncertainty Principle, which I think makes

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.400
it more intuitive and less spooky.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.370

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:11.480
It is a really good video.
