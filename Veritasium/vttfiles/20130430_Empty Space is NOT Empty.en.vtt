00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.680
One of the most amazing things about atoms

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.320
is that they're mainly empty space.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.160
If an atom were as wide as your arm span,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.280
then the electrons would all be whizzing about
inside the volume enclosed by your fingertips,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.180
meanwhile the nucleus would be sitting in the center,

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.140
and its diameter would be smaller
than the width of a single human hair...

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.900
So all of the atoms that make up you and me

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.260
and all the seemingly solid things in the universe

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
are mostly empty space.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.820
Now, this is incredible.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.420
But what is even more mind-boggling
is that empty space is not truly empty...

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.480
I know because I've seen it.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.260
This is a simulation by Prof. Derek Leinweber
at the University of Adelaide.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.100
It was made using a supercomputer to crunch the calculations of Quantum Chromo-Dynamics.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.860
Now that is the theory of
fundamental particles called 'quarks',

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.620
the building blocks of protons and neutrons,

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.980
and how they interact with each other through 'gluons'.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.760
What you're looking at here is the energy density
of the gluon field fluctuations.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.720
Where('s) the little red spots come out,
the energy density is very high...

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.520
and it fades down through the colors.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.120
So, in the lowest energy, the field fluctuations
are not rendering in this animation

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.920
so we can actually see into it.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.140
And what we see is a bubbling soup
of quantum field fluctuations,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.740
that come and go incredibly quickly.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.920
The frame rate of this simulation is one million billion billion frames per second.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.460
Now that is truly high speed...

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.200
The dimensions of this box are absolutely tiny.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.660
They are millionth of a billionth of a meter.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.780
roughly enough space to stick two protons.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.580
But there are no protons here...

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.880
This is a simulation of the vacuum on its own,

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.860
what we normally think of as 'empty space'.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.160
Empty space is actually full of this
quark-and-gluon field fluctuations.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:07.760
And, on average, it is possible to annihilate a quark
from empty space, 'cause it's not empty...!

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.460
That just sounds like the most ridiculous idea that ...

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.020
you're meant to have empty space,
 and yet you can go and get rid of stuff from it...

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.480
That's right. So it isn't empty !

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.440
Now it seems counterintuitive that the vacuum
at its lowest energy state should contain all of this stuff.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.340
But, in fact, to clear out the fluctuations

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.060
and create a truly empty vacuum
would require a lot of energy.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.740
The empty vacuum actually costs
an enormous amount of energy to create,

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.720
and if you were able to create it,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.620
you'd discover that that ... is actually unstable... that

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.900
any sort of perturbation would push that empty vacuum

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.720
into something where the vacuum is actually
full of quantum field fluctuations.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.060
Well, this may not be as strange as it first appears...

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.420
I mean, consider a permanent magnet.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.200
It has a magnetic field around it
at low energy, at room temperature.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.020
Not  because the individual little magnetic moments

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.240
of all the atoms inside are lined up.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.780
But if you were to heat it up,

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.480
you would give thermal energy to all those particles.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.100
And at a certain point, called the Curie Temperature,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.360
they would be so randomly aligned

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.960
that there would no longer be an overall magnetic field.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.760
So it actually takes energy to get rid
of the permanent magnetic field.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.600
Hmm, this is just like the quantum vacuum.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.360
And undertanding how the quantum
vacuum fluctuations work

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.900
gives us a sense of what the fundamental particles do,

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.980
like 'where are you most likely to find a quark?'

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.860
And it turns out that the quark
likes to sit on top of those lumps.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.300
Now those lumps come into and out of existence
fairly quickly and so ...

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.040
we like to think of the quarks as hopping
from one lump over to the next lump, as it appears,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.300
and then on to another one.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.420
I like to think of it as a hiker trying to
cross a stream that's running around...

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.380
Every now and then a stone pops up
because the water swirled around it.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.100
So you put your foot there...
You're looking for the next spot...

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.720
If you go quickly enough,
you might not get your feet wet...

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.680
Uh, so I think quarks are very much do... well we know quarks are very much doing the same thing.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.040
So while it is true that you and I and all of the other atoms in the universe are mostly empty space,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.260
it is also true that empty space isn't truly empty...

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.460
And in fact it is these vacuum fluctuations
which are essential for our existence.
