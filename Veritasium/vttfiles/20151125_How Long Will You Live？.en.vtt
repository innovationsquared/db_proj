00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.480
10,000 years ago, the average human life lasted just over 30 years, and then a hundred

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.940
years ago that number was up to 50, and if you were born in the last few decades

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.200
in the developed world then your life expectancy is 80 years. But that is

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.240
of course assuming that no major breakthroughs happen during your

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.880
lifetime that can slow the process of aging, and that may be a very bad

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.840
assumption. There's a new series on National Geographic Channel which was developed

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.880
with GE and the show's creators wanted to present my take on aging, so I'm here

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.760
at the GE Global Research Centre to talk to principal scientist Dr Fiona Ginty.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.280
—...and this would be kind of an example of, you know, one of the types of images

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.640
we would generate. So... —What are we looking at here? —So these are our cells that are

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.960
actively dividing, and these are cells are heading on their way to death

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.600
or apoptosis. —Aging is not recognized as the disease. I mean, there are plenty of

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.640
diseases we do acknowledge like diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's, and at their core

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.960
aging may be responsible for all of them. And yet aging seems natural because it's

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.560
something that we do from birth and for a while it makes us better. Bigger,

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.960
stronger, faster, more intelligent. But then at some point in your life

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.880
it reverses and aging makes our bodies decay and degrade. And why is that? Why do

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.140
we have to age? Why do our bodies have to decay? Well scientists are now

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.780
realizing there is a fundamental cellular mechanism at the heart of aging.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.880
Do we age at the macroscopic level because our cells are aging at the microscopic level?

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.480
—To a great extent, yes. There's only a finite number of times a cell will divide.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.000
—A key discovery was made by a biologist named Hayflick. He was studying normal

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.080
human cells and what he found was that they can only divide a finite number of times. On

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.640
average, it's about 50. Beyond that, the cell becomes senescent, which means it's an

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.120
aged cell. It can divide no longer. It lives for a little while but it's the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.440
accumulation of these senescent cells in our bodies that leads to aging on the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.080
macroscopic scale. So it's as though cells have this little timer inside them

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.800
that tells them when to stop dividing. But how do they know, and what is that timer?

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.640
—So telomeres are like how your shoelaces have, you know, a little bit of

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.480
plastic at the end to stop them from fraying. So telomeres are like the ends of

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.460
your shoelaces —But for chromosomes? —But for chromosomes. So

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.160
they keep the chromosome together and they stop it sticking to other chromosomes.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.200
So every time a cell divides, it loses some of the telomere. They estimate about

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.840
200 base pairs. —Why is that? Why can't it just copy to the end? —You know, it's just

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.400
sort of really the mechanics of it. You know, there's only so much space when

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.500
DNA polymerase does its job of replicating. —When it's copying? —Yeah.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.120
—So the telomere getting shorter is like your molecular clock. The cellular clock

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.680
inside each cell that tells it how many times it has divided.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.280
Would you want to have your telomeres measured? —Well, people do get their

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.520
telomeres measured. There have been associations made with lifestyle,

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.780
with exercise, showing that longer telomeres are associated with a more active

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.460
lifestyle, exercise. —What if there was a way to stop the telomeres from

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.880
shortening? If we could do that, maybe the cells would live forever.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.400
—There's another enzyme involved called telomerase, and it keeps rebuilding. Like,

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.920
it doesn't let the telomere ever shrink, so it... —It rebuilds the telomere? —Right, exactly.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.800
—There is one animal that doesn't seem to age, and that is the lobster. It just gets

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.780
bigger over time. It doesn't get weaker and its chromosomes don't change. It has

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.400
long telomeres that do not shorten, so it only dies when it gets eaten by

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.760
something else, like us. So how can we be more like a lobster? Some people would

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.720
say maybe I want my telomerase to be higher for longer. Would that help? I mean,

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.660
would that keep us younger? —I mean it's balance, because, you know, in cancer

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.560
you've got a perfect example of telomerase being active and it

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.200
becomes an unregulated growth situation. —This is the double-edged sword of

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:48.040
telomeres and telomerase. Cancer cells have really long telomeres, and they can

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.840
divide indefinitely, and that is the problem with cancer. Cancer is dividing

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:01.440
cells that won't stop and they won't die. So, in a way, cancer is the immortal cell

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.240
living within us. So maybe we've developed the aging process. Maybe we

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.720
have telomeres that shorten for a very good reason – because otherwise they could

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.360
become cancerous. —So one of the theories there is that the cells divide that

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:24.560
limited number of times because it stops them from accumulating damage that may be detrimental.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.780
So there is some... —It might cause them to become cancer. —Exactly. —Over the past hundred

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.500
years, developments in medicine have increased human lifespan more than we

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.300
could have imagined, and I can only expect that the next hundred years will bring

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.720
similarly incredible results. I'm not sure where or how they will take place,

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:50.640
but you can bet that your life expectancy today will not be the actual age at which you die.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.840
If you want to find out more about the future of aging, well then you

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.280
should definitely check out the episode of Breakthrough which was directed by

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:06.360
Ron Howard. That's airing on Sunday, November 29 at 9/8c. That is just

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.980
one of six episodes of Breakthrough which was developed by National Geographic

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.200
Channel and GE. So I want to thank them for supporting Veritasium, and I want

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.680
to thank you for watching.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.000
Oh, and I also made a video about the future of energy. It's over on the GE

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.040
YouTube channel, so go check it out!
