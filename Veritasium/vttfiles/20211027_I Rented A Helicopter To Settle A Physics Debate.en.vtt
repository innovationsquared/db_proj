00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.050
In 2014, the qualifying
exam for the US Physics Team

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.800
had this as question 19:

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.440
A helicopter is flying
horizontally at constant speed.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.990
A perfectly flexible
uniform cable is suspended

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.630
beneath the helicopter.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.950
Air friction on the
cable is not negligible.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.380
So, which of the following diagrams

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.310
best shows the shape of the cable

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.360
as the helicopter flies
through the air to the right?

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.721
Is it A. hanging straight down.

00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:29.480
B, hanging diagonally to the left?

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.800
C, this hook shape.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.300
D, the inverted hook shape,

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.640
or E, a kind of S bend.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.810
Now, apparently there's been a
certain amount of controversy

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.620
about the correct answer to this question.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.620
So, today we're gonna go
up in this helicopter,

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.683
and put this question to
rest once and for all.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.313
Let's go.

00:00:50.313 --> 00:00:54.530
(intense music)
(helicopter blades whirring)

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.900
A portion of this video was
sponsored by SimpliSafe,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.120
which allowed us to rent this helicopter.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.163
More about them at the end of the show.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.150
I've got several thousand
hours of carrying sling loads,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.990
fire buckets, concrete buckets,

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.130
doing power line construction,
actual power poles.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.020
You name it, anything
that needs to be moved

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.410
around the mountains, I've done.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.417
Biggest concern that I have is

00:01:14.417 --> 00:01:18.200
that the rope's gonna
interact with the rotor wash

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.570
as its interaction with the
ambient air around the aircraft.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.270
And we'll get a whipping
action that falls down the rope

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.970
and flips around on the end.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.070
To a point that we worry
if it will have a tendency

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.440
to work its way back up
towards the aircraft.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.820
Obviously, we don't want
it getting in the rotors

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.000
or the tail rotor.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.540
(helicopter blades whirring)

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.153
- [Derek] Alright, we're all set.

00:01:41.216 --> 00:01:42.049
Movin' up.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.690
(helicopter blades whirring)

00:01:50.096 --> 00:01:51.580
(intense music)

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.890
Here I'm deploying a battle rope,

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.660
like you'd see at the gym.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.952
This one is about 15 meters
long and it weighs 20 kilograms.

00:01:59.952 --> 00:02:01.494
- [Craig] See, the
whipping action's begun.

00:02:01.494 --> 00:02:03.077
- [Derek] I see it.

00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:06.220
So, if we go really
slow, will we avoid that?

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.290
- We'll see.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.900
We'll see where the rotor wash

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.687
stops interacting with the rope

00:02:10.687 --> 00:02:11.970
and the ambient wind.

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:15.400
Now the setup looks pretty simple,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.995
but few people agree on what
the right answer should be.

00:02:18.995 --> 00:02:20.290
(peaceful music)

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.623
When I polled YouTube, the
most common answer was C.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.850
Well done on making that
beautiful bell curve by the way.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.250
We got in touch with
the question's author,

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.880
professor Paul Stanley.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.580
There was some creative students
who actually constructed

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.200
their own homemade scenarios.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.200
One had a fan to the side and
another fan blowing downward

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.170
so that they could mimic
the motion of the helicopter

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.520
and suspended a string and
said, "Oh, it's this design."

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.507
And the faculty members
looked at it and said,

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:59.507
"Oh, obviously I can prove that
the answer is this answer."

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.840
They just didn't agree with each other.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.160
- If we approximated as
a chain of rigid links

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.512
- I don't think you can just do that.

00:03:06.512 --> 00:03:07.345
- What do you think?

00:03:07.345 --> 00:03:09.420
- I think you're more likely to be C.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.550
- I think it is D.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.383
- D.

00:03:13.383 --> 00:03:14.216
- My guess is B.

00:03:14.216 --> 00:03:15.049
- What do you think?
- B.

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:15.882
- B?

00:03:15.882 --> 00:03:16.715
- Imma go with A.

00:03:16.715 --> 00:03:19.123
- Interestingly, no one chose E.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.230
Have you locked in your prediction?

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.130
(helicopter blades whirring)

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.720
To make sure the rope doesn't come up

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.370
into the rotors of the helicopter,

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.940
pilot Craig wanted to keep
the rope on our right side

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.440
so he could keep an eye on it.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.650
Looks pretty good.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.853
- I'm trying to make it look good.

00:03:38.853 --> 00:03:40.892
I mean I'm really working on it.

00:03:40.892 --> 00:03:42.410
- You're working hard.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.910
So, we're not going straight forward.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.511
We're actually going diagonally
forward and to the left.

00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:53.683
(upbeat music)
(helicopter blades whirring)

00:03:53.683 --> 00:03:56.710
But you can clearly see the
rope is hanging straight,

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.313
diagonally to the left.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.990
That's a pretty good diagonal, man.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.543
So, the correct answer
to the question is B.

00:04:09.017 --> 00:04:09.979
You wanna pull it in?

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:11.146
- Up it comes.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.480
- [Derek] We're going to
try a few more experiments,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.750
adding a weight to the end of
the rope and then a parachute.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.770
But first I want to discuss
why the answer is B.

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.750
There are two external
forces acting on the rope,

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.680
gravity pulling it down and
air resistance to the left.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.720
When flying along at constant speed,

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.970
these forces must be perfectly balanced

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.060
by the tension in the rope.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.400
Now, when I set out to do this experiment,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.970
I wondered if the rope would be affected

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.960
by the air pushed down
by the helicopters rotor,

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.840
but judging by our results.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.350
This was not the case.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.470
- The rotor wash doesn't extend
down below the helicopter,

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.700
all that far. It
dissipates pretty quickly.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.030
- So, you can consider the
air resistance on the rope

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.100
as entirely due to its
motion through still air.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.810
Imagine dividing the rope
up into many short sections.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.090
Each section has the same weight

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.110
and experiences the same
amount of air resistance

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.980
because it has the same
cross-sectional area.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.230
And it's moving at the same speed.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.640
Now, the tension in
any section of the rope

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.320
must balance the sum of the air resistance

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.480
and weight of all the sections beneath it.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.720
So, the tension is zero
at the bottom of the rope,

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.160
and it increases linearly
up to a maximum at the top.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.600
You can see the tension is
small at the bottom of the rope,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.090
and that's why it wiggles around

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.360
while the top is much steadier.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.710
Now, although the magnitude
of tension changes

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.650
throughout the rope,
it's direction doesn't.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.380
And that's because the
ratio of air resistance

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.680
to weight is the same at
every point along the rope.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.870
That is why a uniform flexible cable hangs

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.540
in a straight diagonal line
when pulled at constant speed

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.060
by a helicopter.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.860
If the helicopter flies faster,

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.290
the angle of the rope changes,

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.660
but it still makes a
diagonal straight line

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.740
because the ratio of
air resistance to weight

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.243
is still constant along the
entire length of the rope.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.177
But this got me wondering,

00:06:12.177 --> 00:06:14.970
"What would happen if we added a weight

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.260
to the end of the rope?"

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.450
Here, I have a 20 pound,

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.470
that's an eight or nine kilos kettlebell.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.320
And I want to ask you
to make a prediction.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.320
What shape do you think
the rope will make now?

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.490
Will it still be that diagonal,

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.330
or will it be one of
the other five options?

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.400
One more question for you.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.250
If we chucked a weight at the bottom,

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.524
which shape would it be?

00:06:36.524 --> 00:06:37.650
- Oh.
- Probably D.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.350
- B, or possibly C.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.290
- [Derek] Does that change it?

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.823
- Then I think it would be B.

00:06:44.823 --> 00:06:47.656
(whimsical music)

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.983
- Easy to do on the ground.

00:06:51.822 --> 00:06:53.344
(helicopter blades whirring)

00:06:53.344 --> 00:06:56.400
Alright, we're dropping
the rope over the side.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.423
This one has 20 pound
kettlebell off the end of it.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.250
How's that feel when it's dangling?

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.465
- No lateral displacement at all.

00:07:07.465 --> 00:07:08.410
- Alright.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:09.920
- How's your forearms doing?

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.140
- I'm feeling good, you know.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.358
I feel like this is the
easy way, obviously.

00:07:14.358 --> 00:07:16.608
Gonna feel different
when I gotta pull it up.

00:07:17.477 --> 00:07:19.100
- Okay, is it down?
- Yup.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.180
Okay, let's give it a shot.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.170
(whimsical music)
(helicopter blades whirring)

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.570
Here the helicopter is flying

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.003
at nearly a hundred kilometers per hour,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.593
and the rope makes a different shape.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:36.480
You can clearly see,

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.200
it looks like an inverted J.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.590
This is option D.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.350
In fact, this is how the question

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.640
on the qualifying exam originated.

00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:48.790
- So, I taught for a
semester in Hong Kong,

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.610
and we'd go hiking in the new territories.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.440
One of the times I was hiking,

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.760
I saw a helicopter fly
with a cable beneath it.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.770
It was carrying something
to one of the remote parts

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:01.830
of the Hong Kong new territories.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.667
And I saw the shape of the
cable and thought to myself,

00:08:04.667 --> 00:08:07.820
"That looks a little counter
intuitive and very neat.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.720
This might make a good
multiple choice question

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.940
for the selection exam for the students."

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.290
The cable that I saw had a
weight hanging on the end,

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.780
which gave it a certain curved shape.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.740
When I shared this with the
other coaches, another coach,

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.757
Andrew Linn, looked at it and said,

00:08:25.757 --> 00:08:28.780
"I think the question
might even be more fun

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.180
if there is no weight on the cable

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.257
because that is even harder to imagine."

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.550
- [Derek] To understand why
the rope makes this shape,

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:40.440
we can use the same analysis as before.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.890
But now we need to add a large weight

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.330
to the end of the rope.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.810
And this means at the bottom,

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:48.230
the tension needs to be almost vertical

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.440
to support the weight of the kettlebell,

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.880
which has a lot of weight
but not much air resistance.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.830
As you go up the rope, the
ratio of total air resistance

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:01.750
to weight for everything
beneath increases.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.000
So, the rope turns more horizontal
in order for the tension

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.233
to balance out that
increasing air resistance.

00:09:11.163 --> 00:09:14.123
- You're more than halfway. You got it.

00:09:14.123 --> 00:09:15.110
(woman laughing)

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.040
- [Derek] For the final test,

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.810
I wanted to add something
to the bottom of the rope

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:21.830
that added almost no weight,
but significant air resistance.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.400
So, I picked a Veritasium flag, of course.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.080
So, what do you think about hanging this

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.260
at the end of the rope?

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.390
- Well, it's all science experiment for me

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.350
'cause these are all the
things you'd never do

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:33.650
with a helicopter in a row.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:34.720
- What would it be the real risks,

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.340
like tail rotor or this rotor, or both?

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:38.260
- Either.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.850
Any kind of this getting
into the inner tail rotor

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:43.383
would be destruction to the aircraft.

00:09:43.383 --> 00:09:48.383
(helicopter blades whirring)
(intense music)

00:10:02.364 --> 00:10:04.697
And we'll start, here we go.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.990
- [Derek] Now the rope still
seems to be pretty straight.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.680
I think it's because the flag

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.923
isn't actually adding much drag.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.350
Still looks pretty crazy, interestingly.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.120
So, we decided to add a small parachute

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.630
to the end of the rope.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:28.610
All right, let's try it.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.460
The concern here was that the parachute

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.210
could get flipped up into
the rotors during deployment.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.173
So, we bundled the shoot
up into a backpack.

00:10:38.038 --> 00:10:41.383
- [Craig] Very nicely done.

00:10:41.383 --> 00:10:43.078
- [Derek] Does it deploy more than that?

00:10:43.078 --> 00:10:44.878
- [Craig] No, but once we start moving,

00:10:44.878 --> 00:10:47.211
its gonna grab a lot of air.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.610
- [Derek] Now, with the
parachute at the end of the rope,

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.893
it makes a J shape, which is answer C.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.530
With extra air resistance
at the end of the rope,

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:00.730
but not much weight,

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:03.627
the tension has to be
virtually horizontal.

00:11:03.627 --> 00:11:05.820
And then as you go up the rope,

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.510
the ratio of total air
resistance to weight

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.760
for everything beneath decreases.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.890
So, the rope becomes more vertical

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.860
to balance out the increasing weight.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.670
So, depending on what's
on the end of the rope,

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.550
you could get answers B, C or D.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.000
Now, if you enjoyed this video,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.420
I bet you would also like my
bullet block experiment series.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.270
So, check it out.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:34.930
(retro beeping sound effect)

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:36.620
Now, hanging out the side of a helicopter

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.870
was not my safest moment,

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.060
but I do always feel safe here at home.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.420
Thanks to SimpliSafe, the
sponsor of this portion

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.253

that your home is
professionally monitored 24/7.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:01.430
You know, I started thinking
seriously about home security

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:04.000
when there was a police
helicopter circling overhead

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.780
one day, and it was
not dangling any ropes.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.820
It turned out the house across the street

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.090
had been broken into.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:12.880
Luckily, SimpliSafe makes it
easy to protect your home.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.120
They sent me a kit that took
only about an hour to set up.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.230
I currently use the
simply safe base station,

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.630
the cameras and sensors to keep tabs

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.760
on what's going on around my house.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:26.020
I also installed their new
wireless outdoor security camera,

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.670
which doesn't require an outlet.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.960
So, you can set it up literally anywhere.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.410
This camera has eight times
zoom, color night vision,

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:33.450
and two-way audio.

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:35.370
So, you can speak to
someone on your property.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.740
SimpliSafe's interactive
monitoring service

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.220
will call the police if
it's alerted to anything.
