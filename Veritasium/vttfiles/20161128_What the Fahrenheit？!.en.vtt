00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.400
As an Australian Canadian

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.640
the Fahrenheit temperature scale has
always seemed a bit arbitrary to me.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.600
I mean why does water
freezes at 32 degrees?

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.240
Why that integer and what exactly does 0 represent?

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.720
According to many sources

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.199
the Fahrenheit scale was
defined by setting 0 degrees

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.920
equal to the temperature of
the ice salt and water mixture

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.920
And a hundred degrees being
roughly equal to human body temperature.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.160
But that isn't true.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.960
The real story is much more
interesting and scientific.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.240
August 14th, 1701 was
almost certainly the worst day

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.080
in the life of 15 year-old
Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.480
On that day, both of his parents
died suddenly from mushroom poisoning.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.120
And he was sent from Poland
where he lived

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.800
to Amsterdam to become
an apprentice bookkeeper.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.800
But Fahrenheit couldn't
stand his apprenticeship and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.280
ran away so many times that his employer
put out a warrant for his arrest.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.799
Traveling from city to city around Europe,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.520
he became fascinated with
scientific instruments

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.320
and in particular, thermometers.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.895
In 1708, possibly seeking help
with the warrant,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.120
Fahrenheit met with
the mayor of Copenhagen,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.360
who happened to be
the famous astronomer Ole Rømer.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.560
Rømer is known for observing
the eclipses of Jupiter's moons

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.880
and realizing that variations
in the timing of those eclipses

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.640
was caused by the time
it took light to reach Earth.

00:01:17.665 --> 00:01:18.945
In other words, he found a way

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.156
to accurately measure
the finite speed of light.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.200
But, more pertinent to this story,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.840
in 1702, Rømer was housebound
after breaking his leg.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.200
And to pass the time, he devised a
brand-new temperature scale

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.799
with the freezing point of water
at 7.5 degrees

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.415
and body temperature at 22.5 degrees.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.239
Now, this might seem odd
until you consider that Rømer wanted

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.480
the boiling point of
water to be 60 degrees.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.575
As an astronomer, he had
experience dividing things by 60.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.880
So if you take this scale,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.360
divide it in half, in half again
and in half once more,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.119
you find the freezing point of water
one eighth up the scale,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.840
and human body temperature
three eighth up the scale.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.120
So at their meeting in 1708

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.400
Fahrenheit learned of Rømer's temperature
scale and adopted it as his own,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.360
adjusting it slightly because he found it

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.175
"inconvenient and inelegant on
account of fractional numbers".

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.400
So he scaled them up to 8 and 24.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.000
And this is the original Fahrenheit scale.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.480
He produced thermometers
for some time using this scale.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.615
But then at some later point,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.000
Fahrenheit multiplied all numbers
on the scale by 4

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.600
setting freezing point to the now-familiar
32 and body temperature to 96.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.360
It's unclear exactly why he did this.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.400
He may just have wanted
finer precision in his measurements.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.360
But I think there was a better reason.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.360
You see, Fahrenheit was an
excellent instrument maker.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.735
His thermometers agreed
with each other precisely

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.800
at a time when that was unheard of.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.720
He pioneered the use of mercury
as a measuring liquid,

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.615
which has the benefit of a much higher
boiling point than the alcohol

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.760
used in most other
thermometers at the time.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.000
And for these accomplishments

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.600
he was inducted into
the British Royal Society.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.880
And we know that he read
the works of Newton, Boyle, and Hook,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.640
in which he would have come across the idea

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.040
that one degree increase in
temperature could correspond to

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.920
a specific fractional increase in
the volume of the measuring liquid.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.800
And today, a one degree Fahrenheit
increase in temperature

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.840
increases the volume of
mercury by exactly one part in 10,000.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.640
Is this just a coincidence?

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.000
Well, we'll probably never know
for sure because

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.360
as an instrument maker Fahrenheit
was very secretive about his methods.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.240
But I think the data strongly
suggest that this was the case.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.160
So, what exactly did zero represent on
the scales of Fahrenheit, and Rømer?

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.560
By many accounts, it's the temperature of
salt ice and water mixture.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.440
The only problem is there are different
descriptions of these mixtures

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.840
And none of them actually produces
the temperature they're supposed to.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.760
More likely, I think they picked the
coldest temperature in winter

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.200
set that as zero

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.480
and later used ice and brine to
calibrate new thermometers.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.760
In his day, the Fahrenheit thermometer
was the best you could get.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.200
But now his scale is only
used regularly in the Cayman Islands,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.400
Bahamas, Belize— oh, and
the United States of America.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.320
So maybe it's time we all
adopted the global scale of temperature:

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.000
Celsius, which by the way,
wasn't invented by Celsius at all.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.680
Hey! So that was something
a little bit different.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.240
This video was animated by Marcello Ascani.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.560
I've got a link to his channel in
the description.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.360
You know, I became really fascinated
with temperature scale

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.000
after I saw the original
Celsius thermometer.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.280
You can see that video here.

Just go to audible.com/veritasium.

And I have a book that
I would recommend to you.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.800
It is called The Structure of Scientific Revolutions
by Thomas S. Kuhn.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.440
This is a classic in the history and
philosophy of science.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.640
And it'll make you see science
in a different way

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.880
because it shows us that
science is not just one process

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.600
but there are actually
revolutions that take place

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.295
when big discoveries are made.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.440
And that really changed
my thinking about science

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.360
when I first read this book
ten years ago.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.520
