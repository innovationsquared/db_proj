00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.199
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And I'm in London,

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:04.199
right outside Buckingham Palace.

00:00:04.199 --> 00:00:06.959
Oh, I'm actually running a little bit late
for tea with the Queen.

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:09.768
Yeah, she's really into tea,
but do you know what tea's mainly made out of?

00:00:09.768 --> 00:00:13.414
Water, and so today,
we're going to talk about water.

00:00:13.414 --> 00:00:16.200
Now, we all know that water
is vital

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.448
for life on Earth to exist
and that water covers

00:00:19.448 --> 00:00:22.536
more than 70%
of Earth's surface,

00:00:22.536 --> 00:00:24.881
but before we talk
about liquid water,

00:00:24.881 --> 00:00:27.458
I want to talk
about a culinary treat

00:00:27.458 --> 00:00:31.220
that occurs when you put a piece of bread
on the ground,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.469
and then, at the exact same time,
on the other side of the Earth,

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.161
the exact geographical opposite point,
you have someone else

00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:43.154
put another piece of bread—
Earth sandwich.

00:00:43.154 --> 00:00:46.239
That's right—it's a challenge
that was popularized

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.722
by Ze Frank, and it turns out
that making an Earth sandwich

00:00:49.722 --> 00:00:52.137
is incredibly difficult.
Why?

00:00:52.137 --> 00:00:54.273
Because of water.
That's right.

00:00:54.273 --> 00:00:56.711
If you take a globe
and you look at it

00:00:56.711 --> 00:00:58.711
so that France is right there
in the middle,

00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:01.935
you're only looking at one-half
of the Earth,

00:01:01.935 --> 00:01:04.443
but from that perspective,
you are looking

00:01:04.443 --> 00:01:08.994
at almost 90%
of Earth's dry land.

00:01:08.994 --> 00:01:10.994
It's all right there on that one side.

00:01:10.994 --> 00:01:13.800
It's known as the land hemisphere,
and the other side,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.772
the exact other half of the Earth,
is called the water hemisphere.

00:01:16.772 --> 00:01:19.791
Now, you might be saying to yourself,
"Okay, great.

00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:21.904
"So Earth sandwiches
are almost always soggy.

00:01:21.904 --> 00:01:24.133
Why should I care?"
I don't know.

00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:26.153
But here's something
that you should care about—

00:01:26.153 --> 00:01:29.195
the Three Gorges Dam
in China,

00:01:29.195 --> 00:01:32.190
one of the largest hydroelectric dams
ever constructed.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.324
Completed in 2006,
and upon completion,

00:01:35.324 --> 00:01:38.691
it fundamentally changed
something about Earth.

00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:41.867
You know how a figure skater
spinning in place

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:44.836
can slow down their speed
by moving their arms out,

00:01:44.836 --> 00:01:48.273
by moving some of their body mass
away from the middle of their body?

00:01:48.273 --> 00:01:51.036
Well, the same thing can happen to Earth.

00:01:51.036 --> 00:01:54.449
The Three Gorges Dam
did exactly what a figure skater does

00:01:54.449 --> 00:01:56.934
when they move their arms
away from their center.

00:01:56.934 --> 00:02:01.763
It transferred 39 trillion kilograms of water

00:02:01.763 --> 00:02:05.710
175 meters above sea level.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.955
NASA calculated that
that massive amount of water moved

00:02:09.955 --> 00:02:12.834
caused Earth's rotation to slow down,

00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:16.363
so that every day of your life
since that dam was finished

00:02:16.363 --> 00:02:21.471
has been longer
by .06 microseconds.

00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:23.651
It's not something that,
for all intents and purposes,

00:02:23.651 --> 00:02:25.071
you have to worry about.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.875
If you are worried,
you might be hydrophobic,

00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:32.242
but you're in good company—
there are a lot of good hydrophobic materials,

00:02:32.242 --> 00:02:34.889
and they behave
in some pretty cool ways.

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:38.836
Hydrophobic materials are resistant
to getting wet.

00:02:38.836 --> 00:02:41.483
That's right—they're usually made
out of hydrocarbons

00:02:41.483 --> 00:02:44.780
that don't form good hydrogen bonds
with water molecules,

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.357
and because it takes more energy
for the water

00:02:47.357 --> 00:02:50.794
to spread out on those surfaces,
the water just sticks together.

00:02:50.794 --> 00:02:53.696
It coheres to itself
and forms nice little spheres.

00:02:53.696 --> 00:02:57.551
Now, in certain cases,
super-hydrophobia occurs

00:02:57.551 --> 00:02:59.551
and it looks awesome.

00:02:59.551 --> 00:03:03.049
The leaves of the lotus plant do this
and when water falls on them,

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.714
the water just floats around
like some big old blob

00:03:05.714 --> 00:03:07.714
of liquid mercury or something.

00:03:07.714 --> 00:03:10.915
It's a very bizarre trick,
and I have you guys to thank

00:03:10.915 --> 00:03:12.535
for bringing it to my attention.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.480
In fact, it was that message
that inspired me to do an episode

00:03:15.486 --> 00:03:18.017
about water in the first place,
so thanks.

00:03:18.017 --> 00:03:22.382
One final note on hydrophobia—
it can happen in humans.

00:03:22.382 --> 00:03:24.584
And I don't mean being afraid of swimming

00:03:24.584 --> 00:03:29.018
or not liking the ocean—
I mean an actual psychological aversion

00:03:29.018 --> 00:03:30.718
to the sight of water.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.380
Rabies is a virus that,
if left untreated,

00:03:33.384 --> 00:03:35.798
can lead
to severe neurological damage.

00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:40.117
In the late stages of rabies,
the victim salivates constantly,

00:03:40.117 --> 00:03:43.136
but their throat and jaw
become paralyzed,

00:03:43.136 --> 00:03:46.846
which means that the body cannot control
the fluid in its own mouth

00:03:46.846 --> 00:03:49.377
and is in a constant fear
of drowning.

00:03:49.377 --> 00:03:53.487
This man has contracted rabies
and is in the late stages of the disease.

00:03:53.487 --> 00:03:55.827
As he attempts to take a drink of fluid,

00:03:55.827 --> 00:03:59.540
his body recoils instinctively,
as if the water might burn him.

00:03:59.544 --> 00:04:03.050
But thanks to vaccination efforts,
the threat of rabies

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.370
all over the world
has been significantly reduced.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.550
Now, we could say a lot of other stuff
about water,

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.530
but I might save that
for another episode.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.370
In the meantime...

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.370
And as always,

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.800
thanks for watching.
