00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:03.460
Twenty-one grams.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:10.200
That is the mass of all of the electrons in
your body if, like me, you weigh about 70

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.200
kilograms.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.129
Now all of the mass comes from the Higgs mechanism,
which means that as your electrons are traveling

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.750
through space time, they interact with the
Higgs field and it is that that gives them

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.800
their mass.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.920
It slows them down and stops them from traveling
at the speed of light.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.580
But most of your mass doesn’t come from
the Higgs mechanism.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.390
And neither does all of this stuff that you
see around you.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.500
The mass is coming from somewhere quite different
and that is because most of your mass and

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.640
most of this mass comes from neutrons and
protons and they are not fundamental particles.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.739
They are made of constituent particles called
quarks.

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.840
Now the theory that describes quarks and their
interactions with each other through gluons

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.320
is called quantum chromo dynamics.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.890
And chromo is the Greek word for color.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.950
So in some way these objects are meant to
carry the color charge.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.140
But they are much, much smaller than the wavelength
of visible light, so there is no way that

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.530
they are actually colored, but it is a useful
analogy that helps us think about how they

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.220
interact and the particles that they can make
up.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.680
Now the rules are pretty simple.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.810
In order for a particle to exist, it must
be colorless or white, like this house.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.479
Now you can accomplish that in two different
ways.

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.250
You could make three quarks in where each
one is a different color, red, green and blue,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.820
so overall they combine to produce white.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.380
Or you could use a quark and an anti quark
where one is a color like green and the other

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.759
is its anti color, say, magenta.

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.860
Now what I would like to do on this little
patch of beach behind me is simulate how quarks

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.100
actually bind together and form different
particles.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.899
Now for this you need to remember that in
the last video we talked about how empty space

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.700
is not truly empty.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.180
So the beach here is has these undulations
in it which represent the fluctuations in

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.180
the gluon field.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.530
But you have to imagine this beach sort of
rippling and these bumps coming and going.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.680
Now that is really important, because to get
rid of those fluctuations actually takes energy.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.710
And this is an important part of binding the
quarks together.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.690
The existence of quarks actually suppresses
the gluon fluctuations and creates what is

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.750
called a flux tube, an area where there is
really nothing in the vacuum and that is in

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.521
between this quark and the anti quark.

00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:22.010
And that pairs them up and creates what is
called a meson, the quark, anti quark pair.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.580
What is interesting about that flux tube is
that as these quarks become more separated,

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.330
the flux tube remains the same diameter and
the same sort of depth of suppression of the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.740
field, which means that the force doesn't
actually increase.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.750
It is not like a spring.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.410
It is not like an elastic band.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.550
The force is the same that is pulling these
quarks back together.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.610
But you are putting more work in as you move
these quarks and anti quarks further apart.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.060
And so for a time people thought: Well, these
quarks are always going t be confined, however

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.060
far you move them.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.190
You are just going to get a really long flux
tube.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.730
But what actually happens is you that you
put in enough energy that you can actually

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.370
create a quark, anti quark pair.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.190
&gt;&gt; Nevertheless, the quarks are still combined.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.810
You can never see an individual quark, because
if you try to pull it out, you put so much

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.110
energy into the situation that another quark,
anti quark pair will be created.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.780
&gt;&gt; Now to form a proton, we are going to need
an up quark, another up quark and a down quark.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.020
Now the standard model of a proton that you
have probably seen involves these quarks bounded

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.150
together by little gluon springs that go between
them.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.910
&gt;&gt; We know that that picture is totally wrong
now.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.060
Even in the best sense you might have hoped
that you would see flux tubes around the edge

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.060
of the triangle.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.060
But we know that, in fact, they don’t do
that.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.069
That you get these y shaped flex tubes.

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.420
&gt;&gt; The crazy thing about a proton is that
there may be more than three quarks there.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.260
You see, you can have additional quark, anti
quark pairs pop in and out of existence.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.030
So at any given time there could be five or
seven or nine, any odd number of quarks could

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.180
make up a proton.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.420
So this is what a proton actually looks like.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.230
You can see that the quarks like to sit on
those lumps in the gluon field.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.490
And you can see the two up quarks and a down
quark, but there is also a strange quark and

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.450
an anti strange quark, which is strange, because
you don’t normally think of these quarks

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.400
being inside a proton, but they can be at
any particular point in time.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.850
And you can also see that these quarks have
cleared out the vacuum.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.060
And you can see that there is kind of these
flux tubes which are the areas where the gluon

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.980
field has been suppressed.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.080
And that is really what is binding these quarks
together.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.759
&gt;&gt; That is the strong force that binds quarks
into the heart of the proton.

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:40.800
&gt;&gt; It is intrinsically related to the fact
that clearing out those fluctuations has more

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.340
energy than where they are.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.750
&gt;&gt; That is right.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.290
It costs energy to clear the vacuum.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.820
&gt;&gt; So where is the mass of the proton really
coming from?

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.320
Well, of course, the constituent quarks do
interact with the Higgs field and that gives

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.440
them a small amount of mass.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.940
But if you add up the mass of all the quarks
in the proton it would only account for about

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.370
one percent of its total mass.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.650
So where is the rest of the mass coming from?

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.730
The answer is: energy.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.620
You know, Einstein’s famous equation: E
equals mc squared.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.690
Well, that says we have got a lot of energy
for just a little bit of a mass.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.600
But if you rearrange the equation you can
see that we can get an amount of mass if there

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.780
is lots of energy there.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.750
And that is really where most of the mass
of the proton is coming from.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.940
It is from the fact that there are these energy
fluctuations in the gluon field and the quarks

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.980
are interacting with those gluons.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.230
That is where your mass is coming from.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.680
It is coming from the energy that is in there.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.800
You know, Einstein talked about, well, if
I had a hot cup of tea, it would actually

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.610
have a slightly greater mass than the same
cup of tea when cold.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.610
And he was right.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.830
I mean, you can’t measure it with a cup
of tea, but most of your mass you owe to E

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.000
equals mc squared, you owe to the fact that
your mass is packed with energy, because of

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.060
the interactions between the quarks and these
gluon fluctuations in that gluon field.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.330
I think it is extraordinary, because what
we think of as ordinarily empty space, you

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.850
know, that turns out to be the thing that
gives us all most of our mass.
