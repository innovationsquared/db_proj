00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.029
Most processes in our universe are time reversible in other words the physics works the same way forwards or backwards

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.950
Which is why you can't tell if I'm playing these videos normally or in reverse

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.129
People typically point to entropy as the only exception to this rule. The second law of thermodynamics

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.100
states that the entropy of a system or the amount of disorder always increases with time *buzzer sound*

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.670
But increasing entropy is an emergent property, the result of the motions of many many particles

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.750
Which raises the question:

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.000
Can fundamental particles themselves tell the direction of time?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.040
Or, in other words, is there a physical process on the scale of individual particles that looks different

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.409
forwards vs backwards? The answer surprisingly is yes.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.220
In particle physics there are three major symmetries that were always expected to hold: charge, parity, and time.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.180
Time symmetry, as we've already discussed, means interactions work the same way forwards or backwards in time

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.129
Charge symmetry means interactions are unaffected if all the charges are swapped in other words

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.200
there is nothing special about what we call positive charge. Nature treats it exactly equal and opposite to negative charge

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.620
and parity symmetry means the laws of physics are indifferent to left- or right-handedness.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Now to understand what that means imagine a giant mirror were held up to our universe

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:29.560
and in the mirror the z direction Is reversed and my right hand becomes my left hand

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.760
but the laws of physics shouldn't care I mean

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.440
they should work exactly the same way in the mirror world as they do in the regular one

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.080
with no preference for left- or right-handedness or to put it another way

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.580
there should be no experiment that you could do that would tell you whether or not you are in the mirror world

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.260
Each of these symmetries is known by its initials- C, P, and T

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.900
in the 1950s it was thought that all fundamental particles obey these symmetries

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.000
But then in 1956 a paper written by Li and Yang pointed out that parity symmetry

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.780
had actually never been tested in experiments involving the weak force

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.260
So at Christmas break that year physics professor Chien Shang Wu of Columbia University had planned

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.180
to go on vacation with her husband who is also a physicist

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.560
but instead, so intrigued by the possibility that the weak force might violate parity, she decided to stay behind

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:23.999
And be the first person to test it. To do this she and a team of

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.409
Low-temperature scientists cooled a collection of cobalt-60 atoms to just three thousandths of a degree above absolute zero

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.589
Then they applied a strong magnetic field to align all the nuclei with their spin pointing in the same direction

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.289
Now cobalt 60 is radioactive and it decays via the weak nuclear force releasing a beta particle

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:49.438
Which is just an electron and what the experiment measured was the direction in which these electrons were emitted

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.809
Relative to the spin of the cobalt 60 nuclei. To see how this would work under parity symmetry

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:01.408
Let's consider the mirror image version of this experiment in the mirror the direction of the z axis is flipped

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.949
But the direction of nuclear spin is not that's because an object

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.060
That's rotating clockwise is still rotating clockwise in the mirror

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.319
So this means that the spins of the regular and mirror nuclei are aligned the mirror experiment is actually the same

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.929
Experiment as the original now when a cobalt 60 nucleus decays and emits an electron that electron

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.060
Could go say to the left or to the right

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.399
Now if parity symmetry is respected the electrons should be equally likely to go in any direction

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:36.418
That way both the normal and mirror image experiments would give the same results however if the electrons were emitted in one direction

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.059
preferentially say in the positive z direction

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.930
well

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.019
Then in the mirror experiment the electrons would also have to fly off

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.268
preferentially in the mirror positive Z direction which is opposite to the original positive z direction

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:54.508
So in the normal experiment the electrons would be emitted say opposite the direction of nuclear spin, but in the mirror version

00:03:54.509 --> 00:04:00.989
They'd be emitted in the same direction as nuclear spin, so how does this make any sense it would allow you to determine?

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.979
Whether you're in the mirror world or not

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:07.649
It's like the spinning top from Inception if the electrons from the cobalt 60 nuclei

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.379
Go one way, you're in mirror world and if they go the other way

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:17.158
You know you're in normal world now crazy as this may seem. This is exactly what professor Wu saw

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.499
Electrons were emitted preferentially in one direction and not just by a little bit

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.380
They were predominantly emitted opposite nuclear spin, so not only does the weak force violate parity

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.339
It comes close to violating parity as much as is physically possible

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.989
This destroyed a basic assumption of theoretical physics that had been around for decades

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.949
Somehow the universe cares about left or right-handed nests when wu announced her results

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.310
They shocked the physics world after being told of the experiment famous physicist and Nobel laureate

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:58.019
Wolfgang Pauli said "That's total nonsense," and insisted the result was mistaken when the experiment was independently replicated

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:06.210
Theoretical physicists had to accept that the universe we live in is not the one they had imagined the Nobel Prize was actually awarded for

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.639
The discovery of parity violation in 1957 the very same year these results were published

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.899
This required a profound shift in thinking for physicists, but before throwing everything out and starting again from scratch

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.900
They formulated a workaround

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:25.709
Maybe it was okay that the weak force broke parity because it's not a real

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:31.919
symmetry of the universe itself just part of a larger symmetry charge parity or CP symmetry

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.999
The idea was if the mirror flipped not only these axes

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.259
But it also swapped the particles for anti particles with their charges reversed

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.770
well

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:48.509
Then the symmetry would be restored and the mathematics behind our laws of physics would still work now this gave physicists some comfort until in

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.659
1964 it was found that some particles can also violate the combined charge parity symmetry and

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:02.940
Boom you got yourself another Nobel Prize now two rules which physicists once thought were fundamental laws of nature were broken so

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:10.469
They retreated behind their last set of theoretical defenses the combined symmetry of CP T where T is time

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.949
Sure, they said the weak force violates parity and charge

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:21.989
Parity, but certainly not charge parity and time together and to this day physicists are still pretty sure that CP T is a real

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:29.219
Symmetry of the universe so far no experiment has found a violation of CPT in fact if CP T is

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:35.010
Violated we would have to rewrite a lot of the last century's work because it would mean that special relativity and quantum

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:37.829
Field theory are both wrong ok

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.449
So let's say that CP T

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:44.669
Is a true symmetry think about the implications of this if we know that CP can be violated?

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:48.718
But CP t cannot, then time symmetry must also be broken

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.709
otherwise there would be no way for the combined three-way symmetry to be maintained while two of the sub symmetries are broken and

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.180
Physicists have actually conducted

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.549
Experiments that confirm that certain particles directly break time symmetry

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:09.029
For example when a pair of quarks are held together by the strong force there are sometimes two different possible

00:07:09.249 --> 00:07:14.099
Arrangements and they can switch back and forth between these two arrangements via the weak force

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:17.008
But switching in one direction takes longer than switching back

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:20.399
So if you could make a recording of this event it would look different

00:07:20.499 --> 00:07:27.269
If you played the recording forwards than if you played it backwards and that's exactly what it means to break time symmetry in

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:33.869
Certain cases then fundamental particles can tell the difference between going forwards and backwards in time

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:40.109
The second law of thermodynamics is not the only physical process that prefers one direction in time

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:47.879
Now is this the origin of our perception that time only goes one way, or is it the reason for the universe's arrow of time?

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.769
The truth is that we still have no idea why time only goes in one direction

00:07:53.289 --> 00:08:00.179
What's interesting is that physicists once thought that parity charge and time were these symmetries that were unbreakable?

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:04.049
But over time each of these symmetries was demonstrably violated

00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:11.938
So is the ultimate symmetry CPT also unbreakable or will it fall taking quantum field theory and special relativity with it?

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:18.509
These are just some of the big basic unresolved mysteries left in our quest to understand the universe

00:08:18.969 --> 00:08:23.369
Perhaps one day another physicist will give up their vacation to figure out the answer

00:08:26.919 --> 00:08:30.898
This episode of veritasium was animated and co-written by my friend jorge

00:08:30.899 --> 00:08:36.629
Cham who is also the creator of PhD comics and now he's written a book. Yeah. It's called we have no idea

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:37.199
It's a book

00:08:37.199 --> 00:08:42.719
I wrote with physicist Daniel Weitz in' and it's about all the things we don't know about the universe although the big things like

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:44.310
dark matter and dark energy

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:49.380
But also all the little things like what are all those fundamental particles for and it has cartoons in it

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:54.789
Yep, and lots of bad puns, so that's like. It's up your alley. You should check it out

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:58.990
I'll put a link to it in the description and Olive core has other projects. Thanks
