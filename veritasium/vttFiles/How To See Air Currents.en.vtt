00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.740
If there were a portal through which you could see all of the invisible

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.020
air currents, temperature gradients and differences in pressure and

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.320
composition of air,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.660
then this is what it would look like to strike a match.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.660
This is helium being squeezed out of a balloon.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.809
You could see the warm air rising off your hands.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.130
The invisible vapors of isopropyl alcohol and a plume of ejected material when you sneeze.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.419
This is the setup for how I made those shots over here

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.180
I have a 40 centimeter diameter concave parabolic mirror normally this would be used to make a telescope

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.440
but if it form, just a tiny piece of a big

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:45.789
spherical shell

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.140
Right? A giant spherical mirror that we're inside

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.940
then the center of that mirror would be right here

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.860
And that's where I've placed this led it's three millimeter

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.119
But I try to make the light source even smaller by painting it with some black nail polish

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.139
so, we try to approximate a point source of light there now that light

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:10.319
spreads out in all directions, and it bounces off the mirror and reflects back

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.860
Almost to exactly the point where the light is

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.020
you can see that the light converges to a point right there

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.120
Now I've offset the light just a little bit so that this light

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.560
will pass straight through and into the lens of my camera

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.700
So right here, I position this razor blade,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.940
so it cuts off about half the light passing through

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.240
This setup allows you to see tiny variations in what is in front of the mirror

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.360
For example when you have hot gases coming off of a candle

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.260
Well, you can see that because as the reflected light from the led

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.820
Passes through this column of hot air, it

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.620
changes directions ever so slightly that is it refracts

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.620
and the reason for that is because the

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.220
Refractive index of hot air is different from the refractive index of the cooler air

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.079
Around it now refractive index is a measure of how fast light travels through a medium

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.689
Relative to its speed in a vacuum

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.839
So for air the value is pretty close to 1 but hotter air actually has a lower index of refraction

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.060
in this case the difference in refractive index is incredibly tiny

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.060
and so we don't notice the deflection of the light

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.379
but with this setup

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.209
It actually makes a difference because some of the light that would have passed over this razor blade

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.950
Instead gets deflected down and gets blocked and that forms a darker spot on the image

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.840
Similarly some light that would have hit the razor blade is instead deflected over

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.080
it creating a brighter spot on the image and that

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.900
is how this works, so you can see the heat rising off your head and

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.959
You can see your breath

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.810
And you can see the cold air poured out of [a] cup of ice

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.680
But temperature is not the only thing that affects the refractive index

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.569
different materials [different] substances

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.240
They have different refractive indices for example the butane in a lighter obviously we can't see that

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.629
It's coming out right now, but the camera can even before the lighter is lit

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.620
light also refracts when it passes through a bubble

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.740
and the amount depends on the thickness of that bubble film

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.760
This technique is known as Schlieren based on the German word [flir]

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.760
which means streak and it was first observed in

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.140
1665 by Robert Hooke who was using

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.840
Two candles and some lenses then in the 19th century

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.200
they used this method to try to find defects and the glass used to make

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.480
Lenses and more recently people have used Schlieren to study

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.049
Aerodynamics and fluid flow because it allows you to see those pressure differences in temperature gradients

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.410
So [you] can look at [shockwaves] and differences in the composition of gases

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.630
So when you watch the lighting of this match you're seeing heat generated from Friction

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.060
Igniting phosphorus which in turn generates more heat and begins the reaction between sulfur and potassium

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.410
Chlorate which releases sulfur dioxide which you can also see

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.159
And you can see my breath as I blow [out] the flame [I]

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.570
Am so excited that I got this set up to work

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.739
So if you can think [of] anything that would look really cool in Schlieren, then let me know in the comments

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.880
And I will try [to] make [it] happen, and if you're new to this channel, [we'll] click here to subscribe

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.189
I've got some awesome videos coming up very soon
