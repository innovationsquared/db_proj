00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.880
- This video was sponsored by KiwiCo.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.033
More about them at the end of the show.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.264
On February 15th, 2013,
over Chelyabinsk Russia,

00:00:19.264 --> 00:00:22.010
an asteroid heavier than the Eiffel tower

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.071
slammed into the atmosphere.

00:00:24.071 --> 00:00:28.920
And then 30 kilometers above
the ground, it exploded.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.320
This violent event was
brighter than the sun,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.062
but so high up that it was silent,

00:00:35.062 --> 00:00:38.615
for a full 90 seconds after the blast,

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:41.890
which only made the devastation worse.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.307
- So you see all these videos, of people,

00:00:44.307 --> 00:00:45.530
"Look, oh, what was that?"

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.567
They see the smoke trail in the sky,

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:49.030
"Oh, that's amazing!"

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.478
And then, you know,

00:00:50.478 --> 00:00:52.360
just when you think
nothing's gonna happen,

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.820
the shockwave hits and
it blows out the windows,

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.850
thousand people got glass
in their face and their eyes

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.940
because they're looking
through the windows.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.030
- The shockwave damaged
thousands of buildings

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.463
and injured 1500 people.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.953
What makes the Chelyabinsk
incident kind of embarrassing

00:01:10.953 --> 00:01:12.811
is that the very same day,

00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:16.150
scientists had predicted
that an asteroid would make

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.900
a close fly-by of earth.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.971
And they were right.

00:01:19.971 --> 00:01:23.349
16 hours after Chelyabinsk,
a similar sized asteroid,

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:24.766
known as Duende,

00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:28.840
came within 27,000 kilometers
of earth's surface.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.611
That's closer than satellites
in geosynchronous orbit.

00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:36.280
But while they correctly
predicted this close approach,

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.290
they completely missed
the unrelated asteroid

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.053
that exploded over Russia.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.326
And the truth is, this
happens all the time.

00:01:44.326 --> 00:01:47.530
We're really not that good
at detecting asteroids

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.090
before they hit us.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.760
Since 1988, over 1200
asteroids bigger than a meter

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.770
have collided with the
earth, and of those,

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.270
we detected only five before they hit,

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.157
never with more than a day of warning.

00:02:03.157 --> 00:02:06.140
With all our technology
and all the telescopes

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.751
across the earth, not to
mention the ones in space,

00:02:08.751 --> 00:02:12.380
why do we struggle to
detect dangerous asteroids

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.733
before they strike?

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:16.950
What are the chances that
a big asteroid will hit,

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.508
wiping out most, if not all life on earth?

00:02:20.508 --> 00:02:25.508
And if we saw one coming,
what could we do about it?

00:02:25.653 --> 00:02:27.986
(explosion)

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.970
Asteroids are the leftover debris

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.963
from when our solar system formed.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.771
Four and a half billion years ago,

00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:48.771
rocks and dust clumped together
into molten protoplanets.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.474
Inside, heavy elements,

00:02:51.474 --> 00:02:56.474
metals like iron, nickel, and
iridium, sank into the core,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.915
leaving lighter silicate
minerals on the surface.

00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:01.642
Some of these protoplanets

00:03:01.642 --> 00:03:05.091
grew into the planets we know today.

00:03:05.091 --> 00:03:08.066
But many more collided with each other,

00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:10.423
breaking into pieces.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.840
These pieces continued orbiting the sun,

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.400
and smashing into each
other and breaking into

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.560
even smaller fragments.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.540
These became the asteroids,

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.558
which is why some of them are rocky,

00:03:29.558 --> 00:03:33.150
loose conglomerates of gravel sized rocks

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.713
called rubble piles,

00:03:34.713 --> 00:03:38.068
and others, from the
cores of planetesimals,

00:03:38.068 --> 00:03:39.823
are mostly metal.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.830
- So this is, this is an iron meteorite.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.324
And essentially it's the piece of a core

00:03:47.324 --> 00:03:49.650
of a small planetary body,

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.850
like basically a small planet,

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.037
that formed four and a
half billion years ago,

00:03:55.037 --> 00:03:58.345
differentiated, so the
core material fell out,

00:03:58.345 --> 00:04:01.098
and then this thing was smashed apart by

00:04:01.098 --> 00:04:03.060
a collision with another asteroid.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.876
That's the oldest thing you'll ever see.

00:04:06.876 --> 00:04:10.150
- Most of the asteroids have stable orbits

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.997
between Mars and Jupiter,
in the main asteroid belt.

00:04:13.997 --> 00:04:18.063
But some have made their
way closer to earth.

00:04:18.063 --> 00:04:21.382
And these are known as near earth objects.

00:04:21.382 --> 00:04:24.300
They are of greatest interest to us

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.480
because of the threat they pose.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.090
In his last book,

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.090
Stephen Hawking considered
an asteroid impact

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.496
to be the greatest
threat to life on earth.

00:04:34.496 --> 00:04:39.036
But finding asteroids is
difficult for several reasons.

00:04:39.036 --> 00:04:42.280
Most are spotted by
ground-based telescopes.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.630
- [Prof. Jewitt] So
what you do is you take

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.530
a sequence of pictures,

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.460
one, two, three, one, two, three, four,

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.230
and you look for essentially a moving dot.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.160
And it's moving because it's
orbiting around the sun.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.049
Whereas the stuff far away, the
stars and galaxies, are not.

00:04:56.049 --> 00:04:58.450
- But you have to look carefully.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.810
Asteroids are not very big.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.498
They range from meters
up to kilometers in size.

00:05:04.498 --> 00:05:06.750
And in the vast expanse of space,

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.282
rocks like that just don't stand out.

00:05:09.282 --> 00:05:12.240
And even the small ones can be damaging.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.400
The Chelyabinsk meteor was only around

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.260
20 meters in diameter,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.683
roughly the width of two school buses.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.311
Plus, asteroids are rough and dark.

00:05:22.311 --> 00:05:26.661
They only reflect around 15%
of the light that hits them.

00:05:26.661 --> 00:05:29.160
So our best chance to see them

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.230
is when they're fully
illuminated by the sun.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.190
And that's why over 85%

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.760
of the near earth asteroids we've detected

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.207
were found in the 45 degrees of sky

00:05:39.207 --> 00:05:41.896
directly opposite the sun.

00:05:41.896 --> 00:05:44.300
This is called the opposition effect,

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.430
and it means there are
likely more near earth

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.438
and potentially hazardous asteroids

00:05:49.438 --> 00:05:51.771
that haven't been detected yet.

00:05:51.771 --> 00:05:55.320
Any asteroid approaching
from the direction of the sun

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.140
just can't be seen.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.023
This is exactly what
happened with Chelyabinsk.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
So far, we have detected and
cataloged a million asteroids,

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.340
the vast majority of which
are in the main asteroid belt.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.001
But 24,000 are near earth objects.

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:19.519
Ones that we need to keep a
particularly close eye on.

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:22.720
Because even once you've
detected an asteroid,

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.490
it's hard to tell if
it will hit the earth.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.370
- So if you just discover an object,

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.470
and you only have data from a few days,

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.480
then you can't really
tell where it's gonna go,

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.340
because you're tryna take
this little arc of motion

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.480
and predict it far into the future, so,

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.300
what you need is observations
over years and years.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.606
But even if you have perfect
observations of an asteroid,

00:06:42.606 --> 00:06:45.040
there's kind of a fundamental limit

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.262
to how far in the future you can predict.

00:06:47.262 --> 00:06:49.780
And that's because of a couple of effects,

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.010
but one is that, you know,

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.650
they're not just orbiting the
sun with no other influence.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.490
All of the planets have gravity,

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.544
and all of the planets are pulling on

00:06:58.544 --> 00:07:02.940
near earth asteroids and can
change the orbit significantly.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.850
So there is something
called dynamical chaos,

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.590
which basically means, after
a certain amount of time,

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.836
you don't know where the
asteroid is gonna be.

00:07:10.836 --> 00:07:12.810
And in practice, what that means is,

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.350
we can't do any work more
than 100 years in the future.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.817
So the maximum time you can
predict with any accuracy at all

00:07:20.817 --> 00:07:23.673
where a body will be is about 100 years.

00:07:23.673 --> 00:07:26.250
- And this is pretty important,

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.043
because we know with certainty,

00:07:28.043 --> 00:07:31.896
if one does hit, the
results will be dramatic.

00:07:31.896 --> 00:07:33.950
(gentle music)

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.940
This is Barringer crater in Arizona.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.210
It's named after a mining
engineer, Daniel Barringer,

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.610
who was the first to suggest

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.640
it was formed by a meteorite impact.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.149
The prevailing view,
even up until the 1950s,

00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:50.271
was that it was created
by volcanic activity.

00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:53.830
But Barringer was
convinced it was the site

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.065
of an iron meteorite impact.

00:07:56.065 --> 00:07:59.860
So in 1903, he staked a mining claim,

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.919
and began drilling for
the metallic meteorite,

00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:05.750
which he believed to be worth more than

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.620
a billion 1903 dollars.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.453
- Yeah.

00:08:09.453 --> 00:08:10.670
So people are motivated by money, right?

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:11.503
So they thought,

00:08:11.503 --> 00:08:13.330
"Hey, we can get some
iron for free!" basically.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.360
So they started to drill
in the bottom of the crater

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.462
and found nothing.

00:08:17.462 --> 00:08:20.690
And then they started to do
other exploratory drills.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:23.310
And this went on for years and decades.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.580
They started to drill sideways.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.413
Somebody said, you know,

00:08:25.413 --> 00:08:27.860
maybe it came in from
an angle, which it did.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.370
And maybe the iron is not under the middle

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.340
but maybe it's over there under the wall.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.630
So he was doing drilling,

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.593
if you go there, you
can see the drills now.

00:08:35.593 --> 00:08:37.917
He was drilling around the
wall, he found nothing.

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:39.600
So what they didn't realize is,

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.130
when you have an impact at high speed,

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:46.580
it's not like you're throwing
a stone into a brick wall,

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.940
you know, and it makes a
hole and sticks in there.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.066
Or just bounces off.

00:08:50.066 --> 00:08:51.610
It's explosive.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:52.700
It's like totally explosive.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.680
So the kinetic energy of the projectile

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.369
comes in maybe 30 kilometers per second.

00:08:57.369 --> 00:09:00.200
The kinetic energy of the
projectile is big enough

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.220
to completely vaporize the projectile.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.690
It turns it into a gas.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.266
And that gas is super hot
and super high pressure,

00:09:06.266 --> 00:09:09.075
and it explodes and it
blows out the crater.

00:09:09.075 --> 00:09:11.923
So the projectile doesn't
really exist after the impact.

00:09:11.923 --> 00:09:14.297
I mean, little pieces can survive.

00:09:14.297 --> 00:09:18.314
But this 50 meter body
was basically obliterated.

00:09:18.314 --> 00:09:22.245
So he was looking for
something that did not exist.

00:09:22.245 --> 00:09:25.890
- He spent 27 years mining the crater,

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:29.600
drilling down to a depth
of over 400 meters.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.596
But what he was searching
for had vaporized on impact

00:09:32.596 --> 00:09:35.309
50,000 years earlier.

00:09:35.309 --> 00:09:37.692
The 50 meter asteroid,

00:09:37.692 --> 00:09:39.972
not that much bigger than Chelyabinsk,

00:09:39.972 --> 00:09:44.955
released the energy equivalent
of 10 megatons of TNT.

00:09:44.955 --> 00:09:49.435
That's over 600 times the
energy of the Hiroshima bomb.

00:09:49.435 --> 00:09:52.400
So, the thing that most closely resembles

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.948
a meteorite impact is a very
large nuclear explosion.

00:09:56.948 --> 00:09:59.281
(explosion)

00:10:06.565 --> 00:10:09.910
- This is the actual
size of the T-Rex skull.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:13.070
And I thought, this is such a
cool thing, I gotta have it.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.763
So, I bought the T-Rex.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.723
The dinosaurs were wiped out by

00:10:17.723 --> 00:10:20.283
a 10 kilometer size asteroid,

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.640
that hit about 65 million years ago.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.570
So, above a critical size,

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.415
which is probably a couple of kilometers,

00:10:28.415 --> 00:10:31.789
an impacter delivers so much energy

00:10:31.789 --> 00:10:33.684
that it has a global effect.

00:10:33.684 --> 00:10:36.017
(explosion)

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.968
So essentially, it launches
a whole bunch of debris

00:10:41.968 --> 00:10:44.370
into sub orbital trajectory.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.110
So the ejector goes around the earth,

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.450
falls back into the earth, all over,

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.870
even on the other side of the planet

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:52.420
from where the impact occurred.

00:10:53.911 --> 00:10:56.674
And what that means is
the whole sky lights up

00:10:56.674 --> 00:10:59.003
with wall-to-wall meteors.

00:11:00.501 --> 00:11:03.660
So you can imagine the sky
turning from, you know,

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.433
a nice blue day like today,

00:11:05.433 --> 00:11:08.470
into essentially a red, hot glow,

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.283
like being inside a toaster oven.

00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:14.198
So the first effect of this impact

00:11:14.198 --> 00:11:16.120
apart from the initial blast

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.060
near where the actual impact occurred,

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.788
the first effect is the sky

00:11:19.788 --> 00:11:22.122
turns into a great source of heat,

00:11:22.122 --> 00:11:23.870
and it cooks everything on the ground.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.790
So these guys were basically cooked.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:27.623
- Cooked alive.

00:11:27.623 --> 00:11:29.690
- Cooked alive, as they
were walking around.

00:11:30.767 --> 00:11:32.490
The only animals that had a chance

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.519
were the ones living in
tunnels under the ground

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:37.583
or maybe in the water.

00:11:37.583 --> 00:11:40.260
And they were able to
come back and take over

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.040
without having to deal with the dinosaurs

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.850
as a major obstacle.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.303
- What are our chances that earth gets hit

00:11:47.303 --> 00:11:51.593
by another 10 kilometer
or bigger asteroid?

00:11:51.593 --> 00:11:55.410
- In your lifetime, assuming
you live to be 100 years old,

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:57.170
you have a 10 kilometer impacter

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:59.111
like the KT extinction event

00:11:59.111 --> 00:12:02.750
every hundred million years
or something like that.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.940
So the probability of
getting it in one year

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.730
is one in a hundred million.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.150
So you have one in a million chance

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.560
of dying from a 10 kilometer impact.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.838
But, because we know that there are no

00:12:12.838 --> 00:12:15.442
10 kilometer impacters

00:12:15.442 --> 00:12:17.586
with a path that intersects the earth

00:12:17.586 --> 00:12:19.550
for the next hundred years,

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:21.902
your chance of dying from
that is actually zero.

00:12:21.902 --> 00:12:25.150
So work done already has
reduced that down, you know,

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.963
from one in a million to nothing.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.040
- So the good news is,

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.160
there won't be another
dinosaur style extinction event

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.323
in our lifetimes.

00:12:33.323 --> 00:12:36.883
But, there are
exponentially more asteroids

00:12:36.883 --> 00:12:38.381
of smaller sizes.

00:12:38.381 --> 00:12:40.749
For every 10 kilometer asteroid,

00:12:40.749 --> 00:12:44.391
there are roughly a thousand
one kilometer asteroids,

00:12:44.391 --> 00:12:48.863
and they're still capable
of doing a lot of damage.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.752
- One or two kilometers

00:12:51.752 --> 00:12:55.540
is capable of causing
local, but massive damage.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:56.950
So that means, you know,

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.730
instead of wiping out the entire world,

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.100
you would wipe out the equivalent of

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.780
some European country,
like France or Germany,

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.350
to mention two of my favorites.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:10.230
So you would obliterate those countries

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:13.400
with the impact of a one
or two kilometer size body.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.260
- Do we know about all the

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.870
one to two kilometer
bodies that could hit us?

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.530
- We think that we know
90-something percent.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:24.752
Maybe 98% of those bodies
have been identified,

00:13:24.752 --> 00:13:26.710
and we have their orbits,

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.350
and we can make reasonable predictions

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:32.660
for the next 10 years of
something about where there'll be.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.833
And we seem to be okay at
the moment, but you know,

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.020
what about the ones that are just

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.774
a little bit less than a kilometer?

00:13:39.774 --> 00:13:41.500
What about the ones that are 800 meters?

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.570
That's still pretty,
pretty savage if it hits.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.140
- And this is possibly where

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.110
the greatest threat of asteroids remains.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.290
A few hundred meters is large enough

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.136
to obliterate a large city.

00:13:53.136 --> 00:13:57.210
But small enough that we
haven't detected them all yet.

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:00.810
- We're missing a lot of
hundred meter size projectiles.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:04.086
And those guys are big enough
to cause substantial damage

00:14:04.086 --> 00:14:06.370
on the earth, depending on where they hit.

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:07.800
- So it could destroy a city.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.090
- Yeah. It would knock down
the buildings in the city.

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.510
It would cause city-wide fire.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:14.610
And if it hit the ground,

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:18.300
it would throw up ejecta
that would come back down,

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.600
rain on the ground, it
would be high-speed ejecta,

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.694
that would obliterate a hundred
kilometer zone around it.

00:14:24.694 --> 00:14:27.683
- And this could happen tomorrow?

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.182
- Well it could, yeah.

00:14:30.182 --> 00:14:32.710
(chuckling nervously)

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:35.003
- If we saw a big one coming,

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:37.630
what's our best bet for, I mean,

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:38.770
could we do anything about it?

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:39.872
What would we do about it?

00:14:39.872 --> 00:14:40.705
- [Prof. Jewitt] No.

00:14:40.705 --> 00:14:41.872
- Is there anything we
can do to actively ...

00:14:41.872 --> 00:14:44.390
- No. There's nothing we can do.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:45.970
I was on a committee that
looked at that, okay,

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.201
like 10 years ago, like, what could we do?

00:14:48.201 --> 00:14:50.750
One option would be to try to bomb it.

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.298
It's a standard thing.

00:14:52.298 --> 00:14:54.216
We don't know how that would work out.

00:14:54.216 --> 00:14:55.510
Even when you got it there,

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:57.310
and even if you could explode it,

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:59.620
on the surface or in the surface,

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:00.990
it's not clear what you would do,

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:02.930
because typically what happens is you

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:06.330
blow up a body, and
the fragments move out.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.171
They expand out, but not very quickly.

00:15:08.171 --> 00:15:10.330
And then gravity pulls
them back together again.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.100
So it would reform as a rubble pile.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.530
If it was not already a
rubble pile to begin with,

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.838
which it probably would be
because of past impacts.

00:15:17.838 --> 00:15:19.738
So blowing up a rubble pile

00:15:19.738 --> 00:15:22.087
is something that we
don't really know about.

00:15:22.087 --> 00:15:24.130
Another idea is you could attach,

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:24.980
you could be all gentle,

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.247
and attach a rocket to the asteroid,

00:15:27.247 --> 00:15:28.649
and just try to push it aside.

00:15:28.649 --> 00:15:30.660
Just nudge it aside, instead
of trying to blow it up,

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.520
let's just push it gently aside,

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.390
so that it deflects it and
it doesn't hit the earth.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.590
The trouble is, when you
work out the numbers,

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.330
none of the rockets that we
have can push it around enough.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.850
You would have to keep the
rockets attached to the surface,

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:43.730
which we don't know how to do.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.410
Remember, it's a rotating body,

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:48.400
for centuries, to have
a significant effect

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.570
on the motion of the asteroids.

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:53.790
So forget bombs, forget attaching rockets.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:54.670
Ablating the surface,

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:56.530
basically you boil the
surface with a laser.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:58.760
We don't have any lasers powerful enough

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.050
and probably can't make
lasers powerful enough

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:03.340
to do that from the earth.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.300
We would have to take
the lasers to the object,

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.910
which is even more difficult.

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:08.788
The idea that you could wrap an asteroid

00:16:08.788 --> 00:16:12.110
in cooking foil, aluminum
cooking foils, another nice one.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.626
It may be a good one, the best one.

00:16:13.626 --> 00:16:15.350
But it still doesn't really work

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.070
because we don't know how to do that.

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.583
We don't have a way to launch

00:16:18.583 --> 00:16:21.910
enough cooking foil to wrap up an asteroid

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.760
and change its radiative properties

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.550
which would itself move
the asteroid around.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:28.270
So the truth is, to be honest,

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:31.801
we do not have a way now to deflect

00:16:31.801 --> 00:16:35.240
a kilometer size asteroid, at all.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.860
- That could destroy a country.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:37.897
- [Prof. Jewitt] Yeah,
we just don't have a way.

00:16:37.897 --> 00:16:39.290
- And 10 kilometers?

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.167
- 10 kilometers is absolutely

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.929
a thousand times more hopeless.

00:16:42.929 --> 00:16:43.762
(laughing)

00:16:43.762 --> 00:16:46.040
So, when we discuss this, you know,

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.452
we had all these grand ideas.

00:16:47.452 --> 00:16:49.795
"Oh, we could do this and
this," and none of them worked.

00:16:49.795 --> 00:16:52.070
We came down to the most basic idea, well,

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.210
maybe if we could figure out

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.650
where the asteroid is gonna hit,

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:57.170
like which city is it gonna explode over,

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:58.937
we can evacuate that city.

00:16:58.937 --> 00:17:01.785
And then we looked at the
history of city evacuations,

00:17:01.785 --> 00:17:04.055
and we looked at cases, you know where,

00:17:04.055 --> 00:17:06.550
for example, you have
like a week's warning,

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:09.135
where some hurricane
system is gonna come in

00:17:09.135 --> 00:17:10.623
and flood a city.

00:17:10.623 --> 00:17:14.493
And evacuation just doesn't work either.

00:17:14.493 --> 00:17:16.430
And the reason is very, very simple.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.810
Going into a city, there
are not that many freeways.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:22.540
If you have millions of people
trying to get on a freeway,

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.960
the first time a car breaks
down, you block that freeway.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.120
So instantly, you have millions of people

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.370
trying to get out of the target zone,

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.649
and they won't be able to
because all of the roads

00:17:32.649 --> 00:17:35.150
will be instantly blocked.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.430
So again, even that, even
evacuation of a city,

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:42.680
is probably the most hopeful
thing that we could try to do.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.209
Even that's really, really difficult,

00:17:44.209 --> 00:17:47.272
because of the large
numbers of people involved.

00:17:47.272 --> 00:17:50.572
What I think all reasonable
people would conclude is,

00:17:50.572 --> 00:17:53.990
let's do the thing that we can do first.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.883
So let's look for them.

00:17:54.883 --> 00:17:56.440
Let's do the surveys.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.646
Let's build the telescopes.

00:17:57.646 --> 00:17:59.510
Let's put this telescope in space.

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:02.010
That will be a major contribution

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.780
to understanding the
threat from the asteroids.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.390
And then when we find a particular object

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:11.960
that looks especially dangerous,
then we can focus on it.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.016
We can focus everything we have on it,

00:18:14.016 --> 00:18:17.171
and we can begin to think
seriously and with real motivation

00:18:17.171 --> 00:18:19.403
about ways to deflect it.

00:18:20.494 --> 00:18:23.300
- Now, if you're concerned
about the world ending

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.945
in an asteroid impact, let
me set your mind at ease.

00:18:26.945 --> 00:18:30.331
There are many other
potential global catastrophes

00:18:30.331 --> 00:18:34.310
summarized in this map of
doom made by my friend Dom,

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:36.250
over at Domain of Science.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.088
So if you wanna see which
of these horrible scenarios

00:18:38.088 --> 00:18:40.403
is likeliest to be our downfall,

00:18:40.403 --> 00:18:42.954
well go check out the
video on his channel.

00:18:42.954 --> 00:18:46.204
(sci-fi sound effects)

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.520
My oldest now knows how
to do the sponsor message.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.720
Do you wanna say it?

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.857
This episode ...

00:18:52.857 --> 00:18:55.155
- [Kid] Is sponsored by KiwiCo.

00:18:55.155 --> 00:18:56.230
(chuckling)

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.450
- Very good.

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:02.090
KiwiCo creates awesome projects
and toys to get kids making.

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:04.992
They offer eight subscription
lines for kids of all ages,

00:19:04.992 --> 00:19:07.218
all the way down to newborns.

00:19:07.218 --> 00:19:09.720
And with the holidays
right around the corner,

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.004
KiwiCo is the perfect gift idea.

00:19:12.004 --> 00:19:15.670
As a parent, I know that
lots of gifts get unwrapped

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.252
and played with for a little while,

00:19:17.252 --> 00:19:19.370
but then kids lose interest.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:22.570
But a KiwiCo crate subscription
will keep kids engaged,

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:24.970
learning, and making throughout the year.

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:26.760
Now I use their crates with my sons,

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.605
and they are a lot of fun
while also being educational.

00:19:29.605 --> 00:19:32.700
And I want my kids to see
learning as a form of play.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.597
And KiwiCo really helps me do that.

00:19:34.597 --> 00:19:37.110
Plus all the supplies you
need come right in the box,

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.600
so you never need to run out to the store.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.504
Now here, I built a perpetual calendar.

00:19:42.504 --> 00:19:46.100
A reminder that each passing
day brings the chance

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.110
of an asteroid impact.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.300
For viewers of this video,

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.846
KiwiCo is offering 50% off
your first month of any crate.

00:19:52.846 --> 00:19:55.650
Just go to kiwico.com/veritasium50,

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:58.320
and I'll put that link
down in the description.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.730
So I wanna thank KiwiCo
for sponsoring Veritasium,

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:02.683
and I wanna thank you for watching.
