00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.340
Which is most effective for helping people
learn: punishment or reward?

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.470
Well, consider the case of Israeli fighter
pilot training, because instructors there

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.130
found that negative feedback was far superior
to positive feedback.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.780
If a cadet performed a particularly poor maneuver
they would reprimand him.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.720
But they noticed that on follow up attempts,
his performance invariably improved.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.660
In contrast, if they praised a cadet for executing
a skillful maneuver, his performance on subsequent

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.720
attempts typically declined.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.190
So naturally they concluded that positive
feedback is ineffective or even detrimental

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.640
whereas negative feedback is what works.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.430
The problem is this seems to contradict a
body of research that shows positive feedback

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.350
is actually more effective than negative feedback.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.380
For example, in studies involving teachers
it was found that if a teacher increase the

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.280
ratio of positive feedback to negative feedback,
that actually increases the percentage of

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.760
times students spend on task.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.860
In another study rugby players were given
a video feedback session following a game,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.670
except half of them were shown their highlights
and they were praised for what they had done

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.290
and the other half were shown their biggest
blunders, their mistakes.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.350
And they were scolded for doing things incorrectly.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.340
Now a week later at the next game, it was
the players who had received the positive

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.652
reinforcement who performed the best.

00:01:15.652 --> 00:01:19.720
And, in fact, the difference was not just
psychological.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.590
Blood tests revealed that the players who
received positive feedback actually had higher

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.170
levels of testosterone than players who had
received the negative feedback.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.890
I think that is quite remarkable that even
a week post feedback you could still see a

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.740
physiological difference between the two types
of feedback.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.740
Wow.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.520
Well so why didn't this work for the Israeli
fighter pilots?

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.619
Well, maybe there are cultural differences
and in some cultures negative feedback works

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:46.619
better.

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.770
Or maybe it is task dependent.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.259
Perhaps some skills like learning to fly a
fighter jet require more negative feedback.

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.229
Or maybe the feedback had nothing to do with
the performance of the fighter pilots at all.

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.079
Maybe they would have performed in the same
way regardless of the feedback they received.

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.939
Go with me on this.

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:10.440
Imagine you have 100 students taking a test
which consists of 100 true or false questions

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.690
on a subject they know nothing about.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.569
Now assuming they all answer randomly, we
know that the resulting distribution of scores

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.120
will have an average of around 50.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.819
But just by chance, some students will have
scored significantly better or worse than

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:25.819
the average.

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:26.819
&gt;&gt; Oh, man.

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.720
&gt;&gt; If you select the top 10 students whose
scores were all above 50 and gave them a second

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.390
very similar test, you would find that the
average of their scores would drop back to

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.810
around 50.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.430
Similarly, if you selected the bottom 10 students,
their score on a subsequent test would rise

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.620
to 50.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.030
This is just regression to the mean.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.650
Regression to the mean is the reason why if
you have a really good round of golf today,

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.880
your round tomorrow will not be as good.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.430
Yes.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.270
That is because random chance plays a role
in virtually everything that we do.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.849
So the outcomes of events are influenced by
both our skill and a little bit of luck.

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.099
So if you have especially good luck on one
day, chances are your level of luck will not

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.040
be as good the next day.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.080
Now that sounds a little bit like the gamblers
fallacy, which states that past events influence

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.349
future probabilities.

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.080
For example, if you flip a coin and it comes
up tails a couple of times, the gamblers fallacy

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.190
is to expect the probability of heads to increase
for the next flip.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.190
In reality it doesn’t.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.190
It is still 50-50.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.739
The idea wit the gamblers fallacy is that
probabilities change so that overall things

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.209
over out in the long run.

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.769
That is the idea.

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.459
With regression to the mean, it is not that
things are evening out, it is just that extreme

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.489
events are becoming diluted by the average
events which happen much more commonly.

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.840
Now with these students they were completely
guessing on every question.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.550
But even when you know something about the
subject, there is still going to be there

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.989
that element of chance.

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.400
And so regression to the mean always occurs,
just to a lesser extent.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.910
This is really important to consider in research.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.190
Imagine you are trialing a new drug to help
prevent heart disease.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.130
So from a sample of patients you select those
in the bottom 10 percent of heart health indicators,

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.260
people with high blood pressure, high cholesterol,
that sort of thing.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.640
Now after a month of being on a drug, you
test them again to find that their scores

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.650
have improved.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.810
Well, great, the drug is working, right?

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:19.940
Well, maybe not.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.960
See, the trouble is that although blood pressure
and cholesterol are more stable than, say,

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.620
your score on a random true or false test,
there is still some inherent variability caused

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.240
by, say, your level of stress on the day or
your recent diet or even the uncertainties

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.150
introduced by the measuring apparatus.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.180
So the people who ended up in the bottom 10
percent on the first test, likely had these

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.810
factors all count against them.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.330
They were particularly unlucky.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.830
But you should not expect them to be as unlucky
when you test them a second time.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.680
So their scores should improve just based
on random chance.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.960
That is why it is so important that clinical
trials use control groups drawn from exactly

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.020
the same population so that you can see whether
the drug improves scores more than random

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.990
chance alone would.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.990
Or what about the assessing the impact of
speed cameras?

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.560
When they are first installed, they are normally
put in locations that have had a high volume

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.850
of accidents in the previous year or two.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:11.850
Makes sense.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.270
Now those accidents are likely due, at least
in part, to bad road design, but also due,

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.730
at least in part, to bad luck.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.590
And so you shouldn’t be surprised that after
a speed camera is installed the number of

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.730
accidents goes down.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.910
It would go down anyway simply due to regression
to the mean.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.540
Meanwhile somewhere else that previously had
a small number of accidents will likely have

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.540
more.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.350
So the overall accident rate may not change
and yet we will feel as though our investment

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.370
in road safety has paid off.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.479
But perhaps what is most troubling about regression
to the mean is how it influences our perception

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:48.860
of feedback.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.430
For example, with the fighter pilots, after
they execute a maneuver particularly poorly

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.990
chances are the next attempt is going to be
better, regardless of the feedback they receive.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.030
Similarly, after an especially successful
display, chances are the next attempt is not

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.780
going to be as good.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.270
And that has nothing to do with the feedback
and everything to do with the statistical

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.130
nature of our universe.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:16.420
But we are hard wired to see patterns and
causality everywhere, which is why the instructors

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:21.790
felt that positive feedback was detrimental
and negative feedback is what works.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.789
And this is really unfortunate, because that
is the exact opposite of what well controlled

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:28.169
psychological studies show.

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:32.130
You know, I think it is really unfortunate
that if you give negative feedback, chances

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.940
are you will be rewarded.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.500
They will do better.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.030
And if you give positive feedback, chances
are you will be disappointed, because it is

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.949
difficult to maintain that level of luck.

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:45.480
But that is the way our world is.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.380
So think about that next time before you tell
someone off.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:54.830
If you stay positive, it may just work out
for the best in the long run.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:01.669
This video was inspired by the book Thinking
Fast and Slow by Nobel prize winning economist

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:03.210
Daniel Kahneman.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.250
So that was the first time I heard of the
Israeli fighter pilot training and really

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.710
started thinking about regression to the mean.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.080
It was pretty awesome and I downloaded this
book from Audible, so I was listening to it

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.080
on my travels.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.680
I am currently at the Perimeter Institute,
which you can see has some beautiful black

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.680
boards.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.410
Now if you want to listen to this book, you
can download it for free by going to Audible.com/Veritasium

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.190
or you can listen to any other book of your
choice for a one month free trial.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.052
So thanks to Audible for supporting to me.

00:07:29.052 --> 00:07:32.400
Thanks to Perimeter Institute for putting
me up in this amazing location.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.530
And I will see you next time with some theoretical
physics ideas.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:36.440
So stay tuned for that.
