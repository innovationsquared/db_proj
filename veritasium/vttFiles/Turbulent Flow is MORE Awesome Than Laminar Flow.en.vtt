A portion of this video was sponsored by loda

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.240
This is like a scientist trap.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.840
It certainly is; case in point, that is Space Station commander Chris Hadfield

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.360
What this isn't is turbulent. Nope, this is largely laminar flow.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.560
“Did somebody say peculiar flow! ?”

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.600
no i dont

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.080
If you didn't know, Destin from smarter every day loves laminar flow,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.600
where all the particles of the fluid move parallel to each other in organized layers or laminae

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.240
look at that it made a bubble!!!

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.960
 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.840
Where I live people will roll down the window in their car when they see me in the street

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.520
and they will scream “turbulent flow” to me

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.560
That happens, that happens in Huntsville. Yeah.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.440
Here- Here's my argument to you, Destin

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.640
nashe

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.040
Okay.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.800
but turbulent flow if you make that effort is actually more awesome.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.740
Um...

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.120
no.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.440
Turbulent flow is not better than laminar. It is awesome

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.720
But it is not better than laminar flow.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.800
Can I just say I get it

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.360
I get where Destin is coming from

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.120
I mean laminar flow is pretty and it's well behaved,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.840
Meanwhile turbulent flow is a mess in more ways than one.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.220
I mean, there isn't even a universally agreed-upon definition of turbulent flow.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.580
You know it when you see it

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.300
[Laughing]

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.520
Hahaha, So that's the deal with turbulence, you know it when you see it?

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.600
Pretty much. Yeah.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.920
So instead of a formal definition, in this video

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.440
we are going to build a checklist of characteristics of turbulent flow,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.440
so that you know it when you see it

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.520
and the first characteristic of turbulent flow is that it is unpredictable

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.560
That's right. Turbulent flow is messy it's unpredictable.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.720
It is literally definitionally chaotic

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.160
meaning it is sensitively dependent on initial conditions.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.280
So if you were to change something somewhere in the fluid

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.360
well, it would completely change the final state

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.560
and that means you can't make predictions with turbulent flow

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.520
All you can do is speak about it statistically.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.920
I mean, there are the Navier-Stokes equations which are meant to govern all fluid flow

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.800
Including turbulence, but they are notoriously difficult to solve.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.520
In fact, there is a million-dollar prize

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:29.000
for anyone who can even make progress towards getting insight into these equations that would explain turbulence,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.360
so yeah, I get it, turbulence is a mess，

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.520
laminar flow is easy to love

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.160
It's like the bell of a ball

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.320
whereas turbulent flow is kind of an ugly duckling

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.800
But in this video I want to transform that ugly duckling into a beautiful swan

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.520
I want you to see that if you make the effort

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:54.600
The love you can have for turbulent flow is so much deeper and richer than that superficial fling you have with laminar flow

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.920
You are looking at the motion of air in a room, which is generally turbulent

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.080
the physics girl and friends imaged a cross-section of air using a fog machine and a laser sheet

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.040
one of the defining characteristics of turbulent flow is that

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.400
it consists of many interacting swirls of fluid also called Eddies or Vortices

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.080
These eddies span a huge range of sizes

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.400
In the case of air in a room, from the micrometer scale all the way up to meters in diameter

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.080
Can you think of another physical phenomenon that exhibits structures over such a range of sizes?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.600
But turbulence can be much larger.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.520
The surface of the Sun is turbulent as hot plasma rises to the surface in huge convection currents.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.800
The cell like structures here are roughly the size of Texas

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.000
Larger still are the turbulent swirls on Jupiter.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.280
The Great Red Spot is a vortex bigger than the Earth

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.320
The rest of the planet is covered in Eddie's of all sizes

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.020
down to the limits of our ability to measure them from orbiting spacecraft

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.920
Even the dust between the stars is in turbulent motion

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.360
It makes radio sources twinkle the same way the turbulence in our atmosphere makes stars twinkle

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:23.160
a stunning example of this turbulent dust is the Orion Nebula: twenty four light years across

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:30.080
Turbulence is cosmic. In contrast, laminar flow has to be small.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.200
This was shown experimentally in 1883.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.400
Osborne Reynolds passed water through a glass pipe at different flow rates

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.080
and to visualize the flow, he introduced a stream of dye in the middle of the pipe

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.000
He found at low flow rates the dye remained in a steady stream: laminar flow

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.560
but as the flow rate increased the dye began to oscillate back and forth

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.320
and beyond a certain critical point, the dye became completely diffused throughout the pipe.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.320
This was turbulent flow.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.720
Reynolds had observed another essential characteristic of turbulence,

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.920
It is diffusive, meaning it mixes things together

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.360
Turbulent flows caused things to spread out

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.840
not only dye, but also heat or momentum

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.680
They all become distributed throughout the fluid

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.840
Reynolds found the transition to turbulence was not only dependent on the flow rate

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.040
turbulence occurred more readily in wider pipes

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.680
But less readily with more viscous fluids, things like honey

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.040
He calculated a dimensionless quantity now called the Reynolds number

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.840
Equal to the velocity of the fluid times the characteristic length, say the diameter of the pipe

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.720
Divided by the kinematic viscosity of the fluid

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.200
which you can think of as a measure of its internal friction

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.920
high Reynolds numbers result in turbulent flow

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.800
Have a look at the smoke rising from a candle flame

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.440
At first, it's laminar. But the hot gases accelerate as they rise,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.320
and once the Reynolds number gets too big the smoke transitions to turbulence

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.720
so laminar flow only occurs at low Reynolds numbers

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.400
Which means it is limited to low speeds small sizes or viscous fluids

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.520
This is why in our everyday lives most fluid flow is turbulent

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.480
Turbulent flow is the rule.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.480
Laminar flow is the exception.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.720
The air flowing in and out of your lungs is turbulent,

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.320
the blood pumping through your aorta is turbulent

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.680
the Atmosphere near the surface of the earth is turbulent

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.240
as is the air flow in and around cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.760
In fact modeling shows that turbulent flow plays an essential role in the formation of rain drops

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.480
so turbulence literally makes it rain.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.380
[Thunder crashes, Rain sounds]

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.760
I'm going to create turbulence in this rheoscopic fluid

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.040
Rheoscopic just means that it shows the currents

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.200
and it does that by having these tiny particles suspended in the water

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.280
But what you notice if you look at this turbulent flow is that it gradually dies away

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.080
And that's because another characteristic of turbulence is that it's dissipative

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.800
That is it takes in energy at the largest scales at these big eddies,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.920
and then that energy gets transferred down to smaller and smaller eddies

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.440
until on the smallest scales that energy gets dissipated to the fluid as heat

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.880
And so in order to maintain turbulence

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.840
You need a constant source of energy, something to keep generating those large eddies,

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.400
which is why we often think about turbulence around objects that move through a fluid

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.960
things like planes cars or boats.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.440
So I want to think about the interface between an object and the fluid.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.120
So picture fluid flowing over a flat surface

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:54.680
far away from the surface, the fluid isn't affected. It keeps moving with what will call its free stream velocity

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.600
But right at the surface，due to friction and adhesion

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.520
The molecules of the fluid are effectively stuck to the surface. Their velocity is zero.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:09.320
The fluid next to it can flow only slowly due to friction with this stationary layer

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:17.480
with increasing distance from the surface，the fluids velocity increases from zero until it reaches the free stream velocity

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.400
and this region of velocity adjustment is known as a boundary layer.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.200
In this case, it's a laminar boundary layer

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.440
To form this boundary layer, the surface is applying a force to the fluid

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:37.000
That means the fluid is applying an equal and opposite force on the surface

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.880
and this is known as skin friction

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.880
Now if the fluid velocity is particularly fast or if the surface is long

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.680
the boundary layer will grow and eventually transition to turbulence

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:59.240
in a turbulent boundary layer，the fluid swirls and mixes bringing faster flowing fluid closer to the surface

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.360
and this increases the skin friction

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:07.200
so turbulent boundary layers result in significantly more drag than laminar ones

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.080
and the boundary layers around planes and large ships are mostly turbulent

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.760
and skin friction accounts for the majority of the drag they experience

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:24.200
to make matters worse laminar boundary layers can be tripped into becoming turbulent by small obstacles or rough surfaces

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:30.320
in practice this means clean smooth surfaces can significantly reduce drag saving on fuel costs

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:35.680
If your car is really dirty, it likely gets worse gas mileage than if it were clean

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.040
This is what the Mythbusters found when they tested it.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.600
It also explains why planes are frequently washed

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:49.040
So when you think about airplanes, I imagine that they would be built as smooth as possible

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.840
I think of the scene in The Aviator

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.800
where Leo says he wants all of the rivets shaved down flush

00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:01.080
and you can see that with this plane all of these screws are are set in to the wing

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.680
and really to make the smoothest surface possible,

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:10.560
but then you look over here and there are these ridges that stick up out of the plane,

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.760
which seem to make no sense

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.880
I mean, why would you add roughness to the surface of the wing?

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:23.800
the answer is actually to induce turbulence in the flow of air over the wing

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:28.240
when cruising in level flight, air smoothly follows the curve of the wing

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.600
but at low speeds or higher angles of attack the airflow can separate

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.840
you can think of it as not having enough energy to follow the curve of the wing

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.680
This leads to a condition known as stall which dramatically decreases lift

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.120
Here you can see the airflow of via strings taped onto the wing

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.080
and as the plane slows the flow separates

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.440
and the strings go wild

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.120
This plane has stalled.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:02.040
The way to delay flow separation and stall is by adding small fins on the wing called vortex generators

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.480
What these vortex generators do, is they actually cause turbulence

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.640
which mixes the faster flowing higher up air down closer to the surface

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.760
so you're energizing that fluid flow as it passes over the wing

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:22.200
and because that flow has greater energy it is able to follow the surface of the wing for longer

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.120
That means the air flow remains attached

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.000
and if you have attached airflow over the wing then you can maintain lift

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.360
so in the case of airplanes

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:37.200
You actually need turbulence and you induce more turbulence on the wing

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:43.360
in order to fly efficiently and effectively and be able to climb at higher angles of attack.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.200
A similar principle is at work with golf balls.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.960
The Scott found out about turbulence the hard way

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.560
because they started playing with a very smooth golfball

00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:00.320
and it wouldn't fly as far as it would once it got sort of dimple nicked and dirty

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.880
you can see why by observing the airflow in a wind tunnel

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.560
with a smooth ball the air forms a laminar boundary layer over its surface

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.640
this leads to low skin friction, which is a good thing

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.080
But it also means the air flow separates easily

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:19.400
leaving a large wake of low pressure turbulent air behind the ball

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.120
and that leads to a different form of drag.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.120
Is that a pressure difference drag?

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.400
That's right, that's a pressure drag.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:31.840
So the boundary layer itself has a skin friction drag and then if it separates there's a pressure drag

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.280
And if you force that boundary layer to become turbulent

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.280
So you have mud or roughness or mix on the golf ball

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:45.600
then a turbulent boundary like this can get further around the golf ball before it separates

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.920
And so it reduces that wake and reduces that pressure drag.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:54.920
So by reducing the pressure drag to more than your increase in this kind of drag, golf ball travels further

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.520
Yep!

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.520
Golfers started carving grooves into their golf balls

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.440
before the aerodynamics of this was fully understood

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.880
And since then dimples have found to work the best for creating a turbulent boundary layer

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:12.400
Dimples are very shallow compared to the diameter of the golf ball, but they have a pretty massive effect

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.080
What sort of effect are we talking?

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.360
Looking at the drag, and we call it drag coefficient

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:24.120
You see a really big drop almost a factor of two when the boundary layer becomes turbulent.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.640
So having a turbulent boundary layer reduces the size of the turbulent wake

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.400
but turbulent wakes themselves are interesting and

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:37.000
scientists are looking for ways to harness the energy they contain

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.400
I came to Caltech to see this experiment

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.760
where the water flows around a cylinder and transitions to turbulence in its wake

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.720
The flow is visualized here using a fluorescent dye

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.240
You can see how under the right conditions

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.760
Vortices are shed by one side of the cylinder, and then the other,

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.040
alternating back and forth in a regular pattern

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.480
This is known as periodic vortex shedding

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:05.920
and the pattern it creates downstream is called a von Karman Vortex Street

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:12.480
These patterns appear all over the place, most spectacularly in images taken from space

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.800
At this scale, an Island acts as the obstacle that creates the periodic vortex shedding

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.840
and the vortex street is made visible by patterns in the clouds

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.160
These patterns can even be seen from ground level

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.200
Obviously this phenomenon is not strictly turbulent because it follows a predictable pattern

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.360
but it is part of the transition to turbulence

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:39.520
and these scientists are looking for ways to harness the energy in these vortex structures

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:44.200
One experiment showed that if you put a dead fish in the wake of an object

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.080
it will actually swim upstream

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:53.680
This suggests fish can take advantage of turbulent water to swim more efficiently

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.960
It's just one way that animals have adapted to live in a turbulent world

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.360
So to sum up, turbulence is everywhere,

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:07.240
it's inside you around you from the smallest scales up to the largest structures in the universe

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.840
and it's useful for flying airplanes, forming raindrops,

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:15.720
making golf balls fly further, and helping fish, dead or alive, swim upstream

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:21.920
In contrast, laminar flow is small, superficial, it's a toy

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.440
That's why it's most notable use is in decorative fountains

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:31.360
It appeals to your desire for order, but the world like turbulence is messy

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:38.440
That's why I personally prefer the richness, the unpredictability of turbulent flow

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.360
No, but but turbulent flow has its places too.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.600
I'm actually like studying turbulent flow for like my my schooling,

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:50.600
Like I'm studying turbulent flow in rocket nozzles. That's a thing.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.840
So cheating on laminar flow, is what are you doing.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:58.000
Um, no, yes. Yes, maybe, I don't know

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.440
But I wonder you will not get me to say turbulent flow is not awesome and not beautiful, you will not get me to say that

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:09.560
So I will concede and I agree with you turbulent flow is awesome. I will agree

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.000
All right. All right.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.760
Well it's just not as awesome as laminar flow. Let's be honest

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.720
Hey, I just wanted to let you know that this video was filmed

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.560
before the COVID outbreak and before the shelter-in-place guidance was put into effect

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.160
Now this portion of the video was sponsored by Cottonelle flushable wipes

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:35.200
and since the outbreak they have been working around the clock to get their products back on shelves

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:40.840
And back when I filmed this video I actually did a little experiment with these wipes to find out how flushable they really are

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.640
So let's check that out

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:48.080
So here I have a baby wipe, a paper towel, and a Cottonelle flushable wipe

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.880
and I'm gonna submerge all three of these in the fish tank for 30 minutes

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.480
and then test how strong they are

00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:00.000
Flushable wipes actually became really important to me a couple years ago

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.960
When the main sewer for my building backed up into my condo and flooded the entire downstairs

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:13.560
And the reason was my neighbor was flushing baby wipes down the toilet and that blocked up the whole system

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.000
So it was pretty awful.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
But in fact, this is a thing people do a lot

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.960
There was this study from 2016 that found in the US

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.680
60 million baby wipes are purchased every year

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.360
and seven million of them end up being flushed down the toilet

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.800
In fact when they looked in the New York City sewer system

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:35.960
They found that 38 percent of the stuff you find in there is actually these baby wipes

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.720
Meanwhile, 14 million flushable wipes are purchased every year and flushed down toilets

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:44.760
But they make up only 2% of what you find in the sewer system

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:51.160
So I think it's so important that whatever you throw in the toilet has to be able to break apart so it doesn't clog everything up.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:56.600
Okay, 30 minutes have elapsed and it is time to test the strength of these three wipes

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.320
So I'm gonna test their strength with a roll of pennies.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.880
Here we go on the baby wipe

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.000
It can still support that weight.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.080
What about the paper towel?

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.400
Still supports that weight

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.120
What about the Cottonelle flushable wipe?

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.720
Ah!

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.080
It fell through

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.120
so this is what makes the Cottonelle flushable wipe flushable

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.720
it immediately starts to break down after flushing

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:26.640
So you should purchase some cotton nail flushable wipes and try them out for yourself

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.120
I want to thank Cottonelle for sponsoring this video,

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.920
And I want to thank you for watching
