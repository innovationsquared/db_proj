00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.210
You have made your prediction and now it is
time to see what happens when I release the

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.240
balance.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.280
Ready?

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.990
In three, two, one.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.150
The balance tips towards the right, towards
the hanging, heavier ball.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.570
But why does this happen?

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.640
Well, the best way I can think of to explain
this is that both balls displace the same

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.070
amount of water.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.030
So they both experience the same upward buoyant
force which is equal to the weight of the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.030
water they displace.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.090
That is just Archimedes Principle.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.820
But by Newtonâ€™s Third Law, that means there
must be equal and opposite forces down on

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.650
the water in both beakers.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.220
So you would think that both beakers would
get heavier by this same amount.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.260
Now for the hanging ball the beaker does get
heavier by this amount, because the buoyant

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.690
force is now supporting some of the weight
that used to be supported by this tension

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.690
in the string.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.610
But it is now reduced and so beaker actually
has more weight.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.259
But for the ping pong ball, the downward force
on the water is almost entirely counteracted

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.619
by the upward force of the tension in that
string on the bottom of the beaker.

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.700
And, therefore, the weight of this beaker
only increases by the weight of the ping pong

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.520
ball itself, whereas for the hanging ball
the weight increases by the weight of water

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.270
it displaces.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.899
So obviously this beaker is going to end up
being heavier.

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.549
Now I want to propose an additional experiment.

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.749
What if instead of tethering the ping pong
ball to the base of this beaker, I just got

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:36.869
a free ping pong ball and submerged it with
my finger, just barely under the surface of

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:37.870
the water?

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.009
In that case, what do you think would happen
when the scale was allowed to rotate?

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.450
Would it tilt down A) towards the hanging
acrylic ball or B)

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.920
down towards the ping pong ball, which is
now just barely submerged under the water

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:58.859
or C) would the balance remain perfectly balanced?So
I want you to make your selection, make your

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:04.570
prediction by leaving a comment starting with
either A, B or C and then giving me your explanation.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.510
And I will tally up the votes and let you
know the answer next time.
