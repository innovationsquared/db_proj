00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860
Part of this video was sponsored by LastPass. Stick around to the end for a word from our sponsor.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.900
In a recent study participants were placed in a room for between 6 and 15 minutes.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.500
They were given nothing except a button that they knew would shock them if they pressed it.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.180
They were asked to entertain themselves with their thoughts,

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.200
but they could self administer the shock if they so chose.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.080
So what happened?

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.320
Well, 25% of women and 67% of men shocked themselves.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.280
This is despite the fact that they had previously told the experimenters

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.940
that they would pay money to avoid the shock.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.580
Apparently they'd rather experience physical pain than just be bored;

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.020
to have nothing to keep them occupied but their thoughts.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.320
But they are not alone.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.020
Around 95% of American adults report participating in some leisure activities over the past 24 hours.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.500
But only 17% say they spent any time at all just relaxing and thinking,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.720
because that apparently is boring, and being bored is unpleasant.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.840
So what is boredom? Well contrary to popular belief, it's not when you have absolutely nothing to do.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.120
It's just when none of the options you have available to you appeal to you.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.820
Boredom is characterized by a lack of concentration, restlessness, but also feeling lethargic.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.860
It's really a state of being underwhelmed.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.060
And there are now more ways than ever to avoid boredom.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.700
With Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.960
not to mention my chronic news I have waiting in line, sitting in a coffee shop, stopped at a traffic light.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.600
Many people reach for their phones to stave off boredom, and nowhere is sacred.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.540
Do you ever just let yourself be bored?

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.500
No, no, I generally don't.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.700
But are we losing anything by avoiding boredom?

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.440
Well, scientific research says yes, and what we're losing is important.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.240
When you're bored your mind wanders.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.500
That's only natural.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.960
The state of boredom is one where your attention is not focused on anything in particular.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.060
Researchers have shown this mind wandering is useful for creativity.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.580
They gave study participants a random boring task. The most boring one: reading the phone book.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.700
Then, they asked participants to be creative;

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.180
generate as many ideas as they could for what you could do with a plastic cup.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.360
Those in the most boring read the phone book condition

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.060
generated the most creative solutions compared to less bored controls.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.880
A major reason many researchers suspect that we experience boredom

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.940
is because it gives you an indicator of your current state.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.100
I mean, if you find yourself feeling bored, you know something about that situation isn't working for you.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.760
Let me ask you this. When you're in class and you're a bit bored

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.880
do you ever just pull out your phone and have a look at stuff?

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.580
Yeah. All the time.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:12.300
So the paradox of boredom is that it makes you feel tired, sluggish and just disinterested.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.760
But it may actually spur you to action. It may get you to make changes that would be positive for your life.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.760
And changes like getting this guy's legs out of my face. That would be perfect.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.900
In the absence of boredom, one would remain trapped in unfulfilling situations

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.140
and miss out on many emotionally, cognitively and socially rewarding experiences.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.980
Boredom is both a warning that we're not doing what we want to be doing,

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.920
and a push that motivates us to switch goals and projects.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.240
Studies have also shown that boredom may make you more altruistic.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.060
Perhaps the acute sense of aimlessness you experience when you're bored gets out of control,

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.240
and makes you question what you're doing with your life as a whole.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.400
But the silver lining is that it may trigger you to think about others and what you can do to help them.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.560
And that provides an immediate and concrete purpose to a life that might momentarily feel like it's lacking one.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.520
You know, studies designed to induce boredom have shown

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.220
that more bored participants are more likely to donate to charity, or to give blood.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.120
Can I ask what led you to donate blood today?

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.980
I had free time in my hands. You know, just, waiting for 2 hours, an hour and a half or so.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.260
So apparently the opportunity to do meaningful,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.560
even if unpleasant activities have more value if you're bored than if you're not.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.420
Similarly, this aimless state seems to cultivate thoughts about what you want to do with your life.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.920
To think of your life as a story and consider where you want it to go in the future.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.780
This is called autobiographical planning.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.140
When given tasks that only use a fraction of mental capacity,

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.340
study participants frequently thought of the future and their plans for it.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.820
In this way being bored is essential for goal-setting.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.600
If your brain is always consumed with other stimuli,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.900
you'll rarely ponder the bigger picture and set long-term goals for yourself and consider how to achieve them.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.780
Does a phone get rid of your boredom?

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.640
Yeah, actually, thinking about it, it does.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.960
So every time you're waiting for something,

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.560
you have a decision to make which seems like a tiny one.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.260
Pull out your phone for a few seconds or minutes, or just be bored; experience only your thoughts.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.860
It seems like an insignificant decision.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.940
And if you don't give it much thought the obvious action is to see what's new on your app of choice

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.200
And in making that decision you are alleviating a moment of boredom.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.040
But you are also likely making yourself less creative, less altruistic,

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.000
less likely to assess your current state and less likely to set goals for your future.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.460
In short, you are the real world example of someone shocking themselves

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.460
to avoid the unpleasantness of boredom.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:03.660
Except in your case, the pain goes much deeper to the very nature of who you are, and who you will become.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.000
So think carefully before pressing that button.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.380
So, being bored is apparently something our brains need to do.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.820
Something our brains don't need to do, is remember lots of random passwords.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.280
Which is why the sponsor of this video is LastPass.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.480
LastPass is a password manager

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:34.000
that offers unlimited password storage plus free sync across all your devices, and password breach alerts.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.100
That way you never have to remember another password or write it down,

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.700
look for one, forget your passwords, reset them.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:47.060
All of that hassle is just pushed aside and you can put your passwords on autopilot with LastPass.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.540
And that way you can free up your valuable brain space for

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.340
just being bored and thinking about your life rather than remembering your passwords.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:00.580
Now, LastPass has multi-factor authentication which is super important because it keeps your accounts secure.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.140
It also interfaces with Microsoft and Yubikey's multi-factor authentication.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.740
And one feature I love about LastPass is it allows you to share,

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:14.240
safely and securely, your passwords with other people who may need them for certain accounts.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.200
That's a very handy feature.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.180
