00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.970
Sometimes the simplest questions have the
most amazing answers.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.950
Like how can trees be so tall?
It's a question that doesn't even seem

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.730
like it needs an answer.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.330
Trees just are tall.
Some of them are over 100 meters.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.050
Why should there be a height limit?

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.800
I'll tell you why. Tress need to transport
water from their roots up into their topmost

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.570
branches in order to survive. And that is
no trivial task.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.140
There is a limit to the height that water
can be sucked up a tube - it's 10 meters.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.130
If you suck on a long vertical straw, the
water will go no higher than 10 meters. At

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.090
this point there will be a perfect vacuum
at the top of the straw and the water will

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.790
start to boil spontaneously. For a tree to
raise water 100 meters, it would have to create

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.600
a pressure difference of 10 atmospheres.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.640
How would trees do that?

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.180
When I posed this conundrum, a lot of people
said the answer is transpiration. And that's

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.900
when water evaporates from the leaf, pulling
up the water molecules behind it. Now that's

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.530
clearly a mechanism a tree can use to create
suction, but it doesn't help us overcome this

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.710
10 meter limit.
The lowest the pressure can go is a pure vacuum,

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.590
which I imagine is not happening inside of
tree leaves, right?

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.110
Right, Hank. So you might suspect that a tree
does not contain continuous straw-like tubes

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.860
The tree effectively has valves in it. So
you don't have a column of water

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.480
This big tube that you're saying needs to
be full of water is actually made up of cells.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.420
Although these are good speculations, they
don't turn out to be correct.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.030
Scientists who study trees find that the xylem
tubes that transport water do contain a continuous

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.620
water column. So how else could the tree transport
water from the roots to the leaves?

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.700
They don't suck, they don't use a vacuum.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.880
OK, so how do they do it?

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.170
Squeezing like a cow udder all the way up.
They have little tree muscles in there.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.190
Yeah.
Besides being a giant waste of energy, all

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.490
of the cells that make up the xylem tubes
are all dead.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.570
What about osmotic pressure? If there is more
solute in the roots than in the surrounding

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.350
soil, water would be pushed up the tree. But
some trees live in mangroves, where the water

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.840
is so salty that osmotic pressure actually
acts in the other direction so the tree needs

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.970
additional pressure to suck water into the
tree.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.120
Then it must be capillary action. The thinner
the tube, the higher the water can climb.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.420
But the tubes in a tree are too wide - at
20-200 micrometers in diameter, water should

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.310
rise less than a meter.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.630
So how do trees do it?

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.410
Well one of the assumptions we made is wrong:
The lowest the pressure can go is a pure vacuum

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.480
pure vacuum
pure vacuum

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.830
In a gas, this is true. When you eliminate
all of the gas molecules, the pressure is

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.690
zero and you have a perfect vacuum.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.220
But in a liquid, you can go lower than 0 pressure
and actually get negative pressures. In a

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.660
solid, we would think of this as tension.
This means that the molecules are pulling

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.300
on each other and their surroundings.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.040
As the water evaporates from the pores of
the cell wall, they create immense negative

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.220
pressures of -15 atmospheres in an average
tree. Think about the air-water interface

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.410
at the pore. There is one atmosphere of pressure
pushing in and negative 15 atmospheres of

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.770
suction on the other side. So why doesn't
the meniscus break? Because the pores are

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:18.770
tiny, only 2-5 nanometres in diameter. At
this scale, water's high surface tension ensures

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.260
the air-water boundary can withstand huge
pressures without caving.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.370
As you move down the tree, the pressure increases,
up to atmospheric at the roots. So you can

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.030
have a large pressure difference between the
top and bottom of the tree because the pressure

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.300
at the top is so negative.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.360
But hang on, if the pressure near the top
is negative 15 atmospheres, shouldn't the

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.050
water be boiling?

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.599
Yes. Yes it should.

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.260
But changing phase from liquid to gas requires
activation energy. And that can come in the

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.110
form of a nucleation site like a tiny air
bubble. That's why it's so important that

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.260
the xylem tubes contain no air bubbles, and
they can do this because unlike a straw, they

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.930
have been water-filled from the start. This
way, water remains in the metastable liquid

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.360
state when it really should be boiling.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.370
It's just like supercooled water remains liquid
when it really should be ice. So you could

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.340
say that the water in a tree is supersucked
because it remains liquid at such negative

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.920
pressures.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.459
And why are trees moving all this water up
the tree? I want you to make a guess, say

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.309
it out loud.
For photosynthesis?

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:27.080
Actually, no. Less than 1% of the water is
used in photosynthetic reactions. Any other

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.939
ideas?
Ok what about growth? Well 5% of the water

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:34.770
is used to make new cells.
Well, so then what happens to the other 95%

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.499
of the water?
It just evaporates.

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:43.009
For each molecule of carbon dioxide a tree
takes in, it loses hundreds of water molecules

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:43.839
of water.

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:44.569
Woah.

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:49.460
Can you believe how amazing this is? Trees
create huge negative pressures of 10's of

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.860
atmospheres, by evaporating water through
nanoscale pores, sucking water up 100m, in

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.659
a state where it should be boiling but can't
because of the perfect xylem tubes contain

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:03.300
no air bubbles, just so that most of it can
evaporate in the process of absorbing a couple

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.979
molecules of carbon dioxide.

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:13.979
I will never look at a tree the same way again.

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:24.339
I'd like to say a huge thank you to Hank,
Henry and Professor Poliakoff for making on

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:29.270
camera hypotheses. This is an essential part
of the scientific process even if your hypothesis

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.930
turns out to be wrong.
As Einstein said, "a person who has never

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.889
made a mistake has never tried anything new."
I've always wondered what it would be like

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.210
to be on this side of a Veritasium video.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.770
Now I'd be surprised if you weren't already
subscribed to these guys, but if you're not,

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.729
go click on these annotations and check out
their channels. You may just learn something.

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.309
I'd also like to thank Professor John Sperry
from the University of Utah. He walked me

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:56.150
through all of this in an hour-long Skype
conversation so I'm going to put a link to

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.960
his website in the description.
We're looking at pressures here below atmospheric,

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.460
is that right?
That's right. Below atmospheric. This is liquid

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:09.919
pressure not gas pressure. So it's a common
misconception that oh, you can't have you

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:14.050
know negative pressures because there's no
molecules left. You know, the definition of

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:20.399
pure vacuum is zero molecules. That's for
a gas, ok. So just to be clear...

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:23.619
I think this was one of my big problems in
understanding this.

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:27.339
This video would have been impossible without
CGP Grey. When I told him in London about

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:32.379
this idea in London...
And I felt like 'pssshhh mind just blown with

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:34.479
this whole thing'
He said it was going to be really hard to

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:38.939
explain and when he says it's hard to explain
you know things are going to be tough. So

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:41.399
thank you for all your input to this script.

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:45.939
And thank you for watching. Making this video
has been a real odyssey for me so thank you

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:50.110
for joining me on this journey. I really appreciate
all of your comments and if you haven't subscribed

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.710
to the channel already you can click the annotation
or click the link above and join me on my

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.619
next scientific adventure.

00:06:56.619 --> 00:07:03.619
I made a video promising to make a video about
the answer to this. I proposed the problem

00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:07.849
like a couple months ago, and I was like "subscribe
to the channel and I'll give you the answer

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:14.249
next week." Hahaha
Oh, the lies.

00:07:14.249 --> 00:07:17.149
Drive it at the right frequency.
Oh

00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:21.240
Yes!!
Success is frightening.
