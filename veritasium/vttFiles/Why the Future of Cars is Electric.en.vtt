00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.840
I was invited here, to Munich, by BMW the sponsor of this video

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.200
to find out why the future of cars is electric.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.880
But electric cars are actually nothing new -- they date back to 1832,

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.160
well before the first gasoline-powered car.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.960
In fact, the first car to go faster than a hundred kilometers per hour

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.080
was in 1899, an electric one,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.320
called the Jamais Contente, meaning "never satisfied".

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.640
But people were apparently satisfied with electric cars.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.240
By 1910, they were almost twice as common on American roads as internal combustion engines.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:45.200
But then came the Model T, which at $650 was significantly cheaper than comparable electric cars

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.080
and as gas stations popped up around the country, they could be quickly refueled,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:57.040
allowing you to travel farther, faster, and cheaper than electric cars, which took a long time to recharge.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.480
So by 1935, the electric vehicle had been commercially obliterated.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.400
But electric cars were still useful for some things:

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.120
in the vacuum of space, an electric vehicle was the obvious choice for the Apollo lunar roving vehicle.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:19.080
It was a single-use vehicle due to its non rechargeable silver zinc potassium hydroxide battery,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.560
and it had a range of just 92 kilometers.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.920
But the astronauts never needed even half of this range.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.920
At the Munich Olympics in 1972, to lead marathon runners in their race,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.760
BMW created an electric version of its two series car.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:43.840
The car ran on 12 large car batteries for a maximum range of 60 kilometers, or 37 miles.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.880
This demonstrated the benefits of electric vehicles: they can run quietly with no emissions.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.880
But it also illustrated their limitations: with the battery technology available at the time,

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.200
electric cars were expensive and short-range, impractical for everyday use.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.840
So why are electric cars the future?

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.280
In 2020, BMW is launching the IX3 all-electric sport utility vehicle,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.200
and they plan to have 25 electrified vehicles in their fleet by 2023.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.960
A lot of their concept cars, like the Vision M Next, are electric vehicles

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.280
and they have a Formula-E car which can now run a whole race on a single battery pack.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.040
This is all made possible by developments in battery technology.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.520
Batteries have gotten a lot better,

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.720
particularly with the introduction of lithium ion batteries.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.960
First used in mobile phones about 30 years ago,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.200
lithium ion batteries have almost two times more energy in the same volume

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.560
than the next-best battery chemistry.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.360
Because of their use in many consumer products like phones and laptops,

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.320
their manufacturing costs continue to decline,

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.720
driven by manufacturing and supply chain optimization.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.760
Over the last three decades, the energy density has increased both per unit mass and per unit volume,

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.840
while the price has plummeted.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.440
This is unlike internal combustion engines which, after a century of development,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.880
have few areas left for improvement.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.200
And the reality is, you don't really travel that far in a car.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.720
The batteries available today are good enough for all but the longest road trips.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.120
In the US, 99% of trips are under 160 kilometers, or 100 miles.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.840
And electric cars are just better vehicles.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.040
Here are my top 10 reasons why:

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.680
First: more torque from a standstill.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.640
2. Thanks to the batteries under the floor, they have a low center of mass and so better handling.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.720
3. Since you can drive electric motors independently,

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.760
you can have precise control over each wheel for maximum traction.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.840
4. Electric cars are quieter.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.680
5. Electric cars are cheaper to run than gas cars,

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.160
because gas is more expensive than electricity for the same distance traveled.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.360
6. Electric cars are more efficient than gas cars,

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.840
both in converting stored energy into energy of motion and in regenerating some of that energy when braking.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.760
7. You never have to visit a gas station, because you can recharge at home.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.200
8. There's less maintenance: fewer moving parts, no oil changes,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.720
and the brakes wear out less often thanks to regenerative braking.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.520
9. And depending on the source of electricity, in my case, solar panels,

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.760
electric cars don't produce any CO2 at all, so they don't contribute to climate change.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.320
Plus, as cars become essentially computers on wheels,

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.000
electric vehicles are leading the way towards self-driving cars.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.040
Alright we're gonna start our ride in an autonomous vehicle, my first time ever:

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.960
Level 4 autonomy.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.320
Once this becomes commonplace, it's likely we'll change how we see cars:

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.440
from something we own that sits idle for most of its existence,

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.760
to transportation as a service,

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.600
something we ride in to get from point A to point B,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.760
and something we share with others.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.040
There are still a lot of details to work out,

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.560
but it's clear to me that the future of cars is electric, autonomous, and shared.
