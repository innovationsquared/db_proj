00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.010
Derek: A couple of years ago my friend Destin

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.020
and I wanted to definitively answer the

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.029
question: does water actually swirl the

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.859
opposite direction down the drain in the

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.570
other hemisphere? At the time, I was

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.580
living in Sydney, Australia, and Destin

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.440
was in Huntsville, Alabama. Those are

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.210
about the same latitude, just opposite

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.730
sides of the Equator, so we created two

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.050
videos that were meant to be watched

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.550
simultaneously, and if you want to

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.350
synchronize them yourself, you can click

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.090
the link in the description, but we also

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.680
recognize that that was a hassle for

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.390
some people, particularly watching on

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.460
mobile devices, and that's why I'm now

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.189
releasing this extra wide video of both

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.579
videos synchronized. The Simpsons did a

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.739
whole episode based on toilet flushing

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.079
the opposite direction in Australia. Plus,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.390
other shows have supposedly demonstrated

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.560
this effect.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.210
Destin: So I have seen documentaries

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.500
that seemed to indicate that which

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.149
hemisphere you're in determines which

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.680
way the water is going to swirl, but

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.270
there's this other group of people, and

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.920
they seem really confident that it

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.320
doesn't matter where you're at, the

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.000
water's going to swirl however it wants.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.180
Derek: so is this a real effect or not?

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.539
Hank: the application of this principle to

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.910
draining water in Earth's two hemispheres

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.820
is just bunk.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.640
Destin: But if you ever just look

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.990
for yourself and figured out which way your

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.680
toilets swirls,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.720
Derek: if you try it yourself

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.799
you'll find inconsistent results.

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.299
Destin: Here in Alabama I've noticed that some turn

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.160
counterclockwise and some go clockwise

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.980
Derek: this sink sometimes drains one way and

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.220
sometimes the other way.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.320
Destin: You see, most will it have little jets in it, so the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.700
swirl direction is determined by the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.420
design of the toilet and not which

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.740
hemisphere you're in.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.780
Derek: In any container of

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.110
water there's always going to be some

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.060
rotation: the water is not perfectly

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.549
still, and it is this, rather than the

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.320
hemisphere, that determines which way the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.600
water will swirl down the drain.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.240
Derek: so it's a myth: crossing the equator does not

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.560
mean the toilet's going to change

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.570
directions. But what if we come into the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.740
garage and do a more controlled

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.800
experiment?

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.680
Derek: But what if we could

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.210
eliminate all motion from the water?

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.430
Destin: This is a one and a half meter kiddie pool.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.880
Derek: I have here a five foot wide kiddie pool.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.760
Destin: Instead of filling the pool with no vorticity at

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.479
all, I'm going against the way it's

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.700
supposed to drain.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.790
So I'm trying to fill

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.680
it with a flow going clockwise.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.980
Derek: I actually fill the pool in the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.330
anti-clockwise direction to be sure that

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.700
any clockwise motion we see is no

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.880
due to the way I filled the pool.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.420
Destin: So let's let the water settle for a complete day

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.250
so that we know that it's perfectly still.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.280
Derek: I've left this water sitting here for 24

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.650
hours. So it seems like I damped all of

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.860
the motions from the filling.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.660
Destin: I'm not going to reach in and pull a plug out

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.800
because that would induce some vorticity.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.420
I'm going to use this valve that I have

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.160
connected to the bottom of the pool.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.520
Derek: I really hope this works. Destin, wish me luck.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.780
Destin: Good luck Derek.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.660
Derek: I'm about to pull

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.320
the plug.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.820
Destin: okay opening the valve in

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.480
Both: three, two, one

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.940
Destin: Water should be flowing

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.280
Derek: And the pool is draining. But you can't see any

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.160
motion of the water just yet.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.920
been flowing for a couple of minutes and I

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.489
haven't seen anything yet, so we're going to

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.940
put some dye in it.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Derek: To help us see where the water is blowing I'm going to put

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.920
some food coloring in on the four

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:09.120
cardinal directions around the pool.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.680
Destin: Check it out, it's like a tornado like right off

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.020
the bat.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.720
We got a counterclockwise rotation.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.140
We filled it up clockwise, and now

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.800
it's going counterclockwise.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.200
Derek: You can clearly see that the water is

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.910
flowing clockwise, in this direction, and

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.260
that makes sense because that's how it

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.040
should flow in the southern hemisphere

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.920
due to the Earth's rotation.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.680
Destin: We have a kiddie pool in my garage, and the whole

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.980
Earth is rotating and the water's going

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.720
counterclockwise because I'm in the

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.240
northern hemisphere. It's real! This is real!

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.819
Derek: But you can see what a tiny little

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.560
effect it is and what extraordinary

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.049
lengths I had to go to to see this

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.910
effect. So really, you're not going to see

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.170
it in the bathtub and you're not going

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.549
to see it in a sink or in a toilet

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.290
because there are other sources of

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.520
angular Momentum that totally wash out this effect.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.880
Destin: we just proved it because we

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.920
just eliminated variables.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.380
Destin: The Coriolis Effect is real.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.360
Derek: The Coriolis Effect, There you have it. It works!

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.760
To understand how it works, imagine a pool

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.980
with one edge touching the South Pole.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.440
Destin: Think about a pool near the North Pole.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.180
Derek: the pool is stationary relative to Earth,

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.620
but every day it's actually completing one full revolution.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.440
Destin: the Earth is spinning on its axis, so the pool spins around the

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.080
pole once a day.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.060
Derek: Now you can see the side

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.560
of the pool furthest from the pole

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.450
travels much farther every day than the

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.340
side right next to the pole.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.340
Destin: the pool is moving but the part that's

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.120
closest to the Equator has more momentum,

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.080
and the part that's closest to the pole has less.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.400
Derek: So the outer side of the pool is

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.770
moving fastest towards the east and as

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.600
you get closer to the pole the velocity

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.440
decreases down to zero.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.200
Destin: Think about these velocities relative to the drain in the middle.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.580
Derek: Now, imagine we drain the pool

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.320
Destin: When we pull the plug, all the water

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.560
starts moving towards the middle.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.720
Derek: Water from the far side is moving too fast

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.310
relative to the drain, and so it gets out

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.470
ahead, whereas water from near the pole

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.580
is going too slow, and so it lags behind.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.539
Destin: The side nearest the equator is going

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.760
faster, so that water outruns the drain,

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.460
but the water nearest the pole is going

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.840
slower, so it falls behind.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.380
Both: So when the water approaches the drain it swirls

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.780
(counter)clockwise.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.470
Destin: this is the reason

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.150
hurricanes swirl counterclockwise in

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.660
the northern hemisphere,

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.240
Derek: And this is the

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.340
reason cyclones swirl clockwise in the

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:23.869
southern hemisphere.

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:24.780
Destin: The center of the

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.550
hurricane has lower pressure, just like a

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.180
drain, so the hurricane swirls just like our pool.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.900
Derek: The higher pressure air rushes into

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.550
the eye of the storm, and just like in

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.170
our pool, swirls in the direction

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.620
dictated by the hemisphere.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.220
Both: And that's the truth about toilet swirls.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.060
[End of Sync]

you enjoyed that, and thanks for watching.
