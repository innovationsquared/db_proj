00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:06.460
Have you ever made ice cubes and then found
that when you take them out of the freezer

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.740
there are spikes on them?

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.230
This phenomenon has caused a lot of curiosity
and some concern.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.330
The truth is, there is a simple physical process
responsible for ice cube spikes.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.830
Ice cubs cool first from their top surface
where they are in direct contact with the

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.300
cold freezer air and from which evaporative
cooling can occur.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.689
So the first ice crystals form on the surface
of the ice cube and along its edges.

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.200
Now as that ice freezes, it expands by roughly
eight percent.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.660
That is due to hydrogen bonding between the
water molecules which makes them on average

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.640
slightly further apart than they are in water.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.300
So as the ice grows in from all sides, the
water in the middle has nowhere to go.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.400
And it is forced up and out through a hole
in the ice.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.750
These holes are often triangular in shape
because ice crystals tend to meet at 60 degree

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.750
angles.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.620
As the water comes up through the hole it
freezes around the edges forming a hollow

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.620
spike.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.920
And as the ice continues to grow, more water
is forced up the spike, making it longer.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.080
This continues until all of the water is frozen,
or until the end of the spike freezes shut.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.180
If you want to make ice cube spikes, they
can be created in most ordinary freezers and

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.920
there are three steps you can take to increase
your chances.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.750
Number one, the ideal temperature seems to
be not too cold, between minus five and minus

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.750
eight Celsius.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.540
That is cold enough to freeze the water, but
not so quickly as to freeze off the tip of

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.710
that ice cube spike.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.740
Number two, distilled water seems to work
better than tap water because even small concentrations

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.770
of salt prevent spike formation.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.049
Number three, a fan in the freezer seems to
help spike formation by increasing the circulation

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.870
of the air and increasing evaporative cooling.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.810
And given just the right conditions, very
large ice spikes can form, for example, on

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.020
bird baths.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.619
In these cases the spikes are known as ice
vases, for obvious reasons.

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.840
When looking at this structures, it is interesting
to contemplate that they only form because

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.659
of water’s unique property of expanding
when it freezes.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.569
If water didn’t expand when it froze, the
whole earth would be dramatically different,

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.209
because, well, since ice is less dense, it
forms on the surface and actually insulates

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.290
the water underneath, so it remains liquid
and allows life to survive in it.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.090
But if, instead, ice were denser than water,
it would sink to the bottom allowing for further

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.430
cooling of that water and more ice formation.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.660
And the ice would build up from the bottom
upwards, giving less and less water for organisms

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.269
to live in, until, if cold conditions persisted
for long enough, all bodies of water would

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.840
completely solidify as ice, meaning that virtually
no life could live in them.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.930
And at that point, the earth would also be
completely white.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.889
So it would reflect more of the sun’s light
into space, leading to further cooling.

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:02.340
So if water didn’t expand when it froze,
the whole earth would be a cold, lifeless

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.709
snowball.

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.819
But it all depends on your starting conditions,
because if there wasn’t very much ice on

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.319
the earth to begin with, it would all sink
to the bottom of bodies of water, including

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.269
arctic sea ice and that means the earth’s
surface would be less reflective, so it would

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.980
absorb more heat from the sun and it would
get a lot warmer.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.409
So if ice didn’t float, if ice was denser
than water, either the earth would be much

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:35.099
colder than it is now or much hotter than
it is now.

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.469
And in either case, life on earth might not
exist.

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:53.319
But if it did, we wouldn’t be able to make
ice cube spikes.
