00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
At the Palace of discovery in Paris, they

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.839
have this huge turntable where you can

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.150
sit, and perform experiments. Like in the

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.130
middle of the turntable you can put some

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.230
water and then add liquid nitrogen, and

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.509
this creates a kind of fog these tiny

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.850
water droplets that spread out from the

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.830
middle, but because the actual linear

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.350
speed of this turntable is increasing

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.019
the further out you go well, the vapor

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.609
falls further and further behind

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.490
creating a swirl, that looks a little bit

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.859
like a Hurricane. And that analogy is not

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.380
by accident, the Earth is after all one

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.410
giant turntable, and the weather patterns

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.899
we get are a result of that. When you

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.030
study Physics in rotating frames of

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.250
reference, or even just rotating bodies.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.649
You find some pretty mysterious and

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.870
counterintuitive phenomena, which is why

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.879
I'm dedicating this video to four

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.050
revolutionary riddles. Number one here I

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.329
have a ramp, or an inclined plane and

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.620
just to show you i'm not doing anything

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.890
funny with it, if I just let a roll of

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.080
tape go it will accelerate down the ramp.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.220
But! Here I have a mystery cylinder, and

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.490
I'm going to place that on the ramp, and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.400
we will see that it rolls, and then it

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.340
stops, and then rolls, and then stops. So my

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.580
question to you is. What is In the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.980
mystery cylinder? What is this object?

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.300
Number two, take a bicycle and have

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.020
someone support it, so it doesn't fall

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.579
over or lean it up against something, and

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.460
then take a bit of string and tie it to

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.770
the bottom pedal. Now what I'm going to

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.070
do is pull backwards horizontally on

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.320
this string, and I want you to predict

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.689
what the bike will do. Will it go

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.439
backwards? Forwards? Or will it just stay

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.229
there and not move. My intuition would

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.469
tell me that it would go forward? I think it

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.490
might not move if you're going to be

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.140
pulling backwards from a stationary

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.990
point on the pedal, you're going to be

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.050
pulling it backwards just as the pedals are tying to

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.120
spin the wheels forward, so maybe

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.590
it might not move. Things gonna go

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.270
forward, I'll go forward. Sure? Yeah, I'm

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.020
sure. all right three, two, one.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.380
Number three. I want you to think about running two laps of

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.630
this track now the first lap you can go

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.610
as slowly as you like, let's call that

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.030
speed V1. But on your second lap, I want

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.400
you to run faster. Such that the total

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.430
average speed for both laps combined is

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.240
twice V1, twice the speed of your first

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.430
lap so the question for you is. How fast

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.470
do you have to run that second lap, so that

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.100
your total average speed, is two V1?

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.900
Number four, any time a train is moving, either

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.470
slowly or very fast. There is a part of

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.210
the train which is actually moving

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.550
backwards with respect to the ground,

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.770
that is not backwards with respect to

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.870
the train, and it doesn't have to be

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.340
going so slowly that if you ran

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.050
backwards you would be going backwards

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.240
with respect to the ground. It is at any

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.200
speed, any normal train will have a part

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.300
of it, which is moving backwards with

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.820
respect to the ground. My question to you

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.770
is. Which part is it? now with these four

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.260
riddles, you can make me a video response

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.970
if you like to tell me about your

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.100
solutions to them. Or you can simply

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.350
leave your answers in the comments below

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.450
and number them 1 2 3 4 so we know which

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.910
ones you're talking about, and I will

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.860
post all of the answers up and next week

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.900
at the same time same place.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.620
All of my videos are made possible by my Patrons

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.480
on Patreon, so if you are one of those

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.520
people. Thank you so much for your

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.250
ongoing support, and if you're not. Maybe

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.810
now is a good time to consider becoming

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.860
one, if you go to Patreon.com/Veritasium

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.820
you can support me there.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.720
Otherwise, if you're interested in more

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.360
riddle-y puzzling things, you can check out

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.380
my Spinning tube trick, my 5 fun physics

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.630
phenomena, and say the spinning district

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.310
and if you haven't subscribed Veritasium

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.810
already I highly recommend you do that.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.239
And since i'll be posting the answers

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.750
next week I would like for you to ring

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.520
the bell down below, and that will make

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.560
sure that you're notified

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.930
when my videos come out. So as always,

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.930
thanks for watching wait that's, that's

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.350
Michael's line.
