00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
- Ever since the invention
of nuclear weapons,

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.340
humanity has almost
accidentally destroyed itself

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.870
many times over.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.269
This is a video about
just some of those times.

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:11.250
(rocket whooshing)

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.690
It's about nuclear bombs

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.823
and missiles accidentally detonating.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.663
It's about hydrogen bombs being lost.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.710
And it's about false
alarms that could have led

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.620
to the end of the world.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.990
(bomb rumbling)

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.870
On the 17th of January, 1966,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.160
a B-52 bomber was flying
over the coast of Spain.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.250
It was carrying four hydrogen bombs,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.220
each one 75 times more powerful

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.173
than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.100
This sounds crazy, but in the mid 1960s,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.720
during the height of the Cold War,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.910
this was routine.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.840
This was part of a military
operation known as Chrome Dome

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.300
where bombers flew
around the United States

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.760
and skirted the borders
of the Soviet Union

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.280
with hydrogen bombs on board.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.120
The thinking was that if the
USSR initiated a first strike,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.010
the US could rapidly retaliate

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.590
by having bombers already up in the air

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.960
and closer to their targets.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.090
The flight took off from North Carolina

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.010
and crossed the Atlantic Ocean

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.770
with the plan to fly by the
border of the Soviet Union

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.660
and return home.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.260
The plane would be in the
air for more than 24 hours.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.060
The flight was so long, it
required two mid-air refuelings.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.080
But long flights and mid-air
refuelings were commonplace.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.840
Flights like this happened every day.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.660
The first refuelling went smoothly.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.330
After flying by the Soviet
Union and turning around,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.820
the plane needed to be refuelled again.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.430
So at 10:30 a.m., over the coast of Spain,

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.490
above the small fishing
village of Palomares,

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.360
the refuelling tanker pulled
up in front of the B-52.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.210
Larry Messinger, the pilot
of the bomber, recalled.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.980
- [Larry] We came up behind the tanker

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.713
and we were going a little bit too fast.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.570
There's a procedure they
have where the boom operator,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.673
if you get in a dangerous position,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.870
he calls, "Break away,
break away, break away,"

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.020
and you immediately cut the
throttles and drop down below.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.660
Well, there was no such call.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.960
We were dropping down below the tanker

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.720
and all of a sudden something happened.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.240
There was an explosion of some kind.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.130
- The two planes collided.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.860
The boom arm, which held
the refuelling nozzle,

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.730
hit the B-52, breaking off its left wing.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.740
The resulting explosion was big enough

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.260
that it was witnessed by another B-52

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.140
which was flying a
kilometre and a half away.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.510
All four men on the refuelling tanker

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.030
and three of the seven on the B-52

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.683
were killed in the accident.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.373
The four bombs fell to earth.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.980
Each one of them had a yield
of 1.1 megatons of TNT,

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.500
about 75 times more powerful

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.483
than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.290
A hydrogen bomb gets most of its power

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.780
from the fusion of tritium and deuterium,

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.570
which are isotopes of
hydrogen with extra neutrons.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.880
When these isotopes fuse into helium,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.600
a little bit of mass is lost,
which is released as energy.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.700
But it takes a tremendous amount of energy

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.770
to get that reaction started,

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.580
which is why a hydrogen bomb
is actually three bombs in one.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.570
A conventional bomb

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.020
which when detonated triggers
the plutonium fission bomb

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.540
which then creates high enough
temperatures and pressures

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.850
and releases enough energetic X-rays

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.340
to trigger the fusion reaction.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.610
The conventional explosives
in two of the four bombs

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.680
detonated on impact.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.530
Fortunately, to trigger
the fission reaction,

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.053
the explosion needs to be symmetrical.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.600
But since the conventional explosives

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.370
detonated on impact with the ground,

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.470
the shockwave wasn't symmetrical

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.563
and so the fission and
fusion bombs weren't set off.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.640
Unfortunately, the conventional explosive

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.200
blew up the plutonium core,

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.410
contaminating a 2.6-square-kilometer area

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.670
of the Spanish coastline

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.653
with radioactive material.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.760
The area is still contaminated
with radioactive atoms

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.693
to this day.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.710
- [Reporter] But after the
crash the villagers were told

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.630
to eat no locally produced food

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.210
and there was an embargo
on it in nearby markets.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.140
- The third bomb was found
intact in a nearby riverbed.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.660
But the fourth bomb was missing.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.797
- [Reporter] Somewhere out there

00:04:31.797 --> 00:04:33.720
off the sunny coast of southern Spain

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.040
and H bomb is missing.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.680
It's been missing now
for over three weeks.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.540
- Mr. Ambassador, how was
your swim this morning?

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.490
Did you by any chance
stub your toe on the bomb

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.540
while you were out there today?

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.500
- Wish I had.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.740
- 29 US Army ships were
involved in the search,

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.990
and it still took 81 days

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.960
for the bomb to finally
be located and recovered.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.820
I wanna say this again.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.270
There was a hydrogen bomb that
was 75 times more powerful

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.070
than the one dropped on Hiroshima,

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.490
and it was missing for
nearly three months.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.650
This is not an isolated incident.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.200
It's common enough that
the US military has a term

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.510
for accidents involving nuclear weapons.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.220
- [Reporter] The D-Day
clock thus begun ticking

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.930
with a potential Broken Arrow message

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.640
from Nellis Air Force Base.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.590
- They call them Broken Arrows.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.710
The Pentagon officially
lists 32 such accidents

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.810
between 1950 and 1980.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.690
Five of them occurred during
operation Chrome Dome,

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.980
cases when a B-52 carrying
hydrogen bombs crashed.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.820
In 1961, the first year
of operation Chrome Dome,

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.200
a B-52 had a fuel leak and it
crashed over North Carolina.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.020
Three members of the crew
died in the accident.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.413
It was carrying two 4-megaton bombs.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.890
Both bombs fell to earth.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.780
One had its parachute deploy

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.330
and it landed on the ground mostly intact.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.770
The other slammed into a
field and broke into pieces.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.230
The good news is that the
conventional explosives

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.370
did not explode,

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.710
so radioactive plutonium was not strewn

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.150
all over North Carolina.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.410
The bad news

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.900
is that the conventional
explosives didn't explode,

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.400
and so there was a chance

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.520
that the hydrogen bombs could
be armed and ready to detonate

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.930
with full force.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.300
Recalling the incident 52 years later,

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.650
Lieutenant Jack ReVelle,

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.680
who was responsible for the
safe disposal of the bomb, said.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.420
- [Jack] And as we started digging down,

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.400
trying to find the second bomb,

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.027
one of my sergeants says,

00:06:25.027 --> 00:06:28.710
"Hey, Lieutenant, I found
the arm safe switch."

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.330
And I said, "Great."

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.370
He says, "No, not great.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.080
It's on arm."

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.570
- At the time, a spokesman
for the Department of Defence

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.190
said that the bombs were unarmed

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.770
and could not have accidentally exploded.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.710
But in a report declassified in 2013,

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.680
it was stated that the bomb was armed.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.013
A single switch could have
triggered the detonation.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.480
By the way, the bomb is still there,

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.703
lodged about 50 metres under the field.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.460
After the bomb fell on the field,

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.750
there was a flash flood,

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.150
which meant that it couldn't be recovered.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.520
So to make sure that no
one could dig up the bomb,

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.410
the US military placed a 120-meter
diameter slab of concrete

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.150
over the whole area.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.710
According to the Pentagon report,

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.580
there is no detectable radiation
and no hazard in the area,

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.573
but a portion of one weapon
containing uranium is missing.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.860
There are dozens more events like this,

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.430
like the plane crash
over Greenland in 1968.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.380
The four hydrogen bombs it was carrying

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.180
burned up in the fire.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.130
The decontamination of
the surrounding area

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.423
took four months.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.740
That same year, the Soviet K-129 submarine

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.240
sank in the Pacific Ocean,

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.060
killing all 98 of its crew.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.300
It was also carrying
three nuclear warheads.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.633
Part of the submarine was
covertly recovered by the CIA.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.950
Another standout incident
occurred in 1965,

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:59.430
about 100 kilometres
off the coast of Japan.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:03.060
A Douglas A-4 jet carrying
at least one hydrogen bomb

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.630
fell off the aircraft carrier
during a training exercise.

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:10.800
The plane, the bomb, and the
pilot were never recovered.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.750
So, for more than half a century,

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.690
there has been a 1-megaton hydrogen bomb

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.430
laying on the sea floor

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.223
four kilometres below
the surface of the ocean.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.570
It is one of at least
six US nuclear weapons

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:27.600
that have been lost and never recovered.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.820
In 1998, Alexander Lebed,

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.340
Russia's former Chief
of National Security,

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.830
asserted that there are more than 100

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.930
1-kiloton nuclear bombs

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:38.343
that are unaccounted for.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.760
The most well-known Broken Arrow event

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.490
happened in September 1980.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.370
Inside a silo in rural Arkansas,

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.290
a team was conducting routine checks

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.380
on the Titan II intercontinental
ballistic missile.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.820
The missile was fueled,

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.100
ready to launch at a moment's notice.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.643
In its nose cone sat a
9-megaton hydrogen bomb.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.470
As one of the repairmen was
walking around the silo,

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.707
the socket from his
ratchet wrench fell off.

00:09:07.707 --> 00:09:10.374
(ominous music)

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.180
It fell 24 metres,

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.513
hitting the fuel tank of the
missile and puncturing a hole.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.200
The highly flammable rocket fuel

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.870
began to leak into the silo.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:28.140
The missile complex and
surrounding area were evacuated,

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.900
but a number of military
personnel remained on site

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.360
to try to diffuse the situation.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.220
- The maintenance team

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.290
had an indication of an engine fire

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:42.290
and a rise in vapour
concentration inside the silo.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.680
- At 3:00 a.m.,

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.070
about 8 1/2 hours after the
puncture of the fuel tank,

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:50.643
the leaking fuel vapours ignited,
resulting in an explosion.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.890
This explosion led to one
death and 21 injuries.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.430
The 740-ton door keeping the silo sealed

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.580
flew more than 60 metres into the air.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.120
It was recovered 200 metres away.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.010
The warhead containing the hydrogen bomb

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.900
was also blown out of the silo,

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.330
landing some 30 metres away.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.523
Luckily, it did not detonate.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.480
And these are just the near
misses that we know about.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.840
Of the 32 Broken Arrow events
listed by the Pentagon,

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.370
one which occurred in the spring
of 1968 remains classified.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:29.610
And there are likely many
dozens more nuclear mistakes

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.180
and near misses the
public knows nothing about

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.483
from every nation that
has a nuclear arsenal.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.270
The worry of a nuclear mishap

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.370
is not just the immediate damage done

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.200
by a hydrogen bomb explosion.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.940
It's also the misunderstanding

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.610
and retaliatory strikes that could arise.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.440
Imagine that in 1966,

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.230
instead of hydrogen bombs
falling off the coast of Spain,

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.820
the plane crash occurred closer

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.743
to the border with the Soviet Union.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.410
Humanity has been on the brink
of nuclear war many times

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.470
and so far we've been lucky.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:08.430
The closest we've likely
ever come was in October 1962

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.170
during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:14.040
The US Navy began dropping
signalling charges into the water

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.980
to bring a Soviet
submarine to the surface.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.200
Tensions were high and the submarine

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.440
had not been in radio
contact with Moscow for days.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.950
The captain of the submarine
decided that war had broken out

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.070
and he was about to
launch a nuclear torpedo.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.190
But the launch required the
authorization of three men.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.430
Two out of the three
authorised the launch,

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.280
but Vasili Arkhipov did not.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.960
A full-blown nuclear exchange

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.450
between the United States
and the Soviet Union

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:46.083
was avoided by the rational
decision of one person.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.250
The historian Arthur
Schlesinger Jr. later noted

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.830
that "this was not only
the most dangerous moment

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:54.390
of the Cold War.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.357
It was the most dangerous
moment in human history."

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.020
And during the Cuban Missile Crisis,

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.370
with the tensions between the US and USSR

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.250
at an all-time high,

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:09.300
both countries still conducted
high-altitude nuclear tests.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.180
The US set off a 410-kiloton bomb

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.250
50 kilometres above the Pacific Ocean

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.440
and a smaller 7-kiloton bomb

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.410
at an altitude of 147 kilometres.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:22.530
Two of the 300 kiloton tests
conducted by the Soviets

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.660
occurred in space.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.420
It's pretty hard to justify these actions.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.730
What if one of these
tests was thought to be

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:33.360
a nuclear first strike
leading to all-out war?

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.430
Because false alarms happen

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:37.530
for something a lot more innocuous

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.750
than nuclear tests in space.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.090
On the 26th of September, 1983,

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.550
the Soviet satellite-based
early warning system

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:45.690
detected the launch

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.970
of an intercontinental ballistic missile,

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:49.620
and their policy dictated

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.620
that if any inbound
missiles were detected,

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.930
there was to be an
immediate counter attack

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:56.700
against the United States.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.580
This would've likely led to all-out war.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.410
But the Soviet officer on duty

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.260
at the time of the
detection, Stanislav Petrov,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.000
was sceptical of the reading.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.700
He reasoned that if there
was a genuine first strike,

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.940
the US would launch hundreds
of ICBMs simultaneously,

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.590
not just one.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.540
The detection system then warned Petrov

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.900
of another four missiles
headed towards the USSR,

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:22.200
but these two, he dismissed as a glitch.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.640
Petrov was right.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.750
He made the right decision

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:28.500
and his clear thinking likely
saved millions of lives.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.000
The warning system malfunctioned,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.480
it confused sunlight reflecting
off high-altitude clouds

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.400
for ballistic missiles.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.360
After this incident,

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.130
Petrov took an early retirement

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:40.713
and later suffered a nervous breakdown.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:46.050
Another close call happened
on January 25th, 1995,

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:49.380
when scientists launched a
rocket off the coast of Norway.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.020
Their rocket was there to
study the Northern Lights

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.000
but Russian radar picked up this launch

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.700
as it had a similar
flight pattern and speed

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.970
as the submarine-launched Trident ICBM.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:01.770
The incident was serious enough

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.110
that a briefcase containing
the nuclear launch codes

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.233
was taken to the Russian
President, Boris Yeltsin.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:09.930
I think most people believe

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.090
the biggest threat
posed by nuclear weapons

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:14.280
is their deliberate use.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.010
There is this idea that as
long as nations only have them

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:18.390
and don't use them,

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.360
they could act as a
deterrent keeping us safer.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.700
But all of these incidents demonstrate

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.040
that the real risk of nuclear weapons

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.083
is some freak accident.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.380
So far, humanity has been lucky,

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.743
but how long until our luck runs out?

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.580
But there is hope.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.960
In 1986, there were more
than 70,000 nuclear weapons.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:47.730
In 2022, that number
had dropped to 12,705,

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.983
and more are being dismantled.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.180
But as long as there are any
nuclear weapons remaining,

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.227
the future of humanity is not safe.

00:14:57.227 --> 00:15:00.310
(electronic beeping)

00:15:01.804 --> 00:15:03.570
Hey, this part of the
video is brought to you

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.310
by Henson Shaving.

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:08.040
Close shaves are bad when
it comes to nuclear weapons

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:12.000
but they're great when
it comes to shaving.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.240
Henson is a company that was
started by aerospace machinists

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.160
who wanted to use their experience

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.690
in precision manufacturing

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:21.150
to create a better shaving experience.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:24.000
And honestly, I think they've succeeded.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.880
I've been using their AL13
for the past few months

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.490
and it's the best shave I've ever had.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:31.800
The razor is made using CNC machines

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.570
with incredibly tight tolerances,

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:37.590
so the blade sticks out
just .03 millimetres.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.140
This means that the blade
is perfectly supported

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.580
which reduces chatter,

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.130
the up and down movement of the blade.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:47.520
This reduction in chatter
reduces skin irritation.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.350
In fact, Henson conducted a test

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.900
where participants shaved
the left part of their face

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.160
with a multi-blade razor

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.500
and the right part with the AL13,

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.320
and they saw a statistically
significant reduction

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.740
in skin irritation when
the Henson razor was used.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.140
The AL13 is really high quality

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.240
and it uses standard double-edged blades

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.800
which are much less expensive

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.740
than the proprietary blades
sold by other companies.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.570
So, once you own a Henson razor,

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.770
the cost of shaving works out
to be just 3 to $5 per year,

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.900
depending on how often you shave.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.120
And because you're not
throwing away all that plastic,

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.430
it's also much better for the environment.

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.950
So, if you'd like to have
a better shaving experience

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:28.710
while saving money and
helping the environment,

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:31.410
head on over to HensonShaving.com

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:34.440
and enter code Veritasium
for 100 free blades

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.150
with the purchase of a razor.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:38.970
I wanna thank Henson for
sponsoring this part of the video

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.893
and I want to thank you for watching.
