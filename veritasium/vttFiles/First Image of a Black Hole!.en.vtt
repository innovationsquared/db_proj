00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.319
This is the first-ever image of a black
hole released by the Event Horizon

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.920
Telescope collaboration on April 10th
2019

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.240
It shows plasma orbiting the
supermassive black hole at the center of

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.850
the galaxy M87. The bright region shows
where plasma is coming towards us and

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.910
since it's traveling near the speed of
light it appears brighter when coming

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.440
towards us and dimmer when going away.
This is called relativistic beaming.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.290
From the images scientists can tell that the
plasma is orbiting clockwise. It takes

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.300
around 2 days for the plasma to complete
one orbit. Here we are looking at the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.649
black hole using electromagnetic waves
with a wavelength of 1.3 millimeters -

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.510
radio waves. This was the part of the
spectrum used to make the image because

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.890
it can show us the features close in to
the event horizon and it can pass

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.370
through the accretion disk and
interstellar dust to reach our

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.579
telescopes. The supermassive black hole
in M87 is very active meaning it's

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.590
constantly feeding on lots of matter
from its glowing hot accretion disk, but

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.020
it also has narrow collimated jets above
and below it here shown in blue, thought

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.180
to be created by incredibly strong
magnetic fields. The jets extend out at

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.759
least 5,000 lightyears and one of them
appears to be pointing almost straight

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.790
at us.
Relativistic beaming is again the reason

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.170
we can see the jet coming towards us in
this Hubble Space Telescope image but

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.970
not the one going away.
Since the jet is pointed almost straight

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.009
at us I'm thinking our perspective is
almost perpendicular to the accretion

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.390
disk but let's have a look at what we
would see if we were looking at

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.210
different orientations. The warping of
space-time around the black hole means

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.420
we can see light even from parts of the
accretion disk behind the black hole.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.900
They are lensed above and below the shadow region.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.350
Not gonna lie this is so trippy I

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.080
could stare at it for a long time. So the
big question most people are going to be

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.780
asking is why is the image so fuzzy?

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.600
The answer is because it's so tiny.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.980
Don't get me wrong the black hole itself is
huge, supermassive in fact. As measured

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.860
from this picture the black hole has a
mass 6.5 billion times that of our Sun.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.170
The actual size of its shadow is nearly
the size of our solar system, but located

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.490
fifty three and a half million light
years away its size from our perspective

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.540
is only about 40 micro arcseconds -
that's the angle it makes on the sky.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.840
To understand what that means
take the whole sky and divide it into

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:56.220
180 degrees. Then divide a degree into 60
arcminutes and an arcminute into 60

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:04.540
arcseconds. Divide an arcsecond into a
hundred

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.240
and into a hundred again

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.820
and into a hundred once more and that is the
size of the black hole shadow only about

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.080
40 micro arcseconds. It puts us at the
very limit of what we are

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.330
technologically capable of seeing. In
fact to get this sort of resolution due

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.320
to the basic law of physics the
diffraction limit we needed a telescope

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.750
the size of the Earth. That being
impractical the scientists used eight

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.530
telescopes spread across the globe. They
all simultaneously observed M87 and as

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.090
the earth rotated that helped fill in
the earth-sized telescope that they were

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.570
trying to simulate. But M87 was not the
only black hole they looked at. They also

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.820
observed the supermassive black hole at
the center of our Milky Way galaxy,

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:03.860
Sagittarius A* - they haven't yet release an image of this black hole, but this simulation shows what it might look like.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.880
it's much closer at
around 26,000 light years away but also

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.760
much smaller with a mass only four
million times that of our Sun. It's also

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.860
less active, only periodically gobbling
up matter, and it would have much more

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.320
variation over time with matter orbiting
every four to thirty minutes.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.620
That's probably why we'll have to wait a little longer to see the black hole at the center of our galaxy.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.240
For now, the striking image of the black hole in M87

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.960
confirms beyond a shadow of a doubt that black
holes do exist.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.640
The general theory of relativity published over a hundred
years ago is supported again in

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.720
spectacular fashion in the strongest
gravities and

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.220
at the limits of our ability to test the
theory.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.440
What I love about moments like this

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.920
is the ridiculous
extreme things these scientists did

00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:00.780
these 200 scientists in pursuit of a
goal that seemed impossible and yet they achieved it.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.020
I want to extend my personal
congratulations to everyone on the team

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.840
for an amazing discovery. I'll be linking
to all their work in the description
