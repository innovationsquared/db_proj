00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.270
- Imagine there's a hotel
with infinite rooms.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.053
They're numbered one, two,
three, four, and so on forever.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.110
This is the Hilbert Hotel
and you are the manager.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.050
Now it might seem

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.700
like you could accommodate
anyone who ever shows up,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.140
but there is a limit, a way to exceed

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.960
even the infinity of rooms
at the Hilbert Hotel.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.520
To start let's say only one
person is allowed in each room

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.820
and all the rooms are full.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.060
There are an infinite number of people,

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.660
in an infinite number of rooms.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.900
Then someone new shows
up and they want a room,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.160
but all the rooms are occupied.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.240
So what should you do?

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.750
Well, a lesser manager
might turn them away,

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.690
but you know about infinity.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.110
So you get on the PA

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.790
and you tell all the
guests to move down a room.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.810
So the person in room
one moves to room two.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.470
The one in room two moves to room three,

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.350
and so on down the line.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.560
And now you can put the
new guest in room one.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.670
If a bus shows up with a hundred people,

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.830
you know exactly what to do

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.580
just move everyone down a hundred rooms

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.023
and put the new guests
in their vacated rooms.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.210
But now let's say a bus shows
up that is infinitely long,

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.160
and it's carrying infinitely many people.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.220
You knew what to do with
a finite number of people

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.440
but what do you do with infinite people?

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.760
You think about it for a minute

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.220
and then come up with a plan.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.090
You tell each of your existing guests

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.230
to move to the room with
double their room number.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.620
So the person in room
one moves to room two,

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.730
room two moves to room four,

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.600
room three to room six and so on.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.520
And now all of the odd
numbered rooms are available.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.630
And you know, there are an
infinite number of odd numbers.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.310
So you can give each
person on the infinite bus,

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.593
a unique, odd numbered room.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.530
This hotel is really starting to feel

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.120
like it can fit everybody.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.610
And that's the beauty of infinity,

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.033
it goes on forever.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.630
And then all of a sudden
more infinite buses show up,

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.100
not just one or two,

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.340
but an infinite number of infinite buses.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.720
So, what can you do?

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.440
Well, you pull out an infinite
spreadsheet of course.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.310
You make a row for each bus,

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.520
bus 1 bus 2 bus 3 and so on.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.700
And a row at the top

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.780
for all the people who
are already in the hotel.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.910
The columns are for the
position each person occupies.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.670
So you've got hotel room
one, hotel room two,

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.700
hotel room three, et cetera.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.530
And then bus one seat
one, bus one seat two,

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.990
bus one seat three and so on.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.310
So each person gets a unique identifier

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.280
which is a combination of their vehicle

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.600
and their position in it.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.790
So how do you assign the rooms?

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.500
Well start in the top left corner

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.500
and draw a line that
zigzags back and forth

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.040
across the spreadsheet,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.850
going over each unique ID exactly once.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.870
Then imagine you pull on the
opposite ends of this line,

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.690
straightening it out.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.400
So we've gone from an
infinite by infinite grid,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.460
to a single infinite line.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.780
It's then pretty simple

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.030
just to line up each person on that line

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.370
with a unique room in the hotel.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.453
So everyone fits, no problem.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.400
But now a big bus pulls up.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.210
An infinite party bus with no seats.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.360
Instead, everyone on board is identified

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.980
by their unique name,
which is kind of strange.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.090
So their names all consist
of only two letters, A and B

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.090
But each name is infinitely long.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.110
So someone is named A, B, B,
A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A,

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.570
and so on forever.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.880
Someone else is named AB,
AB, AB, AB, AB, et cetera.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.510
On this bus, there's a person with

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.000
every possible infinite
sequence of these two letters.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.210
Now, ABB, A, A, A, A, I'll
call him Abba for short.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.100
He comes into the hotel
to arrange the rooms,

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.417
but you tell him,

00:03:54.417 --> 00:03:59.417
"Sorry, there's no way we can
fit all of you in the hotel."

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.197
And he's like, "What do you mean?

00:04:01.197 --> 00:04:02.767
"There's an infinite number of us

00:04:02.767 --> 00:04:04.917
"and you have an infinite number of rooms.

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:06.820
"Why won't this work?"

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.110
So you show him.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.220
you pull out your infinite
spreadsheet again and

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.410
start assigning rooms
to people on the bus.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.860
So you have room one, assign it to ABBA,

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.780
and then room two to
AB AB AB AB repeating.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.840
And you keep going,
putting a different string

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.737
of As and Bs beside each room number.

00:04:23.737 --> 00:04:25.827
"Now here's the problem," you tell ABBA,

00:04:25.827 --> 00:04:29.017
"let's say we have a
complete infinite list.

00:04:29.017 --> 00:04:31.537
"I can still write down
the name of a person,

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:33.960
"who doesn't yet have a room."

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.030
The way you do it is you
take the first letter

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.410
of the first name and
flip it from an A to a B.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.390
Then take the second
letter of the second name

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.450
and flip it from a B to an A.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.340
And you keep doing this
all the way down the list.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.030
And the name you write down
is guaranteed to appear

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.570
nowhere on that list.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.080
Because it won't match the
first letter of the first name,

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.710
or the second letter of the second name,

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.210
or the third letter of the third name.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.840
It will be different from
every name on the list,

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.010
by at least one character.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.913
The letter on the diagonal.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.112
The number of rooms in the
Hilbert Hotel is infinite, sure,

00:05:10.112 --> 00:05:12.280
but it is countably infinite.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.760
Meaning there are as many rooms

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.930
as there are positive
integers one to infinity.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.130
By contrast, the number
of people on the bus is

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.000
uncountably infinite.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.530
If you try to match up
each one with an integer,

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.790
you will still have people leftover.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.203
Some infinities are bigger than others.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.080
So there's a limit to the
people that you can fit,

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.370
in the Hilbert Hotel.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.760
This is mind blowing enough,

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.890
but what's even crazier is that

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.320
the discovery of different
sized infinities,

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.620
sparked a line of inquiry
that led directly,

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.210
to the invention of the device

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.100
you're watching this on right now.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.660
But that's a story for another time.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.243
(upbeat music)
