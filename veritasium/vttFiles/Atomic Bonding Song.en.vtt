00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
In my outer electron shell

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Lies an electron all by itself

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I seek elation

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Through oxidation

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I have always felt incomplete

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
One electron shy of eighteen

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I’ve the highest

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Electron affinity

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
If we exchange this one electron

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We’ll both achieve noble gas config’ration

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And we’ll release energy

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
As ions you’ll see

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
A bond

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Made by metals and non-metals

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I’m positive

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I’m negative

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.000
A force of attraction creates this bond

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Made by metals and non-metals

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Ionic bonds

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Covalent bonds

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Metallic, these are the bonds of chemistry

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The octet rule says atoms like eight

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Electrons in their outermost state.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I’ll share mine with you

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I’ll share with you

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
If we both share these six electrons

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
We’ll both achieve noble gas config’ration

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And we’ll release energy

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Covalent there’ll be

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
A Bond

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Electronegativity

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Is similar for non-metals

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And so,we share this bond of electrons

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Electronegativity

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Ionic Bonds

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Covalent Bonds

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Metallic,these are the bonds of chemistry

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Free

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Electrons all around

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Mutual attractive forces abound

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
In this way

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I will stay

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Crystalline with you

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Our Bond

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Ionic bonds

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Covalent bonds

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Metallic
00:03:52,00:03:02
These are the bonds of chemistry
