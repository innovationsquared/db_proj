00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:08.009
There are a lot of misconceptions out there and this a video about one of the most common ones.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:15.000
So I went around asking people 'what makes the Moon go around the Earth?'  and they told me..

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:22.619
The Earth puts a gravitational force on the moon
But does the moon put a gravitational pull on the Earth?

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:32.039
Pull on the Earth yes. It does hence we have tides ETc the moon falls on the earth, [too] it affects like the tides and

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.010
women and yes

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.440
It [does] very powerful

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.775
does the moon pull on the Earth

00:00:39.775 --> 00:00:40.680
probably that as well

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.440
Yeah

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.760
So what I want to know is

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.190
How does that force that the moon exerts on the Earth how does that compare in terms of size?

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.380
To the Force the Earth exerts on the moon

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.960
Well...

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.879
No scientist, but I think that one would be more powerful than that one

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.309
It's got a greater force coming from the Earth because it's greater mass is the Earth has more

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.189
Mass [cuz] it's a bigger mess. I thought greater mass is more [equals] more force [guys]

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.689
Does the moon pull on the earth?

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:05.908
Yes

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.229
But a lot less

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.840
Yeah, not as much as the Earth pulls on the moon.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.180
Yeah

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.538
Yeah, but a little bit

00:01:12.538 --> 00:01:13.038
not [very] strongly.

00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:14.020
Yes

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.960
But much much much much smaller because if it's mass [less], [not] size

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.560
Because it's smaller. It's much smaller than [that] than the Earth

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.779
because it's smaller. This is small

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.508
Allow me to let you in on a little secret

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.390
Everyone got it wrong

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:38.009
The Force that attracts the moon to the Earth is exactly the same size as the force that attracts the Earth to the moon

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.789
So what's going on here? Why did everyone get it wrong?

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.820
Well, I think it comes down to cause and effect

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.779
The effect of the force on the moon is quite clear the moon goes in circles around the Earth

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.079
but the effect of that force on the Earth is

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.600
basically negligible; the Earth

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.169
barely wobbles at all So people interpret this

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.729
Negligible effect as

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.419
Indicating there's very little force affecting the Earth

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.059
But that is forgetting the third key piece of the puzzle which is inertia

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.660
Inertia is the tendency of Mass to Maintain State of motion

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.170
Since the Earth has a greater, mass

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.759
It has a greater, inertia and so even with the same amount of force on it

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.490
It doesn't accelerate that much now the funny thing [is] many of the [people] I interviewed

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.330
Could state Newton's third law which is every [force] has not equal and opposite reaction

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.420
Something about Newton's law doesn't seem to fit into that

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.080
[just] yet. You're good at this wait

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.799
Which Newton's law are we talking about the whole equal and opposite force thing?

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.849
Yeah, that one. So tell me what you're thinking man [ah] well

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.680
Did one would think that if you're into putting a force on me I would be putting an equal Force upon it

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.740
So why didn't they apply it to this problem?

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.330
Well, I think they may have memorized the words, but not really [believed] Newton's third law in their core

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.420
Did they really feel it in their spleen [I]?

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.180
Don't think they did so

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.739
Allow me to try to convince you, all of you spleen included, that Newton's third law really is true

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.199
Let's consider two objects

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.369
Initially they have the same Mass 1 kilogram each

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.849
So obviously the gravitational force of attraction must be the same on both of the objects

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.799
Now let's add a second kilogram to the first object

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:46.030
The Force on the second object will now be twice as great because that 1 kilogram is attracted

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.660
equally to each of the kilograms in the first object

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.799
But what is often forgotten is that new kilogram is

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.530
also

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:02.380
attracted to the second object meaning that the total force on each object is still the same they're attracted to each other with an

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.540
equal and opposite Force

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.240
We could add a third kilogram

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.380
And we would find the same thing the force on both objects is still the same

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.730
Even though the object on the left has [3] times the mass of the object on the right?

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:23.799
So we can see that no matter what the mass, any two objects will have the same gravitational force towards each other.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:32.809
Can you feel Newton's third law in your spleen now? It should settle inside you and become a part of you
