00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.039
This is a water jet pack... but no, that's
not me flying it.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.480
This is me.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.560
It's harder than it looks, ok?

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.150
But to understand how it works, we need to
first talk rocket science.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.310
Rocket science is meant to be one of the most
complicated things in the world, but the basic

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.570
principle is incredibly simple.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.089
It's just Newton's 3rd law -- all forces come
in pairs, which are equal and opposite.

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:44.000
To demonstrate this, I'm using a fire extinguisher
on a skateboard.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.870
As the carbon dioxide is forced out the back
of the extinguisher, it puts a force forwards

00:00:48.870 --> 00:01:02.690
on me causing me to accelerate.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.700
Or that's the theory anyway.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.100
If you look closely, you can spot the exact
moment I realize this is a fail.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.790
So what was the problem here?

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.160
Well the force applied to me by the carbon
dioxide is equal to the rate of mass ejected

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.960
out the back of the fire extinguisher, call
it m-dot for short, multiplied by the velocity

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.970
of that exhaust gas.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.580
So in this case the carbon dioxide wasn't
ejected fast enough to create a big enough

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.390
force and overcome the small frictional forces
to get me to accelerate.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.670
But it can be done as has been demonstrated
many times on Youtube.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:53.200
When the space shuttle lifts off, exhaust
gasses exit the nozzle at 3 to 4 km/s, ejecting

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.549
an amount of mass of 9000 kg/s.

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.290
This creates thrust equal to 30,000,000 N
or the equivalent of about 2 million decent

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.049
fire extinguishers.

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.660
Now imagine you are an astronaut preparing
for launch in the space shuttle.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.930
You'd be seated not vertically but horizontally,
perpendicular to the acceleration.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.160
That's because the human body is a bit like
a water balloon where the water represents

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.010
your blood and the balloon represents your
harder parts like your skeleton.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.570
Now, if you are accelerated up really quickly,
then your skeleton accelerates up at that

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.350
rate but your blood tends to stay where it
is.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.859
And this results in the blood ending up in
your feet.

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.549
Now since there's not enough oxygen going
to your brain you would black out.

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:46.480
But fighter pilots face an arguably worse
fate when they accelerate down too fast, because

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.720
then the blood all rushes to their head and
they suffer something called a red-out, where

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.280
the blood actually comes out of their eyes,
nose, mouth, and ears.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.670
But back to astronauts, since you are reclined,
at worst the blood will end up in the back

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.700
of your body and the back of your head, but
your brain will still have enough oxygen to

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.130
remain conscious.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.150
Now as the spacecraft lifts off and starts
speeding up, the acceleration is initially

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.030
a very reasonable five to eight meters per
second squared - that's less acceleration

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.120
than an object in free fall here at the surface
of Earth.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.320
But as the spacecraft continues to burn fuel,
its mass decreases, while the thrust remains

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.820
essentially constant.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.600
Now Newton's second law says that the acceleration
of an object equals the net force applied

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.949
to it divided by its mass.

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:43.160
So as the mass decreases, the acceleration
increases -- and it increases at an increasing

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.160
rate.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.640
So much so that at the end of the rocket burn
the thrust has to actually be limited in order

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.590
to keep the acceleration from going over three
g's -- that's three times the acceleration

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.730
due to gravity or about 30 meters per second
squared.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.070
Now the term g-force has been invented to
give a sense of the amount of force experienced

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.090
by astronauts, in multiples of the force we
experience everyday.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.230
Right now you are experiencing one g-force,
probably on your butt if you're sitting down

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.030
-- can you feel that force?

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.180
But accelerating at three g's you would experience
three g-forces.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.910
So the force between your back and the chair
would be the same as if you had two of you

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.450
stacked on top of you.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.900
Hey, pipe down below, huh?

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.960
You guys are heavy.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.000
Oh, man.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.120
You know that feeling when you're taking off
in a plane and it feels like you're pressed

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.640
into the seat, well really it's the seat pressing
into you.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.900
But if you imagine that feeling times 20,
that's what it would be like to be taking

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.660
off in the space shuttle.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.700
Now an interesting side note is that we think
of the space shuttle's acceleration as being

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.620
mainly vertical because that's what we see
when it lifts off.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.460
But that's actually not true.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.210
Once the space shuttle exits the thicker part
of the atmosphere, it turns horizontal and

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.250
accelerates up to its orbital velocity 28,000
km/h.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.600
So most of the acceleration of a spacecraft,
in orbit anyway, is horizontal.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.130
So how is this like a jet pack?

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.760
Well unlike the shuttle, you don't carry your
own propellant with you.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.700
And also, there's no chemical reaction releasing
energy that drives the propellant downwards.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:32.100
Instead the jetski pumps water out of the
lake and up that hose at a rate up to 60 litres

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.150
per second.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.560
And then right on these nozzles here, the
water changes directions.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.710
So it goes from coming up to being fired out
the bottom, and that change in momentum as

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.770
it goes over the bend is what actually pushed
the jetpack up.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.280
Because the jetpack's pushing down on the
water, so by Newton's third law, the water

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.480
has to push up on the jetpack
generating 1800 Newtons of thrust, that's

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.700
roughly equivalent to 150 decent fire extinguishers.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.620
This could accelerate me at up to 1.5 g's

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.170
And you use your hands in order to steer.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:08.211
Lifting up to drive yourself upwards, moving
your hands down to accelerate forwards, and

00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:14.000
pretend like you're turning a big wheel very
gently in order to turn side to side.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.670
One thing you don't want to do is try to explain
the physics of the jetpack while in the air.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:29.280
That's what I was trying to do here...

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.210
While you're learning your thrust is controlled
by your instructor so if he sees you doing

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.430
something stupid he'll just turn off the thrust
and drop you into the lake so you don't hurt

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.680
yourself.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.010
That's generally a good idea unless you're
on a collision course with the jetski.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:49.790
I got a pretty fat lip from doing this but
thankfully all my teeth were intact.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.750
When the thrust is equal to my weight plus
the weight of the water in the hose, then

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.330
I can hover or move with constant velocity.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.480
It's a common misconception that you need
a little bit of unbalanced force to move with

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.560
a constant velocity -- in truth if the forces
are balanced, you will continue moving with

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.990
whatever constant velocity you have.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.860
The other common misconception about rockets
is that you need something to push off like

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.360
the atmosphere.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:20.240
In reality, what you are pushing off is the
propellant, so even without the air around

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.760
a water jetpack would still work because you're
pushing off the water that is coming out those

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.760
nozzles.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.690
If you want to go jetpacking I recommend you
go easy on the controls.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:34.020
I mean the worst thing you can do is overcompensate,
which I think is a typical human reaction,

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.920
because you're reacting to where you are and
how fast you're moving and you're not reacting

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.210
to acceleration which is the real thing that
you can control.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:45.010
So even if you're coming down towards the
water quite quickly you may be slowing down

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.600
so it may be ok and you don't need to adjust
anything.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.230
You just need to trust that the jetpack will
get you out of any trouble.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:58.860
It's a pretty incredibly experience, feeling
the power of that water rushing passed you.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:03.160
It's the closest I've gotten to flying really.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:09.710
That's the power of physics.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:10.770
Now many of you may not know that I have a
second channel

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:15.110
