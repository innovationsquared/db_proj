00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:05.939
In this phone, there are nearly 100 million
transistors, in this computer there's over

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:06.939
a billion.

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:12.990
The transistor is in virtually every electronic
device we use: TV's, radios, Tamagotchis.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.490
But how does it work?

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.340
Well the basic principle is actually incredibly
simple.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.400
It works just like this switch, so it controls
the flow of electric current.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.939
It can be off, so you could call that the
zero state or it could be on, the one state.

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.180
And this is how all of our information is
now stored and processed, in zeros and ones,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.490
little bits of electric current.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.870
But unlike this switch, a transistor doesn't
have any moving parts.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.140
And it also doesn't require a human controller.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.300
Furthermore, it can be switched on and off
much more quickly than I can flick this switch.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.800
And finally, and most importantly it is incredibly
tiny.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.360
Well this is all thanks to the miracle of
semiconductors or rather I should say the

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.860
science of semiconductors.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.230
Pure silicon is a semiconductor, which means
it conducts electric current better than insulators

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.310
but not as well as metals.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.740
This is because an atom of silicon has four
electrons in its outermost or valence shell.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.920
This allows it to form bonds with its four
nearest neighbours,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.080
Hidey ho there!

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.080
G'day
Wasaaaaap!?

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.060
So it forms a tetrahedral crystal.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.670
But since all these electrons are stuck in
bonds, few ever get enough energy to escape

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.330
their bonds and travel through the lattice.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.070
So having a small number of mobile charges
is what makes silicon a semi-conductor.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.590
Now this wouldn't be all that useful without
a semiconductor's secret weapon -- doping.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.049
You've probably heard of doping, it's when
you inject a foreign substance in order to

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.250
improve performance.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.720
Yeah it's actually just like that, except
on the atomic level.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.600
There are two types of doping called n-type
and p-type.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.370
To make n-type semiconductor, you take pure
silicon and inject a small amount of an element

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.100
with 5 valence electrons,
like Phosphorous.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.270
This is useful because Phosphorous is similar
enough to silicon that it can fit into the

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.970
lattice, but it brings with it an extra electron.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.670
So this means now the semiconductor has more
mobile charges and so it conducts current

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.900
better.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.620
In p-type doping, an element with only three
valence electrons is added to the lattice.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.620
Like Boron.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.620
Now this creates a 'hole' - a place where
there should be an electron, but there isn't.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.349
But this still increases the conductivity
of the silicon because electrons can move

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:36.730
into it.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.920
Now although it is electrons that are moving,
we like to talk about the holes moving around

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.490
-- because there's far fewer of them.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.569
Now since the hole is the lack of an electron,
it actually acts as a positive charge.

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.660
And this is why p-type semiconductor is actually
called p-type.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.600
The p stands for positive - it's positive
charges, these holes, which are moving and

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.090
conducting the current.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.310
Now it's a common misconception that n-type
semiconductors are negatively charged and

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.350
p-type semiconductors are positively charged.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.530
That's not true, they are both neutral because
they have the same number of electrons and

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.020
protons inside them.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.879
The n and the p actually just refer to the
sign of charge that can move within them.

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.200
So in n-type, it's negative electrons which
can move, and in p-type

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.450
it's a positive hole that moves.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.190
But they're both neutral!

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.500
A transistor is made with both n-type and
p-type semiconductors.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.310
A common configuration has n on the ends with
p in the middle.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.120
Just like a switch a transistor has an electrical
contact at each end and these are called the

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.050
source and the drain.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.570
But instead of a mechanical switch, there
is a third electrical contact called the gate,

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.410
which is insulated from the semiconductor
by an oxide layer.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.050
When a transistor is made, the n and p-types
don't keep to themselves -- electrons actually

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.819
diffuse from the n-type, where there are more
of them into the p-type

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.780
to fill the holes.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.370
This creates something called the depletion
layer.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.989
What's been depleted?

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.620
Charges that can move.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.700
There are no more free electrons in the n-type
-- why?

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.349
Because they've filled the holes in the p-type.

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.870
Now this makes the p-type negative thanks
to the added electrons.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.940
And this is important because the p-type will
now repel any electrons that try to come across

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.239
from the n-type.

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.600
So the depletion layer actually acts as a
barrier, preventing the flow of electric current

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.990
through the transistor.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.919
So right now the transistor is off, it's like
an open switch, it's in the zero state.

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.930
To turn it on, you have to apply a small positive
voltage to the gate.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.630
This attracts the electrons over and overcomes
that repulsion from the depletion.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.930
It actually shrinks the depletion layer so
that electrons can move through and form a

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.479
conducting channel.

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.889
So the transistor is now on, it's in the one
state.

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.430
This is remarkable because just by exploiting
the properties of a crystal we've been able

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.800
to create a switch that doesn't have any moving
parts, that can be turned on and off very

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.400
quickly just with a voltage, and most importantly
it can be made tiny.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:12.050
Transistors today are only about 22nm wide,
which means they are only about 50 atoms across.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.850
But to keep up with Moore's law, they're going
to have to keep getting smaller.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.169
Moore's Law states that every two years the
number of transistors on a chip should double.

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:25.970
And there is a limit, as those terminals get
closer and closer together, quantum effects

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.570
become more significant and electrons can
actually tunnel from one side to the other.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.699
So you may not be able to make a barrier high
enough to stop them from flowing.

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:39.850
Now this will be a real problem for the future
of transistors, but we'll probably only face

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.190
that another ten years down the track.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.710
So until then transistors, the way we know
them, are going to keep getting better.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:53.380
Once you have let's say three hundred of these
qubits, then you have like two to the three

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.080
hundred classical bits.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.439
Which is as many particles as there are in
the universe.
