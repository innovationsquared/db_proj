Sometimes the simplest questions have the most amazing answers.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.340
Like "Is there a speed limit, in the universe?"

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.540
"Where does the sun get that energy from?"

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.980
"Where do they get the matter, to *make* the tree?"

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.440
"What is a candle flame really made of?"

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.980
"Whoaah!"

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.760
"How does it do that?"

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.680
"Go the laws of physics!"

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.780
"I can't see the X!"

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.340
"I guess the question is, 'Why not?'"

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.160
I make videos about science.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.020
"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself."

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.740
