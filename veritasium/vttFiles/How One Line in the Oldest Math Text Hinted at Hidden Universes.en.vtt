00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
(dramatic music)

00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:01.830
- [Derek] A single sentence

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.540
in one of the oldest math books

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.810
held the key to
understanding our universe.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.690
Euclid's "Elements" has been
published in more editions

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.420
than any other book except the Bible.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.830
It was the go to math
text for over 2,000 years.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.030
But for all that time,

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.390
mathematicians were
skeptical of a single line

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.493
which seemed like a mistake.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.840
Ultimately, some of the
greatest math minds realized

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.630
that Euclid wasn't wrong after all,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.880
but there was more to the story.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.170
Slight tweaks to this line
opened up strange new universes

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.013
out of nothing.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.130
Surprisingly, 80 years later,

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.100
we found out those strange new universes

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.063
are core to understanding
our own universe.

00:00:51.735 --> 00:00:52.568
(contemplative music)

00:00:52.568 --> 00:00:54.060
Around 300 BC,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.570
the Greek mathematician, Euclid,
takes on a massive project

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.840
to summarize all mathematics
known at the time,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.700
to essentially create the one book

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.230
that contains everything

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.290
that everyone knows about mathematics.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.330
But that's no easy task.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.320
See, before Euclid, there was
a bit of a problem with math.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.000
- People would prove things,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.507
but they would just be
going around in circles.

00:01:16.507 --> 00:01:18.517
"Why does a triangle have 180 degrees?"

00:01:18.517 --> 00:01:19.747
"'Cause if you take two parallel lines -"

00:01:19.747 --> 00:01:21.067
"Yeah, but why do parallel lines exist?"

00:01:21.067 --> 00:01:22.537
"Oh, that's because you can make a square.

00:01:22.537 --> 00:01:23.580
"Why does a square exist?"

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.840
You have this infinite recursion

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.280
of what the fundamental reason
why something is true is.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.810
- [Derek] It's kind of
like in the dictionary,

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.960
every word is defined
in terms of other words,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.973
so how do you get to ground truth?

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.680
Euclid used a solution that
was pioneered by the Greeks.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.790
Let's just accept a few of
the most simple, basic things

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.180
as being true, these are our postulates.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.980
Then, based upon these postulates,

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.440
we can prove theorems one at a time,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.630
building up our math using logic,

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.150
so that as long as those
first statements are true,

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.340
then everything else
that follows from them

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.100
must definitely be true.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.470
He had perfected the gold standard

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.480
for rigorous mathematical proof

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.793
that all modern math relies on.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.340
Euclid used this method

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.790
when he published his 13 book
series called, "The Elements,"

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.670
in which he proved 465 theorems,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.700
covering almost all of
mathematics known at the time,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.133
including geometry and number theory.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.600
And all these theorems depended
on were some definitions,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.603
a few common notions, and five postulates.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.590
- We go right to book one,

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.150
and book one starts with definitions,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.290
you gotta start somewhere.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.123
And the definition is,

00:02:38.123 --> 00:02:40.290
"A point is that which has no part.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.360
A line is a breadthless length."

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.270
And, "The ends of lines are points."

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.310
By line, he really means a curve,

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.937
and then it has some ends.

00:02:48.937 --> 00:02:51.840
"A straight line is a
line that lies evenly

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.880
within the points on itself."

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.650
And then so on, and so forth.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.540
He's got 23 definitions,

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.993
then he's got the five postulates.

00:02:58.993 --> 00:03:00.450
(energetic music)

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.490
- [Derek] The first four are simple.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.350
One, if you have two points,

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.780
you can draw a straight line between them.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.490
Two, if you have a straight line,

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.040
you can extend it indefinitely.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.390
Three, given a center and a
radius, you can draw a circle.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.820
And the fourth is that all right angles

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.710
are equal to each other.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.780
- [Alex] But postulate
five gets the big guns.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.920
- [Derek] Which is that,

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.530
if a straight line falling
on two straight lines

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.440
makes the interior angles on the same side

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.630
less than two right angles,

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.390
the two straight lines,
if produced indefinitely,

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.830
meet on that side,

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.653
on which are the angles less
than the two right angles.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.020
- What the hell is he talking about?

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.853
That's a postulate?

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:42.090
Like all of these are,

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.230
you know, half of a sentence,

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.790
and they're all blatantly obvious.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.950
And then comes five, out of left field,

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.110
and it's like an entire paragraph.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.282
What is he doing?

00:03:50.282 --> 00:03:51.240
(contemplative music)

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.580
- [Derek] This made
mathematicians suspicious;

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.700
it seemed like Euclid made a mistake.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.280
Greek philosopher Proclus
thought Postulate 5

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.070
ought even to be struck outta
the postulates altogether,

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.693
for it is a theorem.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.850
But if it's a theorem,

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.050
we should be able to prove it

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.790
from the first four postulates,

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.920
so that's what many people tried.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.140
Some, including Ptolemy and Proclus,

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.890
believed they had
succeeded, but they hadn't.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.750
In fact, all they'd managed to do

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.233
was just restate Postulate
5 in different words.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.960
Here's one formulation.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.560
If you have a line, and a
point that is not on that line,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.470
then there is a single unique line

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.620
which will be parallel to the first line.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.453
For this reason,

00:04:35.453 --> 00:04:38.790
the fifth postulate is often
called the Parallel postulate.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:39.623
(contemplative music)

00:04:39.623 --> 00:04:41.580
When the method of direct proof failed,

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.540
other mathematicians, including
al-Haytham and Omar Khayyam,

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.710
tried a different approach,
proof by contradiction.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.180
The idea is simple,

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.520
you keep the first four
postulates the same,

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.890
but assume that the
fifth postulate is false.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.770
Then you use those new
postulates to prove theorems,

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.390
and if that leads to a contradiction,

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.550
for example, true equals false,

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.790
well, then it means your new
fifth postulate must be wrong.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.500
And, therefore, the only
remaining option would be

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.710
that Euclid's version of the
fifth postulate is correct,

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.650
and you would've proven
the fifth postulate.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.820
So, what would it look like

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.860
if the fifth postulate were false?

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.030
Well, according to Euclid,

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.830
through a point not on a line,

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.910
there could only be one line
that is parallel to the first.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.610
One alternative is that
there are no parallel lines

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.890
that you could draw through that point.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:29.790
- Well, people tried that,

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.500
and they realized that thin lines

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.790
had to be finite in length.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.130
And they're like, "Well, that can't be."

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.960
- [Derek] So this option was ruled out,

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.700
it contradicted the second postulate,

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.060
which states that lines can
be extended indefinitely.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.560
The other alternative

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.140
is that you can draw more
than one parallel line

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.960
through a point not on the first line.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.793
- So that's what they would do,

00:05:49.793 --> 00:05:51.450
they would assume the
postulate five fails,

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.490
and they're like,

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.828
"This has gotta be wrong.
Where's the contradiction?"

00:05:53.828 --> 00:05:55.329
They couldn't find the contradiction.

00:05:55.329 --> 00:05:56.162
(intense acoustic music)

00:05:56.162 --> 00:05:58.380
- [Derek] So proof by
contradiction also failed.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.500
In total, mathematicians
spent more than 2,000 years

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.390
trying to prove the fifth postulate,

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.583
but everyone who tried failed.

00:06:07.585 --> 00:06:09.480
(contemplative music)

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.950
Then, around 1820, János
Bolyai, a 17 year old student,

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.670
started spending his days and
nights working on the mystery.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.157
His father became worried,
and he wrote to his son,

00:06:21.157 --> 00:06:24.150
"You must not attempt this
approach to parallels.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.250
I know this way to the very end,

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.410
I have traversed this bottomless night,

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.920
which extinguished all
light and joy in my life.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.390
I intrigue you, leave the
science of parallels alone.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.337
Learn from my example."

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.750
But the young Bolyai didn't
listen to his father,

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.500
he could not leave the
science of parallels alone.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.790
After years of work,

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.100
he realized that maybe the fifth postulate

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.470
can't be proven from the other four,

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.903
it could be completely independent.

00:06:56.407 --> 00:06:57.240
(soft music)

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.170
See, according to Euclid,

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.110
you could have only one
parallel line through a point.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.490
But Bolyai imagined a world

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.770
where there could be more
than one parallel line

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.450
through that point.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:07.560
But how?

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.770
Well, who said you needed
to have a flat surface?

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.750
On a surface that is curved like this,

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.520
you can draw more than one line

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.250
that is parallel to the original line.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.670
But wait a second, those
lines don't look straight.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.560
Well, what makes straight lines special

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.470
is that they're the shortest
paths between two points.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.650
On this surface, those
shortest paths just look bent,

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.200
because the surface is curved.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.150
Here's a more familiar example.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.460
Airplanes always try to
fly the shortest path

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.570
between two cities,

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.670
they're basically flying
in a straight line,

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:41.190
but that line doesn't
look straight on a map

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.770
because the surface is curved.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.110
These shortest paths on curved surfaces

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.660
are called geodesics.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.940
So, all these lines are straight,

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.990
they just don't look it,

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:53.700
because the world Bolyai had imagined

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.440
turned out to be curved.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.173
We now know this as hyperbolic geometry.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.150
- You know, when I used to
think of the hyperbolic plane,

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.270
I would just imagine
it as one giant saddle.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.370
But that's not really what it is,

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.170
the hyperbolic plane is much more like

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.450
this piece of crocheting.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.420
So, it starts out pretty
flat and even in the middle,

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.310
but as you move outwards,

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.310
more and more fabric is created,

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:24.420
and that would push parallel lines apart.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.310
And the further and further out you go,

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.890
the amount of fabric grows exponentially,

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.460
and that ends up causing
this crumpling effect.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.860
So if you really wanna think
about the hyperbolic plane,

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.810
I think you've gotta think about

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:38.370
saddles, on saddles, on saddles,

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.611
like it's a infinite crumpling mess.

00:08:41.611 --> 00:08:42.444
(soft music)

00:08:42.444 --> 00:08:43.470
- [Derek] But that little piece of crochet

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.600
isn't the full hyperbolic plane.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.970
To show that, we need to make a map,

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:52.020
one that fits the entire
plane into a disc.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.100
To show how this works,

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.190
we're gonna fill the entire
plane with these triangles.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.410
Starting in the middle,
just as with the crochet,

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.120
things look pretty normal,

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.520
but as you go farther out from the center,

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.170
you get all this extra space,

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.990
so you can fit more and more triangles.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.730
So they appear smaller,

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.880
but they are actually the same size.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.040
Now, since the hyperbolic
plane is infinite,

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.320
you can keep adding triangles forever,

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.840
and they all need to fit on the disk.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.460
So as you get closer to the edge,

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.330
the triangles will appear
smaller, and smaller, and smaller,

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.460
infinitely smaller, never ending,

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.790
and you can never quite reach the edge.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.580
This is known as the Poincare Disk Model.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.890
Here, straight lines are arcs of circles

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.650
that intersect the disc at 90 degrees,

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.480
and just like on our original shape,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.210
a straight line down the
middle appears straight,

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:46.200
while straight lines next
to it appear to curve away.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.260
What's remarkable is that
Bolyai didn't have a model

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.180
of hyperbolic geometry yet,

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.330
he was just drawing Euclidean
triangles with the assumption

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.940
that Euclid's fifth postulate didn't hold.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.710
And while Bolyai found

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:00.570
that the behavior in hyperbolic geometry

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.730
is very different than Euclid's,

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:06.114
mathematically, it seemed
just as consistent.

00:10:06.114 --> 00:10:07.770
(soft music)

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.977
In 1823, the 20-year-old
János wrote to his dad,

00:10:11.977 --> 00:10:16.290
"I have discovered such wonderful
things that I was amazed.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:20.907
Out of nothing, I have created
a strange new universe."

00:10:23.991 --> 00:10:24.824
(contemplative music)

00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:25.680
But Bolyai had been doing more

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.320
than just tackling ancient math mysteries.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.300
In his twenties, he joined the army,

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.970
where he continued developing
two of his other passions,

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.180
playing the violin and dueling.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.830
He had mastered both,

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:41.250
but with a sword in
particular, he was unmatched.

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.160
Perhaps because of his many
talents, Bolyai grew arrogant,

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.810
and found it difficult to accept authority

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.250
from his superiors.

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.190
That made him hard to get along with.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.070
This reached a peak when,
during one of his deployments,

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.500
13 cavalry officers from his garrison

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.453
challenged him to a duel.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.090
Bolyai accepted their challenge,

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.430
on the condition that
after every two duels,

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.820
he could play for a little
while on his violin.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.220
Bolyai fought each of them in succession,

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.410
winning all 13 duels,

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:13.863
and leaving behind all his
adversaries on the square.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.160
While Bolyai loved dueling,

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.620
his first love was still mathematics.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.030
In 1832,

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.360
9 years after he discovered
his strange new universe,

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.360
he published his findings
as a 24 page appendix

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.683
to his father's textbook.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.730
Extremely proud and excited
about his son's work,

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:33.990
Farkas Bolyai sent it

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.630
to perhaps the greatest
mathematician of all time,

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.150
Carl Friedrich Gauss.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.710
After careful examination,

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.547
Gauss replied a few months later,

00:11:42.547 --> 00:11:45.990
"To praise it would
amount to praising myself

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:48.750
for the entire content of the work

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:52.080
coincides almost exactly
with my own meditations,

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.925
which have occupied my mind
for the past 30 or 35 years."

00:11:55.925 --> 00:11:56.790
(soft music)

00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:00.090
Years earlier, Gauss had
wandered a similar path.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:03.300
In 1824, he wrote a private
letter to one of his friends,

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.990
in which he describes
discovering a curious geometry,

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:10.080
one with paradoxical,
and to the uninitiated,

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.763
absurd theorems.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.407
For example, Gauss writes,

00:12:14.407 --> 00:12:16.290
"The three angles of a triangle

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.720
become as small as one wishes,

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.750
if only the sides are taken large enough.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.460
Yet the area of the triangle

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:26.640
can never exceed a definite limit."

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.570
In other words,

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.540
you can have a triangle
that's infinitely long,

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.463
but the area is finite.

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:36.600
You can see why by using
the Poincare disk model.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.030
A small triangle looks pretty ordinary,

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.740
but as you make it bigger,

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.250
the angles start to become
smaller and smaller.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.950
Eventually, all those angles go to zero,

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:51.090
because all these lines
intersect the disk at 90 degrees.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.550
Now, these lines are infinitely long,

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:57.213
but because of the geometry,
the area is finite.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.237
In the same private letter, Gauss wrote,

00:13:01.237 --> 00:13:03.690
"All my efforts to
discover a contradiction

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:07.440
and inconsistency in this
non-Euclidean geometry

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.200
have been without success."

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.960
Just like Bolyai, Gauss had
found that this geometry

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.150
seemed thoroughly consistent.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.490
He named it non-Euclidean geometry,

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:18.960
a name that stuck.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.160
It describes geometries

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.410
where Euclid's first four postulates hold,

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:24.270
but the fifth doesn't.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.430
But Gauss decided not
to publish his findings

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.023
for fear of ridicule.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.800
This aversion to a
different kind of geometry

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.900
should at least be a little surprising,

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.910
because there is one other geometry

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:39.330
that we should be very familiar
with, spherical geometry,

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.957
since we all live on a sphere.

00:13:41.957 --> 00:13:42.790
(soft music)

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.050
On a sphere, straight lines
are parts of great circles,

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:47.040
these are the circles

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.440
with the largest possible circumference.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.110
On Earth, the equator,
and circles of longitude,

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.123
are examples of great circles,

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.470
and we can use this to see
how straight lines behave.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.170
These lines seem to go
in the same direction,

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:02.760
but as you keep extending them,

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.580
you find that they intersect once,

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.550
and then again on the
other side of the earth.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:12.030
And this will always happen
for any two great circles,

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:13.530
because they must each

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:15.750
have the largest possible circumference,

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.653
so, on a sphere, there
are no parallel lines.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:24.240
Gauss had long been fascinated
by spherical geometry.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.800
He was also a geodesist,

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.860
and frequently took
measurements of the Earth.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.130
In the 1820s,

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.980
he was tasked with surveying
the Kingdom of Hanover

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.690
to help make a map.

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:34.650
As part of this survey,

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:36.960
he climbed the mountains near Gottingen.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.330
With the help of people
situated on other landmarks,

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.430
they were able to carefully
measure the angles

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:43.110
of several triangles,

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.240
which would then be used
to determine the position

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.490
of one place relative to another.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:48.930
As a reference for the survey,

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.570
and to help determine the
roundness of the Earth,

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.930
they also precisely measured
the angles of a large triangle

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:56.703
formed by three mountains.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.780
But for all of Gauss' romantic notions

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.882
of taking measurements
on top of mountains,

00:15:02.882 --> 00:15:03.715
(contemplative music)

00:15:03.715 --> 00:15:06.210
he was not the kindest correspondent.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.700
When Bolyai received his hero's response,

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.230
he was devastated,

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.300
believing that Gauss was
trying to undermine him

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.190
and steal his ideas.

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:16.710
He was so embittered by Gauss' response

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.083
that he never published again.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.460
In 1848, Bolyai had to
endure another hardship

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.410
when he found out that
Russian mathematician,

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:26.790
Nikolai Lobachevsky,

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:29.850
had independently discovered
non-Euclidean geometry,

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.310
several years before Bolyai had published

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.713
his 24 page long appendix.

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:38.250
When Bolyai died in 1860,

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:40.740
he left behind 20,000 pages

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.380
of unpublished mathematical manuscripts.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.430
He would not know

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:46.650
that Gauss did independently discover

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:48.330
non-Euclidean geometry,

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.640
nor would he know, that
upon receiving the appendix,

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.867
Gauss had written to a friend,

00:15:52.867 --> 00:15:55.440
"I regard this young geometer, Bolyai,

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.932
as a genius of the first order."

00:15:58.932 --> 00:16:01.290
(soft music)

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:03.030
While Bolyai was embittered,

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:06.360
non-Euclidean geometries
continued to develop.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.650
Until 1854, spherical geometry
wasn't actually considered

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:13.050
a non-Euclidean geometry.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:14.760
That's because, on a sphere,

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.610
lines can't be extended indefinitely.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.950
This is what earlier
mathematicians had stumbled upon,

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:21.990
and therefore dismissed this geometry,

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:25.530
since Euclid's second
postulate wouldn't hold.

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:27.120
But in 1854,

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.160
Riemann changed the second postulate

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.050
from an infinite extension

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:33.690
to something that is, quote, "unbounded,"

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.933
so that the second postulate
still holds on a sphere.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.680
With this change,
spherical geometry became

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.590
another valid non-Euclidean geometry.

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:45.930
By using the generalized four postulates,

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:48.960
and taking the fifth as there
being no parallel lines,

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.623
you could now derive spherical
or elliptic geometry.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:56.973
Would you consider the
fifth postulate a mistake?

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.570
Would it have been better if
he just never wrote that down?

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:01.740
- If he never wrote that down,

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.060
he would've stunted his geometry,

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.320
'cause he wouldn't be able to prove

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.600
a lot of things that he claimed to have.

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.270
It's beautiful that he wrote this.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.580
It's beautiful that
people spent 2,000 years

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:12.810
trying to refute him,

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.900
only to discover that,
in fact, he was right

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.270
in writing this in the first place.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.040
- [Derek] So, while Euclid was right

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.720
to write down the fifth postulate,

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.600
he did make a different mistake.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.670
- So here's the problem
with what Euclid was doing.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:30.540
Definition 1, "A point is
that which has no part."

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:31.740
What does it mean to have a part?

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.090
What is a part?

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:34.267
What does it mean not to have a part?

00:17:34.267 --> 00:17:37.350
"A line is a breadthless length."

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:38.640
What does it mean to have breadth?

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.230
Lying evenly within itself,

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:41.700
within the points on itself?

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.110
What the hell is he talking about?

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:44.820
We read this two minutes ago,

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:45.757
and we were nodding along like,

00:17:45.757 --> 00:17:48.120
"Yeah, completely makes
sense what he's saying."

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.350
It's all nonsense.

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:51.150
Don't give me a definition

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.340
that's gonna have an infinite recursion.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.320
If you give me a definition
in terms of other things,

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.880
then you have to tell me
what those things are.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.713
If you tell me what that is,

00:17:57.713 --> 00:17:59.820
you have to tell me what
the thing before it is.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.970
- Are the definitions a bad idea?

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.160
- You shouldn't have definitions,

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.170
you should have undefined terms.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.580
I'm not gonna tell you what a point is,

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.720
I'm not gonna tell you what a line is,

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.430
I'm not gonna tell you what a plane is.

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.880
All I'm gonna tell you is
what the postulates are

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.530
that they're assumed to satisfy.

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.530
It's the relationships between
the objects that's important,

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:21.990
not the definitions of
the objects themselves.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.050
And once you free your
mind to that possibility,

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:26.070
all of a sudden,

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.160
you realize that there's a
perfectly good geometric world

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.710
in which, by line, you mean great circle,

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.600
and by plane, you mean sphere,

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.540
and by point, you mean
a point on a sphere,

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.210
and then four of those
axioms are satisfied,

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:40.560
just not the fifth.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.930
And similarly, there's another model,

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.570
something called a disk
model for hyperbolic space,

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:47.283
which, the disk is the plane.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:49.950
What I mean by straight lines

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.890
is arcs of circles that
are orthogonal to the disk,

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.620
and then points are
points inside the disk.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:56.920
And the disk is the plane.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.400
- [Derek] See, you can
think of geometry as a game.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.233
(thoughtful music)

00:19:01.233 --> 00:19:02.066
The first four postulates

00:19:02.066 --> 00:19:05.250
are like the minimum rules
required to play that game,

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:06.810
and then the fifth postulate

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.720
selects the world that you'll play in.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.610
If you pick that there
are no parallel lines,

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.740
you're playing in spherical geometry.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.660
If you choose one parallel line,

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.490
you're playing in flat geometry.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.890
And if you go for more
than one parallel line,

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:22.353
then you're playing in
hyperbolic geometry.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.640
But Riemann decided to
take it one step further.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.430
Instead of selecting just
one world to play in,

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.893
why not combine them all into one?

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.910
During his inaugural speech in 1854,

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.010
he laid out the groundwork for a geometry

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:41.040
where the curvature could
differ from place to place.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.510
One part might be flat,

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:44.490
another part might be slightly curved,

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:47.820
and yet another part might
have a very strong curvature.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.710
And this geometry wouldn't be limited

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:51.780
to two-dimensional planes either,

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:55.173
it could be extended to
three or more dimensions.

00:19:56.623 --> 00:19:57.570
(contemplative music)

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.000
Another breakthrough came in 1868,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.640
when Eugenio Beltrami unequivocally proved

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.830
that hyperbolic and spherical geometry

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:08.160
were just as consistent
as Euclid's flat geometry.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.380
That is, if there were any inconsistencies

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.630
in hyperbolic or spherical geometry,

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:16.323
then they must also be present
in Euclid's flat geometry.

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:20.400
The prospects for these new
geometries were looking great.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.850
And it turns out, this
was just the beginning.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:24.683
(soft music)

00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:28.380
In 1905, Einstein proposed the
special theory of relativity,

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.780
which is based on just two postulates.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.550
One, "The laws of physics are the same

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:34.830
in all inertial frames of reference."

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.380
And two, "The speed of light in a vacuum

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.440
is the same for all inertial observers."

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:45.003
So, as a result, space
and time must be relative.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.140
But that created a problem
for Newtonian gravity,

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:50.790
because, according to Newton,

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:53.280
the force of gravity is
inversely proportional

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.070
to the distance between
the two objects squared.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.080
But in Einstein's special relativity,

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.140
that distance is no longer well-defined.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.840
In whose reference frame are we measuring?

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.020
And so Einstein had to
find a way to reconcile

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.420
relativity and gravity.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.310
Two years later, in 1907,

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:14.340
Einstein had the happiest
thought of his life,

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.280
he imagined a man falling
off the roof of a house.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.050
And what made Einstein so joyful

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:21.480
is that he realized that
while the man is falling,

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.820
he would feel absolutely weightless,

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.320
and if he let go of an object,

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.010
it would just remain in
uniform motion relative to him.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:33.210
It would be just like being
in space, not near any masses,

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:36.210
floating around in a spaceship
at constant velocity.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:39.210
And that is an inertial observer.

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.040
Now, here's the big breakthrough,

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.590
Einstein realized that
they're not just similar,

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:45.120
they are identical,

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.250
because there is no
experiment you could do

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.200
to determine whether you're in free fall

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.180
in a uniform gravitational field,

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.950
or whether you are in deep space,

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.083
not near any massive objects.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.410
And so the free-falling man too

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:00.330
must be an inertial observer,

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:02.340
meaning he is not accelerating,

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.970
and he's not experiencing
any force of gravity.

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:08.040
But if gravity is not a force,

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.300
then how do you explain things

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.550
like the space station orbiting Earth?

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:14.550
Shouldn't it just fly
off in a straight line?

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:18.000
Well, astronauts in the space
station also feel weightless.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.350
And that's the key,

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:22.380
it feels just as if they're
traveling at constant velocity

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:23.910
in a straight line.

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:25.020
It feels like that

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.570
because that's precisely
what they're doing,

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:30.030
they're traveling in a straight line.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:32.280
How, then, could that
straight line appear curved

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.170
to a distant observer?

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:35.003
The answer is,

00:22:35.003 --> 00:22:38.913
because the space time that
straight line is on is curved.

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.440
See, massive objects curve spacetime,

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.510
and objects moving
through curved spacetime

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:48.780
will follow the shortest path
through that curved geometry,

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.070
the geodesic.

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:51.810
So, while astronauts in the space station

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.460
are following a straight line,

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.710
it appears curved to a distant observer

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:58.953
because the Earth curves
the spacetime around it.

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:03.900
So, the behavior of straight
lines in curved geometries

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:07.170
is core to understanding
the universe we live in.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.810
And in the more than a hundred
years since it was published,

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:11.400
the general theory of relativity

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.481
has been remarkably successful.

00:23:14.481 --> 00:23:15.314
(soft music)

00:23:15.314 --> 00:23:18.690
In 2014, astronomers briefly
observed a supernova,

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:22.170
a violent and extremely
bright death of a star.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.300
In fact, they saw the exact same supernova

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.520
in four different places.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.480
How?

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.610
Well, in between the supernova and earth,

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:33.060
there was a massive galaxy,
which curved space time,

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.440
so light from the supernova,

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.510
which was spreading out in all directions,

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.330
had several different
paths to reach the earth,

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:40.830
and four of those reached Earth

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.780
at approximately the same time.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:47.220
The galaxy had functioned as
a massive gravitational lens.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:50.250
The astronomers realized that
other galaxies in the cluster

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:53.160
might also lens the light
from that supernova,

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.750
but with different path lengths

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.400
and gravitational potentials,

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.000
so the light would reach
earth at different times.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.500
After careful modeling,

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.960
they predicted that
they should see a replay

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.573
of that supernova just a year later.

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:10.020
And on the 11th of December, 2015,

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:14.163
just as predicted, they saw
the same supernova once more.

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:17.940
In addition to being able
to observe the effects

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:19.290
of curved spacetime,

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:22.590
we can now even measure the
ripples of space time itself,

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:25.230
gravitational waves
formed by cosmic events,

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:27.000
far, far away,

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.983
like the merger of black holes.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.910
And according to a recent
survey by NANOGrav,

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:35.400
the fabric of spacetime
seems to be buzzing

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.880
with the remnants of grand cosmic events.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.760
In the hundred years since
general relativity was published,

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.310
countless findings have
supported its predictions,

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:47.610
and at its very core are
the curved geometries

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.980
of Bolyai and Riemann.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.080
But so far, all the
effects we've looked at

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.753
are local distortions of spacetime.

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:58.303
What is the shape of the entire universe?

00:24:58.303 --> 00:25:00.055
(stars whooshing)

00:25:00.055 --> 00:25:00.888
(contemplative music)

00:25:00.888 --> 00:25:02.790
Using the differences
between the geometries,

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.920
we can find that out too.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.090
In flat geometry,

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:08.160
we expect all the angles of a triangle

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.160
to add up to 180 degrees without fail.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.720
But in spherical geometry,

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.530
the angles don't add up to
180 degrees, but to more.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:18.390
Similarly in hyperbolic geometry,

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:21.660
the angles add up to
less than 180 degrees.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:24.180
So, to determine the
shape of the universe,

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:27.480
you just need to measure
the angles of a triangle.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.360
And measuring a triangle is
precisely what Gauss was doing

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.830
200 years ago.

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.990
In fact, this led some to speculate

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:35.970
that he was actually trying
to measure the curvature

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:37.950
of space itself.

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:39.780
The angle he found,

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.573
180 degrees, within observational error.

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:46.170
But that shouldn't be very surprising.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:49.830
Take this balloon, for example,
which approximates a sphere.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:52.500
If I draw a small triangle on it,

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.290
well, the surface I'm
drawing on is basically flat,

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:56.790
so the angles inside the triangle

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:59.700
will add up to essentially 180 degrees.

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.850
Only if I make the triangle large enough

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:05.970
will the effects of
curvature come into play,

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:07.620
and then the angles in the triangle

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.110
will add up to more than 180 degrees.

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:12.174
And this was the problem
with Gauss' experiment,

00:26:12.174 --> 00:26:14.850
even if he was trying
to measure the curvature

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:18.240
of space itself, for which
there is no solid evidence,

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.240
the triangle he measured
would've been far too small

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.472
relative to the size of the universe.

00:26:24.472 --> 00:26:25.305
(ball thudding)

00:26:25.305 --> 00:26:26.138
(soft music)

00:26:26.138 --> 00:26:28.170
So, in order to overcome the scale issue

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:29.460
that Gauss encountered,

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.220
we need to scale the triangles
formed between mountains

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:34.860
up to the largest triangles we can.

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.050
And since looking further and further away

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:39.540
is the same as looking
further back in time,

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.390
we need to look back as far as possible,

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:45.210
to the very first light we can see,

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:48.420
the Cosmic Microwave Background, or CMB,

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:52.923
a picture from when the universe
was just 380,000 years old.

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:56.640
While the CMB is almost
completely uniform,

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.300
there are some spots that are
slightly hotter or colder.

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.910
Now, we know how far away the CMB is,

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:06.060
so if we can figure out
how large such a spot is,

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.570
then we can draw a cosmic triangle.

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:11.280
It's thought that the first density

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.510
and temperature variations

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:14.910
originated from quantum fluctuations

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:16.560
in the very early universe,

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.590
which were then blown up
as the universe expanded.

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:21.570
But due to this rapid expansion,

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:25.590
not all regions were in causal
contact with each other.

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:27.570
So, using the information we have

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:29.520
of how the early universe evolved,

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.150
astronomers can predict how
often spots of different sizes

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:35.790
should appear in the CMB.

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:38.520
This is what this power spectrum shows,

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.920
essentially a histogram of how often

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:45.000
each spot size should occur
if the universe is flat.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.390
So now we have something to
compare our measurement to.

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:49.740
If the universe is flat,

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.120
the angle we measure on the sky

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.550
should be the same as we'd expect.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:55.770
But if the universe is
curved like a sphere,

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:57.600
the angles of the triangle should add up

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.000
to more than 180 degrees,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.300
so the angle we'd measure
would be larger than predicted,

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.880
and this peak would shift to the left.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.030
Similarly, if the universe
has hyperbolic geometry,

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:11.700
then spots should appear
smaller than predicted,

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.520
and this peak would shift to the right.

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.500
So, what do we measure?

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.240
This is the data from the Plank mission,

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.610
which is almost exactly what you'd expect

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:22.530
if the universe were flat.

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:24.960
This mission also gives us
the current best estimate

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.490
for the curvature of the universe,

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:31.490
which is 0.0007, plus minus 0.0019.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:35.730
So that's basically zero
within the margin of error.

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:37.020
So we're fairly certain

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.453
that the universe we live in is flat.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.590
But living in a flat universe

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:45.531
seems to be remarkably serendipitous.

00:28:45.531 --> 00:28:46.364
(contemplative music)

00:28:46.364 --> 00:28:48.180
Right now, the average mass energy density

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:50.940
comes down to the equivalent
of about six hydrogen atoms

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:51.963
per cubic meter.

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:55.860
If, on average, that was
just one more hydrogen atom,

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.680
the universe would've been
more spherically curved.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.330
If there were just one less,

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:03.090
the curvature would be
hyperbolic geometry.

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:05.790
And so far, we're not
entirely sure why the universe

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:07.863
has the mass energy density it has.

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.370
What we do know is that general relativity

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:14.070
is one of our best physical
theories of reality,

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:15.750
and at the very heart of it,

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:19.830
are those paradoxical and
seemingly absurd geometries,

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:23.790
ones we found because mathematicians
spent over 2,000 years

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:25.830
thinking about a single sentence

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:28.973
from the world's most famous math text.

00:29:28.973 --> 00:29:32.056
(high-tech blooping)

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:35.130
When it comes to human brilliance,

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:36.930
it's not just what you know,

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:38.700
it's also how you think,

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.130
and a great way to improve how you think

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:44.190
is by building your knowledge
and problem solving skills.
