00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:07.960
\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hi, and welcome to Veritasium,
an online science video blog. I'd like to

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:15.230
take on scientific topics all the way from
the simplest to the most complex. So a good

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.269
place to start, I think, is with a problem
considered by the famous physicist Richard

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:28.899
Feynmann. He asked, "If all the world's scientific
information except for one sentence were destroyed

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:36.510
in some cataclysmic event, which single statement
would contain the most scientific information

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:46.309
for future generations?" His conclusion was
that it is The Atomic Hypothesis. [Music]

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:52.600
The atomic hypothesis states that all things
are made up of atoms, tiny particles that

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.289
are in perpetual motion; they attract each
other when a little distance apart but repel

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:05.820
if squeezed together. That statement is incredibly
important to understand if you want to understand

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.490
most of the rest of science, because everything
is made of atoms, including you and me and

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.840
the Opera House, and the Harbour Bridge, and
the water, and the trees, and the grass, and

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.100
the air and the clouds, and, well, you get
the idea. Everything is made out of atoms,

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.430
so it's really important to understand the
atomic concept if you're going to understand

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.780
the rest of science. The idea that everything
is made out of tiny particles has been around

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.670
for thousands of years. The oldest recorded
texts are in Greece and India. In fact the

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.920
word atom comes from the Greek atomos, meaning
literally, uncuttable. So the idea that they

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:55.320
had was if you took a piece of matter, like
this piece of aluminium foil, you could cut

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:05.729
it in half
and in half again each time reducing the number

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.860
of atoms by half. But the idea was you could
not go on doing that indefinitely, for there

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:21.160
would come a point when you have only a single
atom left and it is uncuttable, it's an atom.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.740
How many times do you think I could cut this
A4 sheet of aluminium in half before I reach

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.520
a single atom?}
