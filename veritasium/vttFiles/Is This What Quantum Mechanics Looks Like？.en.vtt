00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960
Check this out

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.800
I'm using this speaker to vibrate a petri dish containing silicon oil

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.980
Now if I take this toothpick and make a little droplet on the surface

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.980
the droplet will stay there, hovering above the surface

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.880
The droplet is actually bouncing

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.800
and it will keep bouncing for a very long time

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.080
Now the reason for this is a little layer of air between the droplet and the surface

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.600
And the droplets bouncing so rapidly that that layer never shrinks to about 100 nanometers

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.040
Which is what it would take for the droplet to recombine with the oil

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.420
Now, every time the droplet lands on the surface, it creates a wave

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.820
But this is a special type of wave

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.460
Driven by the vibration of the oil bath

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.520
It is a standing wave

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.340
Meaning that it is not traveling out

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.720
It's just oscillating up and down

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.160
So the droplet makes the wave

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.100
And then it interacts with that wave on its next bounce

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.840
If the drop lands on one side of the wave, it is pushed forwards

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.240
And as long as the bounce of the droplet remains synchronized with the wave

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.280
It will keep landing on the front side of the wave getting pushed farther forwards

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.540
Droplets like these are known as "Walkers"

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.420
The bouncing oil drops has been known about since the 1970s

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.080
But only recently has it been discovered that you can use these little droplets

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.720
to replicate many of the strange phenomena of quantum mechanics

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.840
Now obviously this is not a quantum system, the droplets are about a millimeter in diameter

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.440
But you can think of the droplets like, uh, quantum particles, say electrons

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.780
One experiment that captures the key features of quantum mechanics is the Double-Slit Experiment

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.380
If you send a beam of electrons at two narrow slits

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.480
Well, the electrons, rather than behaving like particles and ending up in two clumps behind the slits

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.240
They produce an interference pattern

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.000
Even when you send each electron through one at a time

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.120
With Walking droplets, the pilot wave goes through both slits

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.720
Interfering with itself, while the droplet only goes through one slit

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.480
The droplet does move in a straight line though

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.260
It's deflected by its interaction with the wave

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.040
The resulting distribution of where the droplets end up

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.840
Looks very similar to quantum double-slit interference patterns

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.060
Or take tunneling

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.940
In quantum mechanics, it's possible for a particle to get through a barrier

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.060
that it wouldn't classically have enough energy to get over

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.220
This has been demonstrated with Walkers by

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.880
creating a shallow barrier under the surface of the oil

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.340
Usually the barrier reflects the pilot wave and its bouncing droplet

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.680
But in rare cases, the droplet does cross the boundary

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.820
And the probability of the droplet crossing the barrier

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.300
Decreases exponentially with increasing width of the barrier, just as in quantum tunneling

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.220
Perhaps the most surprising thing about these Walkers is they exhibit quantization, just like electrons bound to atoms

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.900
Here the Walker is confined to a circular corral

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.800
The droplet seems to move around randomly as it interacts with its pilot wave

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.180
The complex interaction between the droplet and the wave leads to chaotic motion of the droplet

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.980
But over time, a pattern builds up

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.260
This is the probability density of finding the droplet at any point within

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.380
the corral and it looks very similar to

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.180
the probability density of electrons

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.500
confined in a quantum corral

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.160
all of these similarities are no coincidence

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.290
the walking droplets actually create a

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.359
remarkable physical realization of a

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.310
theory proposed by de Broglie nearly a

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.319
hundred years ago in the early days of

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.720
quantum mechanics he postulated that all

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.030
particles have a wave that accompanies

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.280
them and guides their motion and that

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.200
wave is actually created by tiny

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.960
oscillations of the particle

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.880
Now this pilot wave theory was marginalized when

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.319
the standard Copenhagen interpretation

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.579
became widely adopted

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.920
the Copenhagen interpretation excludes anything that

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.600
cannot be directly observed and it says

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.160
everything that can be known about a

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.139
particle is contained in its so-called

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.109
"Wave Function" but adopting this view

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.810
forces you to give up on some common

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.190
sense notions like the idea that

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.350
particles have a definite position and

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.430
momentum even when they're not being measured

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.160
and it also meant that the

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.180
universe was

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.480
no longer deterministic

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.700
randomness is built into standard quantum mechanics

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.089
for example take the double-slit experiment

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.510
according to quantum mechanics the wave

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.950
function of the electron is a

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.569
superposition of the electron going

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.469
through one slit and the other slip simultaneously

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.560
using this wave function you can calculate the probability of

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.590
where the electron is likely to be and

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.600
then when you detected at the screen the

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.120
electron pops up at one point at random

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.490
that was in that distribution we say

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.960
that its wave function collapses

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.090
instantaneously at the moment of

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.130
measurement you can't say that the

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.020
electron was there before you measured

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.400
it and you can't even say that the

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.110
electron must have gone through one slit

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.370
or the other

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.570
compare that with the picture provided

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.729
by the bouncing droplets in this case

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.320
the pilot wave goes through both slits

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.419
but the droplet only goes through one

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.639
the droplet is pushed around by its

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.169
interaction with the wave so that the

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:56.970
resulting statistical distribution is

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.610
the same the droplet never exists in two

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.099
places at once and there's no randomness

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.349
if there is any uncertainty it's just

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.690
due to our ignorance of what's going on

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.360
it's not that it doesn't exist so pilot

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.849
wave dynamics can produce many of the

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:14.789
same results as quantum mechanics does

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:17.520
this mean that this is really what

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.990
quantum particles are doing

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.229
no but I think it'll at least suggest

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.599
that this is possible these are possible

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:25.830
dynamics that could lead to the

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.870
statistics which are captured in the

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.669
quantum mechanical theory and what's

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.740
appealing about this is it gives you a

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.930
clear idea of what's going on you don't

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.460
have to abandon the idea that the

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.139
universe is deterministic and you get

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.960
particles with definite position and momenta.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.440
I think it's great that we have

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.000
two competing theories for the same

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.880
experiments and they both asked you to

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.430
accept odd things just different odd

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.500
things and it comes down to what you're

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.060
comfortable with really whether you

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.040
prefer the Copenhagen interpretation is standard quantum mechanics

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.780
or a pilot wave theory

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.860
let me know what you think in the

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.960
comments do you like the pilot waves I

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.729
mean it's definitely a very appealing

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.039
picture whether or not correspond to

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:11.260
reality that remains to be seen

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.880
Hey this episode of Veritasium was supported in part by viewers like you on Patreon

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.740
and by Google's Making &amp; Science Initiative which seeks to

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.130
inspire people to learn more about

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.070
science and pursue their science goals

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.840
now I know someone else who is pursuing

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.190
their science goals this weekend that is

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.410
Destin over it Smarter Every Day he

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.970
and I were looking at basically the same

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.160
phenomenon but he was looking at water

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.200
droplets and why they don't 
coalesce so

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.970
if you want to see how that works and

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.520
how it works in space go check it out on

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.260
his channel over at Smarter Every Day

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.600
and as always thanks for watching

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.760
looking at only one frame per bounce you

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.420
can see how the droplets motion is

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.190
guided by the wave it's effectively

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.220
surfing on and the wave remains even if

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.170
the droplet disappears has happened

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:00.880
sometimes if it encounters a little bit

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.660
of dirt

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.670
what's really cool about this is the

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.010
wave actually stores information about

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.790
where the droplet has been.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.560
This is because every time the droplet bounces

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.060
it creates a new circular wave centered

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.280
on its present location and that wave

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.500
adds to the existing wavefield on the

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.110
surface so as the droplet moves the

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.810
waves it makes keep adding up, storing

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.670
the information of where it's been

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.080
in fact you can actually get the droplet

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.240
to land on the backside of the wave so

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.370
now it's pushed backwards and it

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.310
retraces it steps erasing each way that

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:37.000
made previously one-at-a-time
