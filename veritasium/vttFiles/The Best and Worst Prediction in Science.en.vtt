00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.420
How much energy is there in empty space ?

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.120
We believe there is 10 to the minus 8th ergs in every cubic centimeter of empty space

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.260
How much is an "erg" ?

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.020
It's a very small amount, you know if a... If a mosquito flaps its wings, or a fly I guess

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.740
flaps its wings, it's about 1 ergs worth of energy.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.200
So an erg is not very much

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.160
Uhh, we're talking about a hundred millionth of an erg in every cubic centimeter of space

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.120
Now, it might seem strange that completely empty space contains energy, but

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.300
there are 2 good reasons why scientists think this is the case.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.840
One is because the expansion of the universe is speeding up

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.040
and that's thought to be caused by dark energy,

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.140
which fills all space and makes gravity repulsive.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.660
We always think that gravity always pulls, but according to Einstein

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.060
the way gravity works really depends on the material itself and

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.580
energy tied to space, gravity pushes, it doesn't pull.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.420
If that number is 10 to the minus 8th ergs, per cubic centimeter

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.700
Then you fit the data, then that's the dark energy that makes universe accelerate

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.700
It's constant, does everything you want.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.540
The second reason why empty space contains energy

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.640
is because it isn't really "empty".

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.020
There is the idea that, thanks to quantum mechanics,

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.620
we do expect particles to come in and out of existence, and so

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.300
space is full of energy

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.820
Yeah, there was nothing there when we first looked and nothing there when we later looked

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.120
Could we say for sure, if we had looked in the middle

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.480
that there weren't particles there ?

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.980
No, there might have been

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.800
Evidence for these so-called "virtual particles" came from studying the light emitted by energized hydrogen atoms.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.740
Niels Bohr first used the particular colors of light to divise his quantum model of the atom.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.060
where the electron orbits the nucleus in certain allowed orbits, each with its own specific energy.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.220
When the electron jumps from a higher-energy orbit to a lower one, it gives off light

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.160
and the energy enhanced color of that light is determined by the energy difference between the two levels.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.560
As quantum theory developed, Bohr's orbits were superseded by probablistic electron clouds,

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.760
but the energy levels remained mostly unchanged.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.460
Then, in 1947, Willis Lamb and his grad student Robert Retherford

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.780
attempted to test the best version of quantum theory at the time, which was the Dirac equation.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.320
And they did this by measuring the energy levels in hydrogen more precisely than ever before.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.580
Now, what they found did not match up with the theory.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.160
One of the energy levels was actually not one, but rather two, very closely spaced energy levels.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.560
And this is known as the Lamb shift.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.620
They used microwaves to excite the electron between these two levels.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.720
So, why were there two energy levels where there was supposed to be just one ?

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.200
Well, the answer is Virtual Particles.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.400
For example around the proton virtual electron-positron pairs pop in and out of existence.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.060
This is permitted by the laws of Quantum Mechanics so long as they don't stick around for too long.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.480
During their brief lives the negative electron is attracted to the positive proton while the positron is repelled away from it.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.080
This means the charge of the proton is shielded by the  virtual electrons surrounding it.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.120
This affects the energy of the 2s orbital - in which the electron is closer to the nucleus -

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.120
differently from the 2p orbital, and that's what causes the energy levels to split.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.260
And this is just one contribution to the energy difference.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.820
The full calculation involves drawing a series of Feynman diagrams

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.980
that show all the possible interactions between real and virtual particles

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.480
and adding up the contribution from each one.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.380
And there's an infinite chain of these different diagrams.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.720
So you might worry that you can predict nothing at all

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.480
because you'd need to add up an infinite number of numbers to get the right answer.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.140
But the point is that every time you have these two... vertices

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.360
these two places where the photon hits the electron

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.440
that's associated with a number alpha, the fine-structure constant, which is 1/137, which is a small number.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.560
So,  this leading term, this classical contribution is already small

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.400
and these more-complicated ones, you notice there are more vertices up here

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.300
and as the diagrams get more and more complicated there are more and more of these terms

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.260
so you get alpha squared; alpha cubed; alpha to the fourth, and the numbers become smaller and smaller and smaller

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.960
so the more complicated diagrams

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.320
the more intricate effects of the virtual particles become less and less important.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.160
Using the Dirac equation, but adding in the effects of virtual electrons, positrons, and photons

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.240
we can actually calculate the values of atomic parameters with better accuracy than 1 part in a billion.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:36.820
That is incredible. In fact, physicists Lawrence Krauss calls it: "The best and most accurate prediction in all of science."

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.780
So with the spectacular usefulness of virtual particles

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.340
You think it would be pretty hard for anyone to doubt their existence,

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.000
But then again, they have never been directly observed.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.520
In fact, theoretically, that's impossible.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:05:01.740
Explaining virtual particles is always tricky, because it's very hard to think of them in any sort of real way.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.240
They can go in the opposite direction of their momenta, and... and...

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.840
And do these things which are not consistent with... with a real particle.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.320
So virtual particles have a strange sort of existence.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.260
Where they're indispensable for calculations, obviously,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.840
but you can never directly observe them.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:26.400
But maybe this is not actually a real problem, it's just the result of thinking about reality in the wrong way.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.760
Maybe as the fundamental building blocks of our universe, we shouldn't be talking about particles at all;

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.580
but rather, "fields."

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:41.620
The truth is that Quantum Field Theory is, according to our best current modern understanding, the right way to talk about nature at a fundamental level.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.140
Uh... When we talk about particle physics, when we talk about electrons and gluons and quarks...

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:54.420
To the modern physicist, these are vibrations in fields. In exactly the same way the photon is a vibration in the elctromagnetic field.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.340
Just like there is an electromagnetic field, there is also:

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.080
an electron field,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.780
there's a neutrino field,

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.840
there's and up-quark field,

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.880
and a top-quark field,

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.820
et caetera.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:10.740
And these fields fill space, and usually they're just sitting there, fairly quietly, but when they vibrate, and you look at it, you see that in terms of individual particles.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.460
In this picture, virtual particles are quantum fluctuations.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.900
Little disturbances in the field.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.740
They play a role in interactions,

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.740
but they aren't measurable as 'real particles,' themselves.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.760
And since they exist everywhere,

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.140
they should imbue the vacuum with energy.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:31.000
If you were to try to estimate the amount of energy due to the virtual particles in empty space,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.660
what kind of number do you get for the energy of empty space?

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.320
Yeah, this is a huge problem,

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.460
because the 'back-of-the-envelope' estimate says there should be about 10^112 erg for every cubic centimeter.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.560
Compared to the 10^-8 that we actually get.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:51.640
In other words, you predict 10^120 times the energy density of empty space that you actually observe.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:57.800
So obviously your 'back-of-the-envelope' calculation is wildly, wildly incorrect and no one is really quite sure why.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.480
The way we said the universe responding to the cosmological constant the way we expect the vacuum to behave

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.500
are the most discrepants things we have in physics,

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.840
if they are the same things.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:16.280
How is it possible that both the best and the worst prediction in science are both based on the same underlying physics of virtual particles?

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.340
I mean, one experiment seems to show that the theory is perfectly correct,

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.080
while another shows that we could not be more wrong.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:30.960
You know, there are a lot of areas of human endeavor where we fear being so wildly incorrect,

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.260
but in science, this discrepancy is actually really exciting.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.940
Because it shows us a piece of the puzzle that we haven't figured out just yet.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:44.400
That we have to solve this problem if we are to fully understand the universe.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:50.740
And in that way, this is the best clue we have at the work that still needs to be done.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.440
So...yeah.We don't know.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.020
But that's always good! It's always good to say you don't know, right?

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.600
I think so!

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:05.120
