00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:08.090
Here are some facts about great white sharks:
white sharks are live-birthed, usually in

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.760
litters of between four and seven individuals.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:17.870
Now they're called pups, but when they're
born they're between 1.2 and 1.5 meters!

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.630
So that's a pretty big baby.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.210
It takes a great white shark about ten to
twelve years to reach maturity at which point

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.950
the females are actually about a meter longer
than the males - the largest recorded being

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.900
over six meters - roughly the size of this
red boat behind me.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.100
At this length they'd weigh about two to three
thousand kilograms.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.050
Oh man!

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.820
Now there are stories of some great whites
being over seven meters but those are unsubstantiated.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.820
White sharks are warm bodied.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.140
They're not warm-blooded like us - they can't
maintain a perfectly stable temperature, but

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.640
their internal organs are kept at up to thirteen
degrees above the average temperature of the

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.540
ambient water around them.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.580
The heat generated by their muscles is actually
transferred to the blood in their veins as

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.940
it returns from the shark's extremities, so
it warms it up and keeps the core temperature

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.170
a little bit hotter.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.100
This allows the shark to venture into colder
waters and also to have explosive power.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.580
Its muscles work a lot better when warm than
when cold, just like ours.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.390
The tradeoff is the shark requires about ten
times as much energy as if it didn't heat

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.900
its body and that's why they need to feed
on these blubber-rich seals and whale carcasses.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.799
White sharks like to hunt when it's light
out because they use their eyesight to spot

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.180
their prey.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.250
But when they open their jaws, their eyes
actually roll back into their head to protect

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.500
them and so they're actually blind when they're
taking a bite.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.810
Now they do like conditions that are a little
low visibility because they rely on stealth

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.990
to track down their prey.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.780
If a seal spots them coming, it's basically
game over because the seal is so much more

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.890
maneuverable and it can definitely get away
from the shark.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.110
But they only eat sea mammals after they're
about 2.5 meters long, which is why most of

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.019
the sharks we're seeing around here are quite
large.

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.430
Before that, they're diet consists mainly
of fish.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.900
The gestation period is thought to be about
eighteen months and that leads to a two to

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.180
three year reproduction cycle and with such
small litters that means it takes a long time

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.269
for this shark population to recover.

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.989
There are a couple misconceptions about great
white sharks.

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.389
One is that they can't get cancer and that's
led to a lot of people hunting them down and

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.760
trying to use their fins as an anti-cancer
soup.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.749
But in reality sharks get cancer just like
anything else and there is photographic evidence

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:46.489
of sharks with big tumors so it makes no sense
to hunt down sharks as a cancer remedy because

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.709
they get cancer just like we do.

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.150
Another misconception is sharks are coastal
creatures that just cruise the beaches waiting

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.559
to bite people.

00:02:56.559 --> 00:03:01.639
In reality the sharks spend much of their
time way, way out at sea and very deep, over

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.359
a kilometer deep.

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.659
It's kind of shocking but we've only found
this out in the last couple of years so there

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.840
is so much about sharks that remains undiscovered.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.230
We don't know where they go or what they do
for most of the time that they're alive.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.130
That's why research projects like this are
so important to find out more about the shark

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.409
and figure out how we can help it rehabilitate
and become the predator of the sea that it

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:28.009
once was.
