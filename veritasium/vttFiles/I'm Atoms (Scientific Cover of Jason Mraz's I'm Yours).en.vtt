00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.500
Well an atom's made of protons, neutrons, and electrons

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.500
the first two in the nucleus, the third around it

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.500
it's mostly empty space, but it feels solid in any case

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.500
The elements are all the different types of atoms

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.600
they differ by the number of protons in the middle.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.000
Hydrogen has only one,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.400
but Uranium has a ton

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's just chemistry 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that you and me

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.500
are made of these atoms

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.700
Well atoms bond together to form molecules

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.600
Most of what's surrounding me and you

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.600
Water, sugar, things yet undreamed of of of of

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.500
Look around you, see the combinations in a eucalypt tree

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.500
Mendeleev's periodicity

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.400
gives us sand and water and the air above ove ove ove ove

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.600
It's just chemistry

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.600
that you and me

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.500
are made of these atoms:

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:54.600
Hydrogen, Ox-y-gen, Carbon, Nitrogen,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.600
make up the world's life forms

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.800
Do do do you, do do do do

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.000
but do you wonder how

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.500
matter forms something strange

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.000
when there's a chemical change?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.500
Where did these atoms come from? They were fused in stars

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.500
Light elements combine releasing light from afar

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Fusion in the sun,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.600
creates Helium

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.500
I guess what I be saying is you gotta use your reason

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.600
To open up your mind and see the cause of the seasons

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.500
How do we know what's true?

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.500
The scientific method shows you

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.500
It's just chemistry

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.800
that you and me

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.500
are made of these atoms

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.500
Atoms bond together to form molecules

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.600
Most of what's surrounding me and you

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.600
Water, sugar, sand and you'll find things undreamed of

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.600
Argon, Neon, Xenon

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.800
There's no need to overstate

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.600
'Cause we are of course

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:32.000
This, of this, of this, we're made: atoms
