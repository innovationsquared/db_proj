00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.460
Come take a walk with me, around Longyearbyen.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.440
That's the largest town on the Norwegian islands of Svalbard.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.640
Parts of it may look familiar.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.960
But make no mistake,

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.340
this place IS different.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.740
At 78Â° north,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.140
It is just 1800mi/1300km from the North Pole.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.660
And with over 2000 permanent residents,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.340
it is the northernmost real town on Earth.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.480
There are only 50km (31mi) of road, including the small streets between houses.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.220
So people get around the island mainly on snowmobile.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.720
In fact, there are more registered snowmobiles, than residents.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.060
Anyone leaving town is required to travel with a gun and someone who knows how to use it.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.900
Because the islands are also home to polar bears.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.580
The average daytime high,

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.520
is below freezing for all but four months of the year.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.480
Hi.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.360
And from the end of October to mid February,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.200
the sun doesn't rise at all.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.420
This is the long polar night.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.320
Living here, is tough.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.440
This past December, an avalanche in town destroyed 10 homes,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.700
which used to be here, killing two people.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.640
So how did this cold, remote, ice-covered archipelago come to be inhabited?

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.040
Well, the hills around town are rich in coal deposits,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.380
that have been mined for over 100 years.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.480
The coal was transported to the port via a series of aerial tramways.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.120
Some of which remain today, though they are no longer operational.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.780
Coal is a reminder that Svalbard was not always an Arctic ice world.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.300
360 million yaers ago it was actually in the tropics, just north of the equator.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.440
A swampy area it was covered with a precursor to modern ferns,

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.920
which were much larger than they are today, reaching 10-30m (33-98ft) in height.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.820
This vegetation was then covered in mud and sand,

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.020
and submerged under the sea.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.400
Over time, it turned into the coal deposites that in the 20th century

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.100
brought miners from Norway, Russia and the US.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.600
Most of the coal mines have now closed and the economy

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.640
is gradually shifting towards tourism, education and research.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.220
Tourists take trips on snowmobiles and dog sleds.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.600
There is a university center in Svalbard which offers semester courses

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.940
in biology, physics and geology.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.980
And up on the side of a mountain, is the Svalbard Global Seed Vault.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.980
But that's a story for another time.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.720
The locals tell me that interest in the region from different nations

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.860
is increasing.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.820
As the globe warms and Arctic ice shrinks

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.340
trade routs are opening up across the north.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.720
And Svalbard is strategically placed between North America, Asia and Europe.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:02.540
So one day in the future, Svaldbard may no longer be as cold or as remote as it once was.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:16.460
But for now, it is a reminder of how through our ingenuity people can live

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.020
in even the most inhospitable of places.
