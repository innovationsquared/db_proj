00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Go!!

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
1,2,3 a song about 'lectricty

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
because it powers our lives,
makes it possible for us to thrive

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
because it powers our lives,
makes it possible for us to thrive

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Oh, 4, 5, 6, volts of potential difference

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
makes electrons go round
if the circuit is complete and sound

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Circuit's closed

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Voltage There

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Current Flows

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Power Everywhere

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We use AC, in factories

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and homes because we can transform it

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
High voltage transmits with lower loss

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
but low voltage is best for safety

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I said what is electricity?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Well, so 1,2,3 a song about 'lectricty

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
because it powers our lives
makes it possible for us to thrive

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
because it powers our lives
makes it possible for us to thrive

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Oh, 4, 5, 6, volts of potential difference

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
makes electrons go round
if the circuit is complete and sound

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Heat makes steam

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
turns turbines and a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
magnet in

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
coils of wires

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
We use AC in factories

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and homes because we can transform it

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
High voltage transmits with lower loss

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
but low voltage is best for safety

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I said what is electricity?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Oh yeah,

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.000
Oh yeah,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
C'mon!

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
How'd it be

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
no energy

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
of the electrical persuasion

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I know we'd have no computers

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
no internet or mobile phones yeah

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Powers the world

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Makes the world

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
We need electricity yeah
