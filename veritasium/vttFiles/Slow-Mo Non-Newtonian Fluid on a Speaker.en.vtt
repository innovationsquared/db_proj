00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.480
So today I am going to do everyone’s favorite
non Newtonian experiment.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.590
I am going to put this corn starch and water
solution on this speaker, but I want to do

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.670
this scientifically.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.841
So I am shooting it with a high speed camera
and I am going to vary the frequency and the

00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:25.600
amplitude and see what factors really give
us the best corn starch monster.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.350
It still very much looks like a liquid at
this point, but as I increase the amplitude,

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.720
you can kind of tell that it is not moving
as smoothing as it should anymore.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:50.079
You can see at this amplitude it starts to
jump around a little bit.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:58.340
Now 
I want to try to increase the frequency and

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.290
see what effect that has.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.350
You are now at about 20 hertz, which is the
frequency recommended by some scientific papers

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.590
that have studied this phenomenon.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:24.009
I’ll up the amplitude a little bit.

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.009
That is incredible.

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:31.450
That is awesome.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:48.479
Now I am going up to about 22 hertz, seeing
nicer structures.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.500
But it is really tough to tell, because it
is somewhat random.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.100
Sometimes it just turns into a blob like that
and other times you get some really cool things

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.100
forming.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.320
I am about 34 hertz here and we are not seeing
a lot of structure.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.500
It seems like at these higher frequencies
it just sort of turns into a blob.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.489
Interesting how it becomes more coherent and
smoother actually at the higher frequencies.

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.280
Wow.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.849
That’s interesting.

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:35.709
In the high speed you can clearly see that
the inertia of the thing is keeping it off

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.760
the speaker entirely.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.760
That is really cool.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.010
So it is just getting kind of bumped with
that frequency.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.650
It is not really sticking around.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.630
That this why you probably need a lower frequency.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.230
Oh.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:05:05.500
Well, that is the end of that.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.800
So how do non Newtonian fluids work?

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.990
Well, the corn starch and water is really
a suspension.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.050
That is, these tiny little grains of starch
suspended in water.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.580
So when you try to move that fluid slowly
the starch has time to get out of the way

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.870
of each other, because it is lubricated by
all those water molecules in between.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.050
But if you try to get it to go fast—and
that is, there is a lot of sheer, which means

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.840
there are some places that are going faster
than others—well, then all of the starch

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.120
grains kind of get stuck up against each other.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.639
And they can’t flow past each other.

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.889
So at that point it becomes like a solid and
less like a liquid.

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:43.210
You know, this kind of reminds me of traffic
in LA where I have been recently.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.180
If there are not that many cars on the road
it is basically like having a small amount

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.050
of starch particles in your water and everything
flows very smoothly, but as soon as you get

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.260
to rush hour and you have some cars which
are trying to floor I down the highway, plus

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.170
there is all of these cars, which are like
our starch particles, on the high way, then

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.210
suddenly everything gets clogged and you are
basically in what is a solid.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.319
So traffic might be an example of something
that is an non Newtonian fluid.

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:12.009
It flows very well when there aren’t very
many particles or when it is going quite slowly,

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:17.039
but as you try to increase the number of cars
and go really fast, then everything kind of

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:17.710
gets clogged up.
