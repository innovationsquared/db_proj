00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.430
Do you think there is life beyond the earth?

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.889
&gt;&gt; Yes, I do.

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.349
&gt;&gt; Why is that?

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:14.809
&gt;&gt; Scientifically been proven?

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.209
&gt;&gt; Are we alone?

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.990
Or is there life elsewhere in the universe?

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.470
This is a question humans have wondered about
for millennia and one that people still have

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.650
pretty strong opinions about even though there
isn’t definitive evidence to answer the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.899
question one way or the other.

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:36.710
&gt;&gt; Do you think that aliens have ever come
to earth?

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.720
&gt;&gt; People say that there is like... there
has been aliens and they implant...

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.420
I forget what it is called, but they have
like made these fields and they have like

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.239
produced something on earth.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.730
&gt;&gt; I think Area 51 could be possible and could
be real.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.740
&gt;&gt; You know how there is area 51 and all that
kind of stuff.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.800
I reckon they have got technology that they
won’t bring it out yet, you know.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.940
&gt;&gt; Do you think it is technology that came
from aliens?

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.010
&gt;&gt; Well, possibly.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.010
They could have.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.710
They could be sharing information and gaining
technology from aliens.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.450
&gt;&gt; On YouTube there seems to be some pretty
good evidence about it, but I don’t know.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.070
&gt;&gt; You have seen some videos of aliens.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.070
&gt;&gt; That looked convincing.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.070
&gt;&gt; Kind of, yeah.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.060
&gt;&gt; So {?} apparently were beings that came
down from heaven according to the old Sumerian

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.060
texts.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.920
&gt;&gt; The oil paintings and stuff and Sumeria.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.350
&gt;&gt; I think people believe that aliens have
visited us just because they are not aware

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.909
of how vast the universe really is.

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.560
I mean, what is an exoplanet?

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.840
How far is a light year?

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.609
These are the things you need to understand
if you are to judge the probability that alien

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.759
life could come and visit us.

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.829
What is a galaxy?

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.149
&gt;&gt; Specifically I wouldn’t know.

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:52.109
&gt;&gt; Is a galaxy something totally different,
like another universe maybe?

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:55.240
&gt;&gt; A galaxy is a sun and a moon, isn’t it?&gt;&gt;

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:02.860
So a galaxy is bigger than that.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.790
&gt;&gt; Galaxies, hundreds of stars, blah, blah,
blah.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.700
&gt;&gt; In fact, hundreds of billions of stars.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.770
&gt;&gt; Billions of stars.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, hundreds of billions.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.110
&gt;&gt; What is a galaxy?

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.080
It is a collection of stars and gas that are
held together in a gravitationally bound system.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.990
Every point of light that you see here is
a star.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.400
When we say 200 billion stars, it is probably
at least 200 billion stars.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.340
The galaxy is 100,000 light years across.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.440
So, you know, it is just... the distances
are unimaginable.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.910
One light year, don’t forget, is 10 trillion
kilometers.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.170
&gt;&gt; What is a light year?

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.500
You are an engineer.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.550
&gt;&gt; A light year is a thousand years, isn’t
it?&gt;&gt;

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.190
A light year is a thousand years?

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.190
&gt;&gt; Isn’t it?

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.640
&gt;&gt; Oh, about 150 million years...

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.640
&gt;&gt; Would be a light year.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.640
&gt;&gt; Would be a light year.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.330
That is what I believe it would be.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.330
&gt;&gt; It is a distance.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.330
&gt;&gt; Is it a distance?

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.330
A light year?

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.330
&gt;&gt; Have you heard the term exoplanet?

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.330
&gt;&gt; No.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.330
&gt;&gt; No.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.330
Never.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.330
&gt;&gt; Exoplanet.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.330
No.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.910
&gt;&gt; Like a planet that we are not aware?

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.159
&gt;&gt; Well, exo should be... could be short for
something.

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.030
&gt;&gt; Extraterrestrial planet or extraterrestrial
life, maybe.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.500
&gt;&gt; Something outside our planet.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.590
&gt;&gt; So an exoplanet is simply a planet that
orbits a star other than the sun.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.200
Exo just means external, outside, so outside
our solar system.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.310
So it is just a planet.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.760
You know, you can...

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.060
&gt;&gt; How many have you found?&gt;&gt;

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.400
Me personally?

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.730
I have found six.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.680
But overall we now know of over 800 planets
that have been confirmed and another probably

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.760
2000 planets that are waiting for information,
but are pretty strong candidates.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.620
So we don’t see the planet directly, we
see its impact on the start that it orbits.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.850
We do it from the ground with a angle Australian
telescope and we look for the wobble of the

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.280
star as the planet orbits it.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.580
The planet goes around and the start moves
backwards and forwards.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.270
So if you can imagine seeing that from sort
of along the line of sight a little bit more,

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.650
say like in this cartoon here, then you would
see the star moving towards you and moving

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.650
away from you.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.350
And so what we see here is the light from
the star becoming ever so slightly bluer as

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.740
it moves towards us and ever so slightly redder
as it moves away.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.160
The big problem is that the main kind of planet
you end up finding with this wobble technique,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.310
because it is really reliant on the mass of
the planet, basically like Jupiter, Saturn

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.830
and then we have started to get down to Neptune
and Uranus.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:30.250
&gt;&gt; To find smaller planets NASA launched Kepler,
a one meter telescope with a 95 megapixel

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.250
camera.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.820
Its mission is to observe 130,000 stars in
our galaxy and look for dips in brightness

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.420
caused by planets passing in front of them.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.940
&gt;&gt; So Kepler-62 is a solar system with five
planets and the planets are very similar in

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.410
size to the terrestrial planets, the rocky
planets in our own solar system.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.310
They have a star in the middle and then you
have three inner planets.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.540
There is a green band which is this habitable
zone, the goldilocks zone where you can expect

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.840
liquid water to exist on the surface of the
planet.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.550
And, in fact, there are two planets inside
the habitable zone around Kepler-62.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.420
If you are going to start looking for life
around nearby stars, this is probably the

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.699
best one to start with.

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.960
&gt;&gt; Is there life beyond the earth?&gt;&gt;

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.639
Well we don’t know for sure.

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:15.990
We can’t say yes definitely.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.910
But the probability is very high.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.930
There are at least 200 billion stars in our
galaxy.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.910
We now know that on average there is at least
one planet per star in our galaxy alone and

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.840
there are another 100 plus billion galaxies
in the universe.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.480
We also now know, thanks to the Kepler spacecraft,
that at least one in six of those is earth

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.480
sized.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.139
And so that is 33 billion potential earth
sized planets.

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:39.920
Not all of them are going to be able to have
life.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.870
But the probability is getting pretty high
already at this stage.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.350
&gt;&gt; So there is no definitive evidence that
alien life exists, but the sheer size of the

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.710
numbers suggest that they must be out there
somewhere.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.030
But with the vast distances across the universe,
chances are it is going to be a long time

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.449
before we know for certain that we are not
alone.

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:07.340

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:16.040
&gt;&gt; Ok.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.310
&gt;&gt; Is there more than one galaxy out there?

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.460
&gt;&gt; Yeah, probably.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.500
&gt;&gt; How many would you say?

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.070
&gt;&gt; Oh, I couldn’t tell you.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.460
There is probably more than on my 10 fingers,
I guess.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.330
&gt;&gt; It is more than 100 billion.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.330
&gt;&gt; A hundred billion?

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.330
Probably.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:35.330
&gt;&gt; It is crazy.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.331
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
