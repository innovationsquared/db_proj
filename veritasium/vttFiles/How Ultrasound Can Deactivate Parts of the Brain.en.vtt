00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.580
[Derek] How do you fix a brain that's not working properly?

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.080
Well, until now the only real option has been to open up the skull,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.780
implant electrical or optical fibers, or even remove parts of the brain.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.360
If you do something like surgery or ablation, even with ultrasound, that's an irreversible one-time procedure.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.800
But this scientist has a different idea.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.740
Do you wanna introduce yourself?

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.620
Yeah, sure. Yeah, I'm Mikhail Shapiro. Where should I look?

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.200
[Derek] You can look at me, yeah!

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.940
[Mikhail] Yeah, I'm Mikhail Shapiro. I'm a professor of chemical engineering at Caltech.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.360
Everything that we try to do is to make it non-invasive,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.300
meaning that we don't want to have any kind of surgery to open up the skull and implant an electrode,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.440
or we don't want to have to open up the skull to shine light onto the neurons.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.340
We want to do it using sound waves,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.340
which is one of the few forms of energy that can be focused deep inside of the tissue

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.000
and can actually permeate through things like the skull, even the human skull.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.380
This is a curved transducer, so you can see there is a slight curvature in it

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.620
that will cause the sound waves to get concentrated a few centimeters in front of the face of this transducer.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.620
[Derek] For now, the research is being conducted on mice,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:19.960
and the idea is to be able to turn on and off specific brain regions at will, without invasive surgery.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.360
[Mikhail] So the trick that we employ here,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.300
is that we take something that's traditionally been a really big problem in neuroscience drugs,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.420
and we turn it into an advantage.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.260
So the problem is that the brain has what's called the blood-brain barrier

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:42.040
which lines the blood vessels of the brain and prevents molecules moving from the bloodstream into the brain.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.560
[Derek] But in their procedure, they open the blood-brain barrier in carefully targeted regions of the brain.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.760
[Mikhail] So to do this, we introduce little bubbles into the blood stream.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.780
[Derek] Air bubbles.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.320
[Mikhail] Bubbles of air, but they are safe bubbles.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.000
So this is an FDA-approved clinically used-

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.260
[Derek] Like tiny bubbles?

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.160
[Mikhail] They're microns in scale.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.640
[Derek] Okay. Tiny air bubbles.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.540
[Mikhail] So tiny little air bubbles,

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.640
that we introduce into the into the bloodstream and so they're circulating everywhere.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.600
And then wherever we apply the ultrasound, the sound waves cause the bubbles to expand and contract in size,

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:23.340
and as they're doing that they push against the blood vessel walls, and kind of massage them open.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.900
So they get that blood-brain barrier that's normally caused by really tight

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.380
junctions between cells to open just a crack,

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.880
so that now molecules can get out, into the brain.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.520
[Derek] And by using the ultrasound you can target just specific areas of the brain

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.240
where you want to open the blood-brain barrier and leave the rest of the brain alone.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.040
[Mikhail] Exactly.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.420
[Derek] Once the blood-brain barrier is open, the scientists inject a specially made virus

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.040
that would normally not be able to pass into the brain.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.520
[Mikhail] These viral vectors, which are viruses that we have hijacked,

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.400
so that instead of them introducing their DNA to the cells,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.640
they're going to introduce the DNA that we want

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.160
and what this gene produces are these receptors that will go on to the neuron.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.580
These receptors have been modified so they no longer respond

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.620
to neurotransmitters that are natively present inside the brain

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.980
and will instead respond to a drug that we can inject

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.340
that will activate just those receptors and not act on anything else.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.880
I'll tell you when we get to a part where your camera's going to get sucked into the magnet before it happens.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.580
[Derek] Thank you.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.580
I appreciate that.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.860
[Mikhail] So this big machine here is what generates the sound waves that we use.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:43.380
This little device will get installed on here, and then we're gonna have a mouse underneath,

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.060
and then this entire thing is going to go into the MRI scanner.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.400
[Derek] Is this a special ultrasound for... mice?

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.400
[Mikhail] Both the MRI is special for mice, because as you can see from the bore that's in the middle of it

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.340
[Derek] Yeah. A human's not gonna fit in there!

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.300
[Mikhail] Yeah, well it'd have to be a really small human.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.480
And then our ultrasound system also is designed for these kind of small animals

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.780
[Derek] And that squeaking sound that I'm hearing. That's not actually mice in there-

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.380
That's the MRI?

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.080
[Mikhail] Yeah.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.280
[Derek] How strong is the magnetic field in there?

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.660
[Mikhail] Inside the scanner it's 7 Tesla.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.320
[Derek] Whoa!

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.090
[Mikhail] Yeah. So it's going to give us an image of the anatomy of the brain

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.640
and allow us to target the focus of this ultrasound transducer

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.720
to precisely the part of the brain where we want to open the blood-brain barrier.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.900
[Jerzy] There will be four bright spots that will appear on the brain just about here

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.700
So this is the opening of the barrier between the blood and the brain.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.520
That allows a diffusion of what is essentially a

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.940
magnetic resonance imaging dye that shows up during the MRI imaging.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.280
This is the hippocampus.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.220
The hippocampus is a fairly large structure that's important in the formation of memory

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.080
and this is the one that we targeted in our recent study to modulate the memory of mice.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.520
[Mikhail] We targeted the hippocampus,

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.100
which is this part of the brain that's necessary for the formation of certain kinds of memories,

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.200
and using our technique, we can address just the neurons within the hippocampus,

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.420
and when we give a drug those neurons get shut down

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.480
And then we can do behavioral experiments where we did a memory task,

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.180
where we put the mice into a particular environment and check to the next day

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.440
by bringing the mice back into that same environment whether or not they could remember it.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.000
And for the mice that were treated with the ultrasound,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.960
with the receptors through the viral vectors, and given the drug that activates these receptors,

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.360
that shut down the hippocampus.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.320
Those mice were not able to remember,

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.460
so we could tell that we were successfully able to inhibit or prevent memory formation.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.980
Because the effect depends on when you give this drug, and how much of the drug you give,

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.500
you can have reversible, turning on or off of the effect that you're trying to produce.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.560
So for example, shutting down the part of the brain that's causing a seizure.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.440
So another part of the brain that we're pretty interested in is called the ventral tegmental area,

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.060
which is a part of the brain that uses the neurotransmitter dopamine,

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:17.740
and is involved in things like motivation, and addiction, and initiation and control of movement.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.440
And if we can gain control over the neurons in that area,

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.740
it might someday be useful treatments for some of these

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.420
motivational or affective disorders like addiction and our depression.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.600
[Derek] Could you use this to control people's brains?

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.130
Like by playing ultrasound, into some area?

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.680
[Mikhail] No, there is not a chance, at least using our technology,

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.520
that you could be walking around and we could be controlling your brain remotely.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.800
... if that's what you're worried about.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.560
[Derek] Not yet, anyway.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.820
[Mikhail] That is not our goal!

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.560
[Derek] Right.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.960
Hey, this video was supported by viewers like you on Patreon and by Skillshare.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.760
Skillshare is an online learning community with thousands of classes in a wide range of subjects;

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.780
everything from video production and animation, to business, marketing, entrepreneurship, and more.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.620
Now the idea is they get actual experts working in their fields to teach these classes.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.560
For example, they have a class on animation by Kurzgesagt,

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.480
and I personally found that class really informative and helpful.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.860
I mean who wouldn't want to animate like Kurzgesagt?

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:24.780
In fact in making the animations for this video, I worked closely with a professional editor and animator,

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.460
and I was better able to do that thanks to taking this class.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.220
Now if you want to check it out, the first 500 people to sign up via the link below

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.820
get two months free and besides that it's less than ten dollars a month,

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.180
so definitely a worthwhile investment if you want to upskill in any of the areas they offer.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.840
That premium membership gives you unlimited access to any and all classes on the platform,

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.220
and I should probably point out that this makes a great gift idea too.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.620
Or just as a way to start the new year with some new skills and knowledge.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.020
So I really want to thank Skillshare for supporting Veritasium, and I want to thank you for watching.
