00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.960
if you can answer my Techie Test question later in the show.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.020
On May 1st, 2015 a group of scientists predicted that the following November,

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:23.700
we would see a star go supernova billions of light years away in a spiral galaxy designated SP1149.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.640
This was the first time anyone had ever tried to predict a supernova.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.060
And for good reason: they are incredibly rare and unpredictable.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.600
For a star larger than 8 times the mass of our sun,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.480
a supernova marks the end of its life cycle.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.040
Running out of fuel in its core, the star collapses in on itself,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.740
and then, in the ensuing crush of matter, it violently explodes.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.600
A supernova can be as bright as a whole galaxy.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.500
And importantly, the light emitted follows a predictable pattern:

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.500
it glows brightly for weeks and then fades down over a period of months

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.980
But supernovae are rare.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.480
In any galaxy of 100 billion stars or so,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.120
you can expect on average only two per century.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.460
So just try picking the star that is going to explode.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.780
Now, we can say how long a given star will live based on its mass, luminosity and color temperature.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.660
These data pinpoint its stage of life in a predictable life cycle.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.220
But the estimate of exactly when a large star will go supernova has big error bars.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.960
Take the red supergiant Betelgeuse, for example, in our own Milky Way Galaxy.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.580
It is a great candidate to go supernova.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.680
Scientists think Betelgeuse will explode any day now in the next few...

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.500
hundred thousand years.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.560
When it does, it'll be so bright you can see it in the daytime, and it will rival the full moon’s brightness at night.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.860
Compared to the lifespan of a star, a hundred thousand years is a brief window of time,

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.620
but for us short-lived humans, it may as well be forever.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.860
So you might think it would have been a tough sell when the scientists who predicted we’d see a supernova in November 2015

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.400
asked for time on the Hubble Space Telescope to take pictures of galaxy SP1149.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.420
But their request was granted.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.740
They could image this part of the sky roughly once a month starting on October 30th.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.100
Before this, the galaxy was too close to the sun to point Hubble at it.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.340
In this first image taken at the end of October there is no supernova.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.120
The next image was taken on Nov. 14

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.440
Again, no Supernova.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.000
But in third image, taken on Dec. 11th, jackpot.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.540
There’s a supernova right where they predicted it would be and almost exactly when they said it would happen

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.500
So how did they manage to predict a supernova, almost to the month?

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.000
Well the truth is they had seen this same exact supernova before.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.780
Not once, not twice, but four additional times!

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.900
A year earlier and five months before the predictions, Hubble took this image.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.700
See those 4 bright dots?

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.900
Those are multiple images of that same supernova.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.220
The reason we see the same supernova in four different locations

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.300
is because there is a lens between us and the exploding star

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.540
not a lens made of glass of course but a gravitational lens

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.880
made of a huge amount of ordinary matter and dark matter.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:38.720
Gravitational lensing tends to magnify distant sources and increase their apparent brightness, as rays of light become concentrated.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.120
This smears the image of distant galaxies into arcs, strands, and all kinds of weird shapes.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.620
And of course, to some distant observer in another galaxy,

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.900
the light from our sun and Milky Way galaxy may be similarly warped

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.840
In gravitational lensing, there are three essential components --

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.240
the source, the lens, and the telescope.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.040
If the lens and the source are spherically symmetric,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.140
And if the source, lens, and telescope are all perfectly aligned,

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.780
you get what’s known as an Einstein ring.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.140
The light from the source is bent around the lens, equally in all directions,

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.580
leading to the image of a smeared out ring.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.460
If the source and the lens are spherically symmetric, but are not perfectly aligned,

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.600
what we end up seeing is a break in the Einstein ring --

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.860
it splits into two semi-circles.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.720
And if the source, lens and telescope are aligned but the lens is not axially symmetric

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.540
for example it could have an elliptical shape -

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.700
then you get four images in the shape of a cross, an Einstein cross.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.440
So what happened to our supernova is

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:54.540
9.3 billion years ago, a dying star in a galaxy far, far away went out with a bang as a supernova.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.280
The explosion sent out a blast of light in all directions.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.960
About 5 billion years ago, before the Earth even existed,

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.780
that light encountered a very massive object that warped spacetime

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:14.580
it was a cluster of galaxies called MACS J1149.5+2223.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.680
(I know that’s a mouthful. But the name just tells us

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.220
where in the sky it was discovered by the MAssive Cluster Survey.)

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.580
This galaxy cluster is made of lots of massive substructures

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.140
like individual galaxies and halos of dark matter.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.260
At some point as the light traveled through this region,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:39.300
it encountered an elliptical galaxy almost perfectly lined up with where the Earth would eventually be.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:47.480
The gravitational deflection focused light rays that were initially diverging onto paths that converged at the Earth.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.100
This is why we saw the same supernova in four different locations.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.520
Not only did the supernova appear at 4 different places,

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.520
the images also appeared at different times.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:06.380
Relative to the first image, the others were delayed by periods ranging from 5 days to over 3 weeks.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.880
We could measure this time delay because of the distinctive light-curve of the supernova.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.540
Some of the images of the explosion were further along in their light curve than others.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.880
This was a particularly lucky discovery -

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.760
the first time a multiply-lensed supernova has ever been observed.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:30.060
There are other objects that due to gravitational lensing appear multiple times on the sky, like multiple images of galaxies.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.860
But these objects don’t change predictably with time

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.940
so there is no way to use their images to work out the relative time delay between them.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:45.680
One reason for the time delay is because the four paths the light took were different lengths.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.780
So it took the light longer to travel further.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.980
But there is another reason:

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:58.700
Light passing through curved spacetime appears to travel more slowly relative to an external observer.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:04.960
This is much less intuitive, but is a well established and well tested part of General Relativity.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.960
Back in 1964, Irwin Shapiro suggested

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.260
it would be possible to test this gravitational time delay

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:16.660
by sending radar signals to Venus, and measuring how long it takes for the echo to come back.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.140
He calculated that, due to the gravitational influence of the sun,

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:27.500
the signals would take an extra 200 microseconds when Venus was on the other side of the sun compared to when it was close to us.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:34.600
This is solely a gravitational time delay, not related to the extra distance the light has to travel.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.960
And within a couple years,

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:43.480
experimental data revealed the gravitational time delay for light traveling past the sun, was exactly as predicted.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:49.020
Today, in order to accurately determine the distance to the Voyager and Pioneer spacecraft,

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.460
this Shapiro time delay must be taken into account.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.440
Now I want you to have a look at the four supernova images again.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.660
Do you notice how the same galaxy appears three times in this image?

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.120
That is the supernova’s host galaxy.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.520
It is itself lensed by the 

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:11.800
massive galaxy cluster MACS J1149.5+2223

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.480
In fact, this cluster lenses tens of galaxies.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.060
So scientists had been studying and modeling the distribution of matter in the cluster

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.960
long before the supernova.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:28.780
They asked: if we see these four images of the supernova in one image of its host galaxy,

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:33.560
when would the supernova appear in these other two images of the host galaxy?

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.160
Using the models of mass distribution and General Relativity,

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:44.660
they calculated that in this image the supernova would have appeared twenty years earlier - in 1995!

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.780
Now there are no close-up pictures of this part of the sky from 1995

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.780
so there is no way to check.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:57.660
But in the other image of the galaxy they predicted the supernova would appear again in about one year's time

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.140
Almost exactly when it showed up in that Hubble image.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:10.520
This successful prediction is a fantastic confirmation of our understanding of light and gravity on the scale of the whole universe.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.300
But it has even bigger implications.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.120
One of the hottest debates in astronomy right now is:

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.240
how fast is our universe actually expanding?

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.620
This is measured by the Hubble constant:

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:26.860
the rate at which distant galaxies are receding, depending on their distance apart.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.660
There are two main ways this measurement has traditionally been made.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:37.060
One is to look for stars in the nearby universe whose absolute luminosity we know.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.560
Then we can use how bright they appear to us to determine how far away they are.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.300
If you combine this distance information with how redshifted their light is,

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.600
you can work out how fast the universe is expanding.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.520
This is known as the distance ladder method

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:58.860
and the value of the Hubble constant it produces is around 74 kilometers per second per megaparsec.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.560
Meaning for every megaparsec that separates two galaxies,

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.680
they will on average be moving apart at 74 km/s

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:14.020
The other way to measure the Hubble constant is to study the features in the cosmic microwave background radiation-

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.500
which is essentially just a picture of the early universe.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.580
Using the standard model of cosmology (which is called Lambda-CDM)

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:26.080
we can work out how this early universe picture would expand over time.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:31.600
The result obtained from this method comes out to 67 kilometers per second per megaparsec,

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.700
substantially slower than the 74 found via the other method.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:40.880
Over the years both of these techniques have been refined, reducing their uncertainties

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.260
but the values have not gotten closer together.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.340
So at this moment the two values really seem different -

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:52.540
they are on the cusp of being a 5 sigma result.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:58.040
Astrophysicist Joseph Silk has called it a “possible crisis for cosmology”

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.880
But there are independent ways to measure the Hubble constant.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.560
One of them is to look at a mutiply-lensed supernova

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.120
and use the time delay between their appearances to work it out.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:14.040
This was first proposed by a Norwegian astronomer Sjur Refsdal in 1964.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:20.660
Since this is the first observed multiply-lensed supernova, it has become known as Supernova Refsdal.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:27.620
Calculations of the Hubble constant from this data yield a value of 64 kilometers per second per megaparsec.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.200
And although the result has large error bars,

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:35.760
it is more in line with the measurements of the cosmic microwave background than with the distance ladder method.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:40.620
The thing I keep thinking about is how strange space is.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.360
I mean, I used to think of it essentially like glass, 

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.120
fundamentally transparent with some foggy regions or some slight distortions.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.720
But here we have space warping light on multiple curved trajectories,

00:11:52.720 --> 00:12:01.880
making the same event appear in six different places on the sky separated by days, weeks, a year and twenty years.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:09.480
And what is contained in those distortions is information about the workings of our entire universe.

Now on to my techie test question:

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:07.160
Which famous scientist criticized Newtonian gravity saying:

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.440
"That Gravity should be innate, inherent and essential to Matter,

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.420
so that one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum, 

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.400
without the mediation of anything else...

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.520
is to me so great an absurdity that 

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:27.680
I believe no Man who has in philosophical Matters a competent Faculty of thinking can ever fall into it."
