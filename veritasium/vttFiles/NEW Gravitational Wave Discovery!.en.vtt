00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.460
I've come to Caltech because there is a
brand new gravitational wave discovery.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.740
Let's go find out what it is.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.580
Can we talk about the discovery, Rana?
-Yeah.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.000
Can I-- I want to sit on one of my black holes.
-Alright.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.400
If you notice, this one's a big one

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.740
and that one's a little one.
-This one is a little one.
-Yeah.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.300
I-I always feel like I'm the most excited out of everybody.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.800
Really?
-Yeah.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.600
Because excited when nothing's happening.
Cleaning some dust off a piece of glass

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.170
and it still seems exciting, because I think
this is the key piece of glass in our

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.140
system and I'm just clean dust off of it.
How cool is that?

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.520
On January 4th,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.030
just like a few hours after midnight.
Boom. We got another signal much like the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.910
first signal we found in September of
2015. And it's also well represented by

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.219
these black holes that we're sitting on.
One of the black holes had a mass of

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:09.360
about 30 solar masses and the other one
was about 20. And this one lasted

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.950
longer than the first one. Both because
our detectors are better at the lowest

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.860
frequencies and because the signal is
from black holes which are smaller, so

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.780
they last longer. And it's really
dramatic if you listen to the audio.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.680
The first signal that we got, it's only
audible for about a tenth of a second.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.820
It's just, "boomp," like this. But this new
one sounds like "bvoom."

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.140
It's a little bit more drawn-out and it comes from
farther away.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.560
It's the furthest black hole merger that we've been
able to detect. So it's about three billion light

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.369
years away, which means that signal-- the
merger actually happened three billion

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.180
years ago and the signal has been
propagating to us for three billion years.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.640
What's particularly interesting in
this merger are hints that the two black

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.160
holes weren't spinning with the same
orientation as each other or as their orbit.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.000
This suggests that rather than
forming out of binary stars, they formed

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.280
separately and later became entwined
through orbital dynamics.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.789
This one really says,
okay, we now know that we're going

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.160
to be seeing a lot of these things.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.310
It's a...

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.650
It's a relief to have another signal to know
that the universe is not just populated

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.100
by all tiny, tiny black holes or by no
black holes.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.460
If we improve our detector

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.480
sensitivity by say a factor of two or
three, the rates will go up from, you know,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.480
seeing one every month or every two
months to seeing one every day or every week.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.090
I would say it's very surprising
now that our first three signals came

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.750
from binary black hole mergers which,
were pretty much an unexpected source

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.860
as of mid-2015.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.750
There's a working theory --
kind of exotic -- that says that some of

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.510
the black holes we're seeing are
primordial, alright? They weren't formed

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.380
through, you know, conventional supernova
explosions. They were formed during the

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.640
Big Bang themselves. And they could be a
part of Dark Matter, component of dark matter.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.040
So we may actually
determine after we get statistics on

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.950
lots and lots and lots of these black
hole mergers that we're actually seeing

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.860
maybe a hint of dark matter.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.660
It's sort of
scratching at the door of the biggest

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.580
mysteries that we have today in
cosmology.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.860
In the past before there were any signals, 
people used to use this phrase,

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.620
which I completely disagree with.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.540
And they would say, "you know if we don't
find any signals it will be even more

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.060
interesting than if we do."
I said no no no no no. No no no no.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.200
Lots of signals. That's what we want.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.170
But now that we have a few,
I'm feeling a little bit more

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.720
complacent. And so I'd say we really
expected to see a lot of binary neutron stars,

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.220
and if we don't, well isn't that interesting?
It means there's something going on--

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.900
You know, you have all the
pieces. We already know how neutron 
 stars work.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.720
We've seen neutron stars
using radio astronomy. We know they're

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.480
out there, we know that they come
together in binaries.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.840
But why don't we see their gravitational waves?

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.020
So it could be something else happens to them

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.080
just before the final merger and there's
something in their evolutionary track

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.460
which goes off in a different direction
than what we expect.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.480
And I think that would actually be interesting.
I guess I've become one of those people that

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.900
said if you don't see it then maybe it's
interesting, because we'll learn something.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.440
You never know how many more signals we
have sitting in the can that we're not

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.600
telling you about.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.880
Can you say that again?

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.400
I don't think so. 
-Would you give me the exclusive, Rana?

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.780
I would! You know it, Derek. Come on.
If I had secret signals, you'd be the first to know.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.680
These lights are the
first two tentacles of the jellyfish I'm

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.210
building, and there's a neural network
which then drives this little chip, which

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.290
modulates these lights. And it's going to use these sensors like the proximity and the

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.280
sound to figure out if people are close
to it. And the neural network is going to

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.510
train itself to flash the tentacle
lights to make people come closer to it.
