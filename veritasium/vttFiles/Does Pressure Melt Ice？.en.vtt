00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.700
I'm gonna try to demonstrate something called regelation.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.100
Which is where you provide a pressure onto ice

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.100
and that turns it into water but after that pressure is removed it freezes again

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.100
So, in order to demonstrate this I've taken apart the high E string from my guitar.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.500
I chose the E string because it's thinner than a G string and that's important.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.300
And I've weighted it with these two bottles of water.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:29.500
When I apply the string across the ice we should see the wire start to cut through the ice

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.700
And perform the regelation of the ice.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.100
where we'll see if it works because we are outside in Sydney and it's warmer than 0Â°C obviously.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.100
All right, it's past 3 A.M. but the experiment has been a success

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.800
I passed this wire through this giant block of ice

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.800
And it 's still a solid block.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.900
You can actually see the point where the wire went through, here.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.900
 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.900
So, we pretty clearly demonstrated regelation.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.900
The idea that you can compress the ice, turn it into water and then

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.200
when that pressure is gone it solidifies again as ice.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.900
Pretty cool stuff.
