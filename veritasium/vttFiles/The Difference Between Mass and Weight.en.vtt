00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
*steps*

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.300
 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.710
What is the difference

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.590
between mass and weight? I think it's
something that a lot of people are

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.490
confused about.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.160
They just think that anything that's big
like this car

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.310
has a lot of weight, is very heavy

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.100
it's gotta lot of mass and people just
basically think of these ideas

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.449
as all the same. But there's an important
distinction between the terms

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.769
mass and weight. Mass at first is the amount of

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.280
matter in an object whereas weight is a
force.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.879
It's the gravitational attraction that
the object feels

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.850
towards in this case the Earth's center. So
got a little experiment

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.800
today where I brought my car at here and ask some people.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.350
Why is it difficult to push my car? And my bet is the answer will be because the car is heavy. (no duh)

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.010
Because it's heavy. Because it's too heavy. (we get it, your car is heavy.)

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.879
A big rock you would think would be

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:02.340
heavy

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.369
It's too heavy.

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.650
It's been lighter than I thought. It is because its weight.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.220
Weight is responsible. What is weight? Weight is mass in a gravity.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.080
What it this gravity thing?

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.540
Gravity is what keeps ...

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.860
*talking indecisively*

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.960
Your car is pulled towards at the center

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:28.479
of the earth

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.409
yes. But now when you push it, as in pushing your car, you are not pushing it up.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.060
Do you know what I mean? But it's still hard to push. Yeah

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.090
So do you think weight is responsible for making it hard to push?

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.500
 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.810
But I'm not trying
to lift the car and I'm just trying to push it

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.099
A big rock you would think would
be heavy. Anything that is big

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:59.340
we think it would be heavy but I'm not
lifting it on pushing so it's also gravity

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:03.439
but this is my question right? but
I'm not trying to lift it

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.909
No, thats true. But it's
still hard to push.

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.670
So why is that? because like if I
lift it, I understand

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.390
you are saying it's heavy and it'd be really hard but we're pushing it actually

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.329
getting it to go

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.170
So how does that work. 
The answer is

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.260
because the car has inertia. 
Inertia means

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.410
that objects with mass have a tendency to resist

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.889
changes in their motion. And I thought
she had a great answer when I started

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:30.780
which was inertia

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.100
Can you tell us about that? What's inertia?
It's just like once something stops

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.109
it doesn't really wanna go unless something is going. It doesn't mind and would stop.

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.660
The idea that I'm trying to get
is actually is that it's these are actually two different things.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.780
Right? One thing is that there's a force
pulling a stand into the earth

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.290
and that's what we call weight and that
makes it impossible to lift

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.769
but there's something else which is
called inertia and that mean something

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.069
is difficult to

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.549
change its motion because got a lot of
inertia

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.090
and that's why it's difficult to push
which is different than when it's difficult

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.769
to lift.

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.919
Which is the weight force pulling it down
towards here

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:09.000
Fair enough but it's actually not as
difficult to push. It's not that hard

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.510
yeah I know it doesn't prove my point (Subtitles by Jimena)
