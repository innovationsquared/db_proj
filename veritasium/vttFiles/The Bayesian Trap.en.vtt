00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Picture this: You wake up one morning and

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.100
you feel a little bit sick. No particular

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.230
symptoms, just not 100%.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.269
So you go to the doctor and she also

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.620
doesn't know what's going on with you, so

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.200
she suggests they run a battery of tests

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.929
and after a week goes by, the results

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.270
come back, turns out you tested positive

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.580
for a very rare disease that affects

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.020
about 0.1% of the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.730
population and it's a nasty disease,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.320
horrible consequences, you don't want it.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.630
So you ask the doctor "You know, how

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.670
certain is it that I have this disease?"

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.800
and she says "Well, the test will

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.620
correctly identify 99% of people that

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.960
have the disease and only incorrectly

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.059
identify 1% of people who don't

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.000
have the disease". So that sounds pretty

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.489
bad. I mean, what are the chances that you

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.850
actually have this disease? I think most

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.430
people would say 99%, because

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.850
that's the accuracy of the test. But that

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.820
is not actually correct! You need Bayes' Theorem

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.560
to get some perspective.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.240
Bayes' Theorem can give you the

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.070
probability that some hypothesis, say

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.720
that you actually have the disease, is

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.960
true given an event; that you tested

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.210
positive for the disease. To calculate

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.500
this, you need to take the prior

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.720
probability of the hypothesis was true - that

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.520
is, how likely you thought it was that

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.110
you have this disease before you got the

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.030
test results - and multiply it by the

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.710
probability of the event given the

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.600
hypothesis is true - that is, the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.890
probability that you would test positive

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.770
if you had the disease - and then divide

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.600
that by the total probability of the

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.399
event occurring - that is testing positive.

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.710
This term is a combination of your

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.210
probability of having the disease and

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.340
correctly testing positive plus your

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.899
probability of not having the disease

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.750
and being falsely identified. The prior

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.729
probability that a hypothesis is true is

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.350
often the hardest part of this equation

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.960
to figure out and, sometimes, it's no

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.970
better than a guess. But in this case, a

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.560
reasonable starting point is the

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.789
frequency of the disease in the

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.729
population, so 0.1%. And if

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.110
you plug in the rest of the numbers, you

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.970
find that you have a 9% chance

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.340
of actually having the disease after

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.280
testing positive. Which is incredibly low

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.739
if you think about it. Now, this isn't

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.170
some sort of crazy magic. It's actually

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.870
common sense applied to mathematics. Just

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.030
think about a sample size of 1000

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.670
people. Now, one person out of that

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.040
thousand, is likely to actually have the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.180
disease. And the test would likely

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.160
identify them correctly as having the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.250
disease. But out of the 999 other people,

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.030
1% or 10 people would falsely

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.920
be identified as having the disease. So,

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.840
if you're one of those people who has a

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.180
positive test result and everyone's just

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.530
selected at random - well, you're actually

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.780
part of a group of 11 where only one

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.019
person has the disease. So your chances

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:56.109
of actually having it are 1 in 11. 9%. It just makes sense. When Bayes

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.030
first came up with this theorem he

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.410
didn't actually think it was

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.180
revolutionary. He didn't even think it

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.769
was worthy of publication, he didn't

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.870
submit it to the Royal Society of which

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.000
he was a member, and in fact it was

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.400
discovered in his papers after he died

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.370
and he had abandoned it for more than a

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.890
decade. His relatives asked his friend,

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.810
Richard Price, to dig through his papers

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.430
and see if there is anything worth

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.630
publishing in there. And that's where

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.450
Price discovered what we now know as

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.150
the origins of Bayes' Theorem. Bayes

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.980
originally considered a thought

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.050
experiment where he was sitting with his

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.030
back to a perfectly flat, perfectly

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.950
square table and then he would ask an

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.230
assistant to throw a ball onto the table.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.170
Now this ball could obviously land and

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.300
end up anywhere on the table and he

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.280
wanted to figure out where it was. So

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.050
what he'd asked his assistant to do was

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.510
to throw on another ball and then tell him

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.760
if it landed to the left, or to the right,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.790
or in front, behind of the first ball, and

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.630
he would note that down and then ask for

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.310
more and more balls to be thrown on the

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.560
table. What he realized, was that through

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.019
this method he could keep updating his

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.390
idea of where the first ball was. Now of

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.620
course, he would never be completely

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.660
certain, but with each new piece of

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.970
evidence, he would get more and more

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.690
accurate, and that's how Bayes saw the

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.579
world. It wasn't that he thought the

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.190
world was not determined, that reality

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.010
didn't quite exist, but it was that we

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.380
couldn't know it perfectly, and all we

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.419
could hope to do was update our

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.880
understanding as more and more evidence

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.729
became available. When Richard Price

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.330
introduced Bayes' Theorem, he made an

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.580
analogy to a man coming out of a cave,

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.770
maybe he'd lived his whole life in there

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.780
and he saw the Sun rise for the first

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.970
time, and kind of thought to himself: "Is,

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.039
Is this a one-off, is this a quirk, or

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.680
does the Sun always do this?" And then,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.410
every day after that, as the Sun rose

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.900
again, he could get a little bit more

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.050
confident, that, well, that was the way the

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.510
world works. So Bayes' Theorem wasn't

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.039
really a formula intended to be used

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:00.840
just once, it was intended to be used

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.270
multiple times, each time gaining new

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.940
evidence and updating your probability

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.190
that something is true. So if we go back

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.750
to the first example when you tested

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.389
positive for a disease, what would happen

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.669
if you went to another doctor, get a

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.560
second opinion and get that test run

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.479
again, but let's say by a different lab,

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.039
just to be sure that those tests are

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.830
independent, and let's say that test also

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.560
comes back as positive. Now what is the

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.419
probability that you actually have the

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.640
disease? Well, you can use Bayes formula

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.099
again, except this time for your prior

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:33.599
probability that you have the disease,

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.400
you have to put in the posterior

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.290
probability, the probability that we

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.030
worked out before which is 9%,

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.530
because you've already had one positive

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.800
test. If you crunch those numbers, the new

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.919
probability based on two positive tests

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:49.259
is 91%. There's a

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:50.580
91% chance that you

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.199
actually have the disease, which kind of

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.900
makes sense. 2 positive results by

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.180
different labs are unlikely to just be

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.229
chance, but you'll notice that

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.990
probability is still not as high as the

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.479
accuracy, the reported accuracy of the

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.479
test. Bayes' Theorem has found a number of

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.760
practical applications, including notably

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.400
filtering your spam. You know, traditional

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.919
spam filters actually do a kind of bad

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:15.930
job, there's too many false positives, too

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.300
much of your email ends up in spam, but

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.370
using a Bayesian filter, you can look at

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.199
the various words that appear in e-mails,

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:25.229
and use Bayes' Theorem to give a

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.960
probability that the email is spam, given

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.289
that those words appear. Now Bayes' Theorem

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:33.240
tells us how to update our beliefs in

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.550
light of new evidence, but it can't tell

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.310
us how to set our prior beliefs, and so

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.900
it's possible for some people to hold

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.010
that certain things are true with a

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.080
100% certainty, and other

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.060
people to hold those same things are

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.580
true with 0% certainty. What

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.440
Bayes' Theorem shows us is that in those

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.930
cases, there is absolutely no evidence,

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.840
nothing anyone could do to change their

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.389
minds, and so as Nate Silver points out

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:00.150
in his book, The Signal and The Noise, we

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.889
should probably not have debates between

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:03.570
people with a 100% prior

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.070
certainty, and 0% prior

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.560
certainty, because, well really, they'll

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.120
never convince each other of anything.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.720
Most of the time when people talk about

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.669
Bayes' Theorem, they discussed how

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:16.800
counterintuitive it is and how we don't

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.260
really have an inbuilt sense of it, but

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.150
recently my concern has been the

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.550
opposite: that maybe we're too good at

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.280
internalizing the thinking behind Bayes' Theorem,

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.830
and the reason I'm worried about

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.500
that is because, I think in life we can

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.510
get used to particular circumstances, we

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.639
can get used to results, maybe getting

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:37.590
rejected or failing at something or

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:41.159
getting paid a low wage and we can

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:44.279
internalize that as though we are that

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:45.840
man emerging from the cave and we see

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.580
the Sun rise every day and every day,

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.569
and we keep updating our beliefs to a

00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:54.150
point of near certainty that we think

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.639
that that is basically the way that

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:58.919
nature is, it's the way the world is and

00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:00.210
there's nothing that we can do to change it.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.969
You know, there's Nelson Mandela's

00:08:02.969 --> 00:08:05.189
quote that: 'Everything is impossible

00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:07.439
until it's done', and I think that is kind

00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:09.840
of a very Bayesian viewpoint on the

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.930
world, if you have no instances of

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.449
something happening, then what is your

00:08:15.449 --> 00:08:18.240
prior for that event? It will seem

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.250
completely impossible your prior may be

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.310
0 until it actually happens. You know, the

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.379
thing we forget in Bayes' Theorem is that:

00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:27.780
our actions play a role in determining

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.270
outcomes, and determining how true things

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.870
actually are. But if we internalize that

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.760
something is true and maybe we're a

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.320
100% sure that it's true, and

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.880
there's nothing we can do to change it,

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.519
well, then we're going to keep on doing

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:43.380
the same thing, and we're going to keep

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.480
on getting the same result, it's a

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.779
self-fulfilling prophecy, so I think a

00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:50.550
really good understanding of Bayes'

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.610
Theorem implies that experimentation is

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.370
essential. If you've been doing the same

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.660
thing for a long time and getting the

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.010
same result that you're not necessarily

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:03.149
happy with, maybe it's time to change.

00:09:03.149 --> 00:09:04.440
So is there something like that that you've

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.540
been thinking about? If so, let me know in the comments.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.440
Hey, this episode of Veritasium was

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.060
supported in part by viewers like you on

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.520
Patreon and by Audible. Audible is a

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.390
leading provider of spoken audio

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.400
information including an unmatched

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.080
selection of audiobooks: original,

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.720
programming, news, comedy and more.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.250
So if you're thinking about trying something new and

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.200
you haven't tried Audible yet, you

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.880
should give them a shot, and for viewers

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.830
of this channel, they offer a free 30-day

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.900
trial just by going to: audible.com/Veritasium

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.150
You know, the book I've

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.770
been listening to on Audible recently is

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:49.900
called: 'The Theory That Would Not Die' by

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.480
Sharon Bertsch McGrayne, and it is an

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.520
incredible in-depth look at Bayes'

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.070
Theorem, and I've learned a lot just

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:58.480
listening to this book, including the crazy

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.250
fact that Bayes never came up with the

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:01.720
mathematical formulation of his rule

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.580
that was done independently by the

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.770
mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace so,

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.810
really I think he deserves a lot of a

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.180
credit for this theory, but Bayes gets

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.310
naming rights because he was first, and

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.140
if you want, you can download this book

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.480
and listen to it, as I have, when I've

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.180
just been driving in the car or going to

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.510
the gym, which I'm doing again, and so if

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.040
there's a part of your day that you feel

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.080
is kind of boring then I can highly

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.700
recommend trying out audiobooks from Audible.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.340
Just go to: audible.com/Veritasium

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:31.930
So as always I want to thank:

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:33.520
Audible for supporting me, and I

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.900
want to thank you for watching.
