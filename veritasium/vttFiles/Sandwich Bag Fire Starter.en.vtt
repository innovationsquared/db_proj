00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260
Guess who just turned up at my place.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.300
It is Grant Thompson The King Of Random

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.280
G: What's up guys

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.360
D: Grant is actually going to show me a little survival tip,

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.508
let's say you're stuck out in the woods, and you need to make a fire, but you don't have say... Matches or a lighter

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.809
We're going to try to use a ziploc bag to start a fire

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.659
G: I guess when you're building a fire the first thing you're going to need is some tinder

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.180
So we're gonna have to go scavenge around for some options this stuff works pretty well

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.070
D: now this is pretty dry

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.939
G: Yeah, we definitely want something that's off the ground if possible because we need it as dry as possible

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.789
The first step was to grind up the tinder into a fine powder. I'm just following Grant's instructions here

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.679
I'm not really sure if this is going to work see that right there. That's the stuff We're going for it's super fine

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.439
We're gonna take our base plate. We're going to pinch a nice little pile in there. okay, so at this point We're pretty much ready

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:45.399
to start

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:46.899
the ignition process

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.218
So what do we need for that? ...for that We're going to need Ziplock bag and a little bit of water

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.319
Now this is just a regular ziploc sandwich Baggie. We're going to pour that in till it's about halfway full, you let me know when

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.919
Grab water from a Creek or stream or wherever you like now

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.190
Here's the trick we want to develop this into some kind [of] a liquid sphere

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.199
We're going to be making a liquid magnifying glass

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.199
I do that by turning my ziploc bag you know 45 degrees

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.470
So it creates this diamond shape and then we're [just] going to gather these two Corners together

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.390
We're going to lose a little bit of water as we do okay

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.650
I'm going to pinch that off and the next goal is to twist it trap all that water inside

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.539
You see as I twist it it creates pressure that exerts [-] almost an equal pressure on all sides

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.639
And now while it's not a perfect sphere

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.029
It will eventually start to bubble out

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.069
Into a nice liquid sphere where we need it we've essentially just made a makeshift magnifying glass

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.799
And you start to fire the same way you would with a magnifying glass

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.099
Now once he rolled the ball around you can see where it looks the best

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.790
We're looking for as close to as sphere as possible. Which is right there now if I back it out

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.869
[wow]

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.409
You can see there start smoking immediately that's incredible the focal length of the lens is the place where [all] of the light converges?

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.959
That's really what we're trying to establish here, right is

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.529
Position the tinder pile at the focal point of this

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.449
Spherical by convex lens [essentially] now you can see [that's] been smoking [for] a little while Mm-hmm

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.659
We've developed a little bit of an Ember base. It's burned a little bit

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.659
Yeah, so now I'm going to sprinkle a little bit more fuel on top there

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.929
And that will cause the heat to rise and burn that from the bottom and I'm going to again from the top nice

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:18.859
It's interesting how you're like kind of bringing it down so that the surface of that is not actually where the most concentrated

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.269
Rays are you're concentrating even deeper down into the pile. That's right because

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.919
We don't want the heat to [dissipate] too much, and if we're at an extreme focal point like this. Yes

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.229
The heats going to bleed off, so if we can warm the surrounding area it actually helps speed the process, right?

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.380
We're just going to repeat that process until it will stay smoking on its own

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.679
[we've] only been at this for a minute or two and the amount of smoke

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.489
We're seeing there is it's pretty significant [a] little bit of sprinkle a little bit of sunlight rinse and repeat. We're really elevating the temperature

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.040
Mm-Hmm I

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.340
Just point our pile smoking pretty well on its own now

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.450
I'm going to go ahead and take this plastic bag and just set it to the side we could reuse this again if we wanted

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.789
To at this point. We can probably start adding smaller pieces of tinder. You'll get a few of these little pieces here

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.160
We're going to go down to small we want it to be extremely light airy

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.659
Sure to still allow the [oxygen] to get in there exactly because if you take away the oxygen you smother the fire cool

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.149
I think right there. We're just going to let it sit for a [couple] minutes now

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.630
Well that's going we can start chopping up some of these pieces. We just found lying on the ground. They're dry

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.139
It's almost like straw. We're going to pull them into very thin fibers

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.689
We want to make something that [resembles] a bird's nest something that's light airy and can catch fire very quickly now

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.929
We need to transfer this without disturbing the coals as much as possible

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.039
The way that I like to do that is take this base. Mm-hmm. We're going to take this grass

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.980
We're going to put over top and we're just going to gently roll. It over like this

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.289
[oh] wow now you can see all those hot coals transfer down into the grass and we're just going to cover it over

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.289
To help conceal block it from some of the wind

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.880
like this and

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.609
now because of all that straw the air can flow through it and help build the heat one trick that I use it look a

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.609
Little bit funny, I just stick this in my hand and spin in circles

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.730
[see]

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.730
And it really works honestly

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.769
That's impressive

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.530
You can already see it smoking a little bit more

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.290
We're going to give that a second just for the heat to build back up

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:17.859
Yeah

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.100
but you can totally see

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.890
There's a lot more fuel catching on fire now what we want to be seeing is thicker smoke and we want to see it

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.650
progressing so we see the smoke dying down or getting weaker like slow down get out of the breeze give it a chance for the

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.940
Heat to build this is ready if you look down in there. You can almost see glowing Red Embers now

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.070
It wants to light it wants to light it

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.269
Just needs a little bit of a flick it's going to build up a little more a little spinning trick

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.070
[oh] you see that goes hot flame. I'll go amazing boom and then we're out here. Oh

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.630
Ha ha shoot. Sorry [Derrick] is [ok]

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:56.620
We've clearly demonstrated forming fire. Well that my friend is how to start a fire [with] a sandwich bag and bright side

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.970
[eh] [that's] nicely done. [I] want to say a huge. Thank you to grant here king of random

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.829
You should go check out his channel. There's lots of very random things and it's taught me a thing or two

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.340
That's for sure [a] lot about survival

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.669
Hacks and a lot of those things that you really shouldn't try at home

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.129
And then we show you why you shouldn't try them at home back?

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.179
We just put a video on my channel trying to melt glass we took a Dr.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.510
Pepper bottle and melted that in the back here, and I worked amazingly well, so go check it out

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.510
I'll put a link in the description
