00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.879
That is Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four.

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.540
It melted down on April 26, 1986.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.190
So what happened was so much heat was generated
inside that reactor that it basically blew

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:23.010
the top off spreading radioactive isotopes
throughout this whole surrounding area and

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.250
over into Europe.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:33.350
And that is why we can still detect the contamination
here today.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.750
And they covered it in that sarcophagus which
is kind of crumbling as it ages.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.870
And so they are actually building a brand
new containment facility over here which,

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.431
when it is finished, will be slid over on
top of the old containment, on top of the

00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:53.090
old sarcophagus.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.840
The town of Pripyat was built just a few kilometers
away from the reactor, mostly to house the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.360
families of the people who worked there.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.500
And now it is completely abandoned.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:13.560
So now you can find all of these high rise
Soviet apartments completely empty and crumbling

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.920
and the forest is basically reclaiming this
whole town.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.850
When the residents of Pripyat were told to
evacuate they were told that they would only

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.420
be away for two weeks.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.510
So they left most of their belongings exactly
where they were and they never came back.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:46.060
So their lives are on display here.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:02:08.170
I am inside an old kindergarten and it is
incredibly peaceful.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.850
You know, you look around and it looks like
a disaster has hit here.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:21.200
But, mainly, what this shows is 30 years of
weathering and no maintenance.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:03:05.069
So things just fall apart.

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:12.500
The most insidious thing about radiation is
how invisible it is.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.630
You can’t feel it.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.300
You can’t smell it or see it.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.760
This could be pristine wilderness, but it
is not.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:33.200
It is a contaminated, deserted waste land.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:41.459
This is what a real post-apocalyptic world
looks like: abandoned buildings, over grown

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:57.310
streets, everything crumbling, rusting, breaking.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.201
Near the reactor there is an area called the
red forest, because after the accident, so

00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:07.350
much radioactive material was dumped in that
area that all the trees died.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:17.769
And their leaves turned red, just like they
do in autumn.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:35.440
I am standing on the stage of the old Pripyat
theater.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.500
There is something about this place that just
... I can picture the scene.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:48.090
I can picture it here: a packed house, all
the great Russian productions that were staged

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.090
here.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:57.610
And you look around at all the old lights
and the layers upon layers of walkways they

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.880
would have used.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.500
This is a pretty amazing location.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.760
This is my favorite place so far, nothing
radioactive.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:06:24.690
It is just an amazing look at the past of
this place.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:31.550
Everything is so recognizable and so familiar
and yet it is being destroyed.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:41.139
It is crumbling and nature is reclaiming this
whole area.

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:47.490
This is what the world would look like if
man disappeared one day all of a sudden.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:07:00.460
This is what it would look like 30 years later.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.770
I filmed this video while shooting a documentary
for TV all about how uranium has shaped the

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:05.950
modern world.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.120
For details about when and where that will
be broadcast, check out the description.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.780
And thank you to everyone for writing in to
request that this be broadcast in your area.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.009
We are working as hard as we can to make that
happen and/or to make it available online,

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:20.729
because I know most of you watch most of your
content online just like I do.

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:22.040
So we will try to make that happen.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.199
You know, I really want to thank you for supporting
me, because I think without your support and

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:30.479
the support of my long time sponsor, Audible.com,
I don't think I would have been selected as

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:32.570
the host for this documentary.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.630
And this is the part where I tell you about
Audible, the leading provider of audio books

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.710
in all areas of literature.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:41.729
It has got hundreds of thousands of titles
in fiction, non-fiction and periodicals.

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:47.600
This week I wanted to recommend to you a fiction
book, which is The Martian by Andy Weir.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.820
If you thought that that was an alien landscape—what
you just saw—imagine what would really happen

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.860
if there was a disaster on another world.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.070
It is an awesome book and will be made into
a movie later this year.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.979
So you probably want to read it or listen
to it before that happens.

00:08:01.979 --> 00:08:06.039
And you can download this book for free by
going to Audible.com/Veritasium or you can

00:08:06.039 --> 00:08:08.740
pick any other book of your choosing for a
one month free trial.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.990
So I really want to thank Audible for supporting
me.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.460
And I want to thank you so much for watching.
