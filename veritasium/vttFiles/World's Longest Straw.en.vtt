00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.860
Hey Nige, can you get me another coke?

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.480
Nah, I'm good, thanks.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.580
It's just downstairs.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.720
Nah, the tennis is on.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.880
You come to my house to watch the tennis and you're not even going to get me another coke?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Yeah, it's the tiebreaker.  Relax.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.320
You know what I wish we had? Like a really long straw so we don't even have to go downstairs to the kitchen.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.660
That would be pretty good. Yeah. Yeah.  Right?

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.740
How long of a straw could we actually make that you could use?

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.420
Downstairs is a bit of a stretch I reckon.  Yeah.  How much is that, like, 3, 4 meters? Do you think we could?

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.740
I reckon we could do it.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.660
We'd need a lot of straws though.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.720
We got a pack here.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.700
Oh, okay.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.180
Now our first test, just to see that Nigel can use a straw properly, we've got about a 1 meter length of straw here.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.380
Think you can suck through that?

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.000
I could give it a go.  So we just taped these drinking straws together, and hopefully

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.300
Yeah, that's alright.  But there's a lot of air coming through I think from the

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.780
The joints in the straw, yeah.  We've gotta come up with some better way to test this out.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.280
I happen to have 6 meters of plastic tubing here.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.000
Non-toxic?

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.180
Uhh, that's what they said at the hardware store.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.620
We're preparing the preliminary tests.  Nigel is lowering some tubing off the balcony.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.060
He actually thinks he's got a shot at sucking through 6 meters of tubing

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.340
I think he's got no chance and he's going to be nowhere close, but

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.540
I think this will allow us to establish how much Nigel actually sucks.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.920
(laughing)

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.640
He's getting ready up there.  He knows there's a lot riding on it.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.780
When you're ready!

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.320
Look at that! Look at that!  Woah, he shoots up!

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.720
He's got 2 meters! He's got three meters!

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.660
Look at that guy go! He's getting 4 meters, 4 meters!

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.220
5! 5 meters! 6!

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.820
Yeah!  (Cheering)

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.820
Now I'm going to try to do the same thing, but the tube I'm using has a thicker diameter.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.660
Mine is about 5 mil, where as Nigel's was 3mil.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.680
So we're going to see if this makes any difference.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:20.040
(Inspiring music)

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.900
Now, I guess the obvious question is, can Nigel do it?

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.000
Yes

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.140
Nigel thinks that's the obvious answer but I'm pretty sure he's going to fail.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.460
Now, maybe what's worth talking about is how a straw works in the first place.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.580
How does it work?

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.160
Yeah, cause this is really just a big bendy straw.  If we look at a smaller version of a straw here

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.960
We should all be familiar with how this works.  Or should we?

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.440
I don't know.  I think most people think you're just sucking the liquid in and swallowing it.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.420
But, you knid of have to think about air pressure.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.900
Yeah, because actually what's happening is that air pressure is causing the, coke in this case, to go up the straw.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.420
Well there's a difference in pressure in the atmospheric pressure and the pressure that you create

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.300
by opening up your lungs and pulling your diaphragm down.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.280
So you reduce the pressure in your mouth, and it's that difference in pressure

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.820
between the atmospheric pressure and the pressure inside you

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.000
which gets that liquid flowing into you.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.820
someone has failed at the 5 mm diameter and you're the next guy to take it on.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.860
You ready for this?

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.640
I am ready.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.580
He's been practicing his whole life for this.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.080
Yeah, you can see it's a strong start.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.880
Strong start from Quan

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.080
You've got it.  Oh, he's going big right here.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.600
You can see there's a lot of determination.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.920
He's getting close, getting close.  Look at this.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.080
Look at this.  Can he do it? Can he do it?

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.060
Ohhhhhh, and he's done it!

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.080
(cheering)

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.680
Agh.  That tastes disgusting.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.100
Yeah I definitely felt like my tounge, while I was trying to suck it up

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.540
was being pulled out into the straw

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.080
(off) I felt the same thing

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.680
But.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.680
And it was tougher, definitely tougher.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:06.820
Well done sir.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.060
Thank you.  Means a lot.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.440
For his next challenge, we're going to try to get him to suck through 10.3 meters

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.580
which is the theoretical maximum, size of straw

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.680
How are you feeling?

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.680
Well, that theoretical maximum, kind of relies on being able to get a perfect vacuum

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.040
and, although I am perfect in a lot of ways, I don't know that I can create a perfect vacuum.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.560
I have often thought that there is actually a perfect vacuum inside Nigel's head

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.220
Today we're going to really find out, won't we?

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.860
Ok, we've got the setup here.  We're down at Tamarama Beach

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.760
And we have 10.5 meters worth of tubing

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.600
Which goes all the way up to Nigel at the very top there.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.940
So I'm going to see if I can relive some of my former glory

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.780
and get the red liquid up this height.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.960
3!  2!  1!

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.640
There you have it.  Nigel is starting to suck on that straw.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.380
There he goes.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.240
Looking strong.  Create that vacuum.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.400
Approaching the edge of the cliff there.  Go, Nigel, Go!

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.840
C'mon, Nigel!

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.240
Doesn't seem to be going anywhere.  We seem a bit stuck.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.260
At that point right there.  You can see the determination, the focus.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.300
Trying to see how high that is

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.420
He's done well

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.280
But it just doesn't look like it's going to happen.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.560
(Music stops, and breaks down. Signalling failure)

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.460
Alright, so Nigel did pretty well there

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.400
We saw that he could get that liquid up the tube about 7 meters.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.160
Not the theoretical maximum of ten meters.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.880
Still more than you.  Just saying.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.740
That's a good point. That's a good point.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.740
If Nigel could have created a perfect vacuum, then the water would have

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.940
gone up to 10.3 meters, according to our calculations.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.000
This is kind of similar to how they used to measure atmospheric pressure in the old days.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.760
by millimeters of mercury.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.780
So atmospheric pressure would push mercury up a tube with  a vacuum at the other end

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.240
760 millimeters.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.780
760 millimeters. So about .76 of a meter.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.900
So you can see why they used mercury and not water

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.740
because if you were doing this with water, you'd need

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.360
a cliff

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.660
yeah, you'd need a ten meter long barometer.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.560
so much better to do it with millimeters of mercury.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.280
and of course now we measure it in kilopascals.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.160
So anyway, well done Nigel.  You really suck.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.280
So how do we work out the maximum length of straw that you could suck through vertically?

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.700
Well think about this.  You place the straw into the liquid.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.880
and you start sucking from the top.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.200
that decreases the pressure at the top

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.680
and the difference in pressure between your mouth and atmospheric pressure

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.720
creates a force that pushes the liquid upwards.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.480
Now that liquid which is in the straw has a weight

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.080
which is equal to the volume of the liquid, times its density, times the gravitational field strength.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.080
so if we set these two forces equal to each other

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.820
you can see that the pressure difference must be equal to the density of fluid

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.540
times its height, times the gravitational field strength

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.600
and if we sub in the numbers, we can see that the maximum height of liquid

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.040
that anyone could lift, even if they created a perfect vacuum inside their mouth

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.340
would be about 10.3 meters.
