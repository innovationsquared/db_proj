00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.880
So the people from the Hunger Games came to me
and they asked me if I wanted to do an experiment

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.200
that would be related to power generation.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.500
And strangely, there is this one idea
that I've been thinking about for years,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.280
and now finally I have the chance to do it.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.780
Come check it out!

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.120
Positions...Here we go...Set...Yeah...Dolly...Lights! and... Action!

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.040
We have a setup here with two rain
shower heads, making two strings of water.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.520
Now each stream is gonna pass through a set of coils
- right up by where they're released -

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.480
and then it passes through this wire mesh down below.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.400
Now these two sets of coils... So this set of coils
is separate from this set of coils.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.360
And they're each connected to one of these bowls here.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.240
Once we get the water flowing, we should be able to generate a little electric spark right here.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.280
There it is...!

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.900
What's incredible is that we're generating a spark,
which is probably five to ten thousand volts.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.300
It would give you a decent little shock.
I mean it's not actually dangerous,

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.060
because, although the voltage is high,
there is not that much charge behind it.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.040
So you can't get that much current flowing.
And current is what does really does damage.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.720
Now the question is: 'how, just out of this setup
where we have falling water and some pieces of metal,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.080
do we generate ten thousand volts?!'

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.720
Well the way it works is that ...
normally water is perfectly neutral;

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.600
there's even numbers of positive ions and negative ions.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.360
But, as the water comes down of these two shower heads, sometimes there's gonna be a slight imbalance;

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.460
maybe a little more negative in this stream
and a little more positive in that stream.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.960
Now normally that just kind of washes out over time...

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.240
But not in this case...!  Here's the ingenious part...

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.560
The mesh on the left is
connected to the ring on the right...

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.620
So, if this mesh becomes
negatively charged, then so does this ring...

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.000
And now that ring will attract
the positively-charged water.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.240
So this whole stream becomes positively charged.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.040
Therefore, when it lands on this mesh,
this mesh becomes positively charged aswell.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.800
Which means this coil over here is positively charged,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.500
forcing the negative ions to
be coming out of this stream more.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.060
And so, what we have is a clear separation of charge.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.100
There's a positively-charged stream on the right,
and a negatively-charged stream on the left.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.940
If you look closely at the streams,
what you can actually see is

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.760
they get more and more attracted to these top coils.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.020
And then the spark goes... and they reset.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.480
So basically, what's happening is
we're building up charge on these coils

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.840
And then, when the charge gets big enough, it jumps across from the negative side to the positive side,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.980
and everything becomes neutral again,
and the charging process can start afresh.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.760
It's a pretty phenomenal piece of physics.
I mean, it's such a basic setup ...

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.180
and yet it produces this very impressive result.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.640
This was noticed over a hundred of years ago
by a guy named Lord Kelvin.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.340
So it's often called or 'Kelvin's Water Dropper',
or 'Lord Kelvin's Rainstorm'.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.020
It's a really impressive phenomenon.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.080
But you might be wondering
'how much energy could I really get out of this system?'

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.960
Well, to put this in perspective, if you were to charge
your phone on the energy generated by this setup,

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.880
it would take six and a half years to reach full charge...

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.500
So this is a very tiny amount of energy
generation that we're talking about.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.860
You know, an interesting thing to consider is
'where does this electrical energy come from?'

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.980
All we really have is just falling water and metal pipes...

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.400
I want you to leave me your answer in the
comments below, or make me a video response.
