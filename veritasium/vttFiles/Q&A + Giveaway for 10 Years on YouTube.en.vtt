00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.680
As of today, I have been making Youtube videos full-time for 10 years

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.310
So to celebrate, I am answering your questions

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:20.540
plus I'm giving away items like this beautiful spinning top from vorso and other items from my videos

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.970
so if you want to win one of those

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.620
then write down the characters that will appear randomly in the top right corner of this video

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.680
Those will be your password to the form in the description

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.910
so let's get into it

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.620
Why did you start doing youtube?

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.570
because I always wanted to be a filmmaker

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.370
As a kid, I loved doing plays and musicals

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.970
I had the most fun of my life when I was working with creative other people

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.680
but I always thought that a career in the traditional film or tv industry was a terrible idea

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.310
and like your life was out of your control

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.420
It seemed to rely on a big break; I don't think those industries were meritocracies

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.860
so for basically my whole life until I was 28, I did the safe thing

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.690
And I studied engineering and physics

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.940
and did a PhD in physics and then I taught people physics

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.000
and I love science

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.400
but I also love just the craft of putting together a film or a video and sending it out into the world

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.970
and I think this makes a lot of sense

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.560
because I liked learning about science, and I liked performing

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.300
and that is exactly what making Youtube videos allows me to do

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.310
You know the process of doing science is very different from the process of learning science

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.440
uh and so I think it's not surprising that this is the thing that I love more than being a scientist

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.700
I have been on Youtube for 10 years and it was starting to show. There was so much gray in my beard

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.650
that uh i'm shaving it off to wind back the clock

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.720
I am giving away this fully specked 2017 macbook pro

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.670
I used this to make a lot of my videos

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.590
but those are all wiped off here now

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.050
so it's just a nicely specced laptop

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.530
that you could use to make more videos if you wanted

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.450
Any advice you have for people coming out of high school or college and unsure how to take their first steps?

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.690
the key is just start doing it

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.800
after making my Youtube channel for a few months

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.720
I sort of snuck into a science awards in sydney and australia

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.200
And there I found sort of the executive producer of the only science show on Australian television

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.020
and I got his business card

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.160
And the very next day, I emailed him

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.880
And I sent him links to all of the videos, or you know, the videos I was most proud of anyway

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.150
And uh I didn't really expect to hear anything

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.530
but three weeks later I got an email back from him

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.480
and he was like, these are really good why don't you come in and we'll have a chat

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.440
and I think the key to that interaction was

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.010
I had stuff to show him

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.200
I didn't go to him and say, "Hey I'd love to be involved in your TV program."

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.990
you know what can I do for you? What do you need done? You know?

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.010
I came to him and I said that's what I'm capable of

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.710
and if if that's of interest to you, then great

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.870
I have literally thousands of penrose tiles

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.790
that I will be sending out, if you want them, I'm giving these away.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.860
I will send you 21 kites and then 13 darts of another color

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.530
What has been the hardest part of your Youtube journey?

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.900
I would say the beginning

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.600
You know, everything's like a snowball

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.480
It's always hardest to make the snowball when it's small

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.280
and I know that there were a number of times when I thought that I would just quit doing youtube

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.120
because it seemed like I was getting no traction

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.360
I think the other problem with the beginning was, I wasn't very good at Youtube

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.730
I wasn't very good at presenting to a camera

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.780
I wasn't very good at picking topics

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.200
Most people know how to tell apart a

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.960
。。。

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.580
a hard-boiled egg from a raw egg

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.460
。。。

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.830
Well you're gonna find out pretty quick if you uh if you break the shell

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.650
I've said it before and I'll say it again

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.390
I think I was lucky not to know how bad I was

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.300
because otherwise I really would have stopped in the early days

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.680
I am giving away these Ames windows

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.460
All lovingly handcrafted by me

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.050
painstakingly over hours and hours colored in beautiful

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.960
gopro hero4

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.920
still works a little old

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.690
Do your kids watch your videos?

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:53.820
Some of them

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.360
uh their favorites are the one where

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.850
daddy quote "blasts off into space"

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.480
and also the one where the meteor hits the earth

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.320
I actually feel like the kids are a good barometer of what's gonna be successful

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.170
It's like if it appeals to their two and four-year-old brains

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.090
then it will appeal to all of us in some way

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.720
I'm giving away these astronaut shoes which are size 8 US or 41 in Europe

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.210
the salt lamp from negative ions

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.770
these platonic solids there should be five of them

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.010
What was the most humbling response you got from the audience and for which video?

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.240
uh depends on what you mean by humbling

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.760
In like Brady Haran has ruined this word for me

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.240
but if you mean like the most overwhelming positive response that I've gotten

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.960
You know, I would say I did this video on the bullet block years ago

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.800
and there were over a hundred video responses

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.290
which just totally blew me away

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.450
the one-way speed of light video

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.640
got a huge response from people

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.920
there's over 50,000 comments on that video

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.560
not to mention the hundreds of emails I received and the tweets

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:11.120
and it's incredible to have hundreds and thousands of people thinking about science

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.570
and the fundamental way that the universe works

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.400
I am delighted that you guys are with me

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.600
What do you do apart from Youtube?

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:33.640
Well, I have three kids and they take up most of the time outside of when I'm doing Youtube videos

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.180
so that's it I'm a Youtuber and a dad

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.250
Which is pretty great

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.500
I love going to the beach

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.210
I love hiking up the hill, I love riding our bikes

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.460
I'm a pretty simple guy

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.580
and 2020 has made things even simpler

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.360
because there was really nothing we could do

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.690
the last shade balls

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.440
All right. What would you say was the hardest part of your PhD?

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.360
Okay so the hardest part of a PhD is that it's this research degree, right?

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.890
Which maybe is stating the obvious

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.680
when I got into it I remember

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.880
talking to someone who had recently finished their PhD and she told me

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.840
a PhD is a dark time in most people's lives

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.370
and I was like,

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.890
what did I get myself into

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.300
but I realized what she meant

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:24.060
because for three or four years I was kind of on this roller coaster

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.160
the problem with research is you never quite know what you're doing

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.780
that's the point of research and you never quite know what you're gonna find

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.200
so there's a big risk that it's all gonna be worthless

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.640
that you're gonna spend six months or a year or many years depending on your field

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.280
working on something and only to find out that it didn't work

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.010
or it's not gonna happen

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:49.330
and for me that is a very hard thing to do

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.900
I feel like my personality is not built for that kind of research

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.240
because I need sort of to regularly achieve things

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.210
and to feel like i'm doing practical things

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.690
and having a practical impact on the world

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.160
what was the best part of it?

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.120
getting to meet lots of academics and talk to different people

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.620
My thesis supervisor Manjula Sharma was fantastic

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:15.580
and I learned a ton about academia, and about research, and about writing

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.250
it was a real nice shift for me to go into a PhD

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:23.000
that was not solely focused on math you know coming out of engineering physics

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.420
it was nice to be focused on something that involved words and writing and reading

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.880
and I realized, oh that whole area of life has been kind of shut off to me

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.040
as an engineering student, so that was a nice transition

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.410
What was the most unexpected part of it?

00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:42.530
well I gotta say that was having more people than just my thesis reviewers

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.800
which are three people read my thesis

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.800
and the reason for it was, I went out and made videos

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.660
You know, about my PhD research

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.340
and uh it's funny that a Youtube video

00:08:54.340 --> 00:09:00.300
is the thing that these days can get your thesis or your papers more citations and better read

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:05.560
In 2010 I made this short video for tedx in Sydney

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.330
and I initially shot it like talking to camera

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.260
and when I got home all the footage was corrupted and I couldn't use it

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.690
it was the night before the submission deadline

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:18.100
and so I drew stick figures in paint

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.010
ask almost anyone about physics

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:23.930
and chances are they will tell you they don't like it, don't get it, or it's just not their thing

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.400
and I feel like that's still one of my the best things that I've done

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:34.180
Which is like, there are tons of times when it seems like you should be discouraged and throw in the towel

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.060
but I did not

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.820
I just made do with the crappy tools that I had

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:44.780
and frankly I think the video was better with the stupid stick figures than it would have been with a talking head

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:51.930
Okay the garage gets full of.. stuff

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:56.690
these are boxes of the Snatoms expansion kit

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:00.090
and I want to sign them and send them out to teachers

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:04.540
so teachers use your school emails uh in the form

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:08.290
and  will send you one of these if you're lucky

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:12.240
okay lightning round why does Veritasium have 42 mass number

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.610
because that's the answer to the ultimate question of life the universe and everything from the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:18.680
How are you doing?

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.170
well

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.770
What's your favorite ice cream flavor?

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:22.610
pistachio or rocky road

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:26.120
Do you truly love turbulent flow or do you just fake it for the internet?

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.280
。。。

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.000
Merch?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:28.940
I don't have any

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:29.740
Would you like some?

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.890
some did you learn any Portuguese with your wife?

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.220
um bocadinho

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.130
She hates the way I say "bacalhau"

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.530
I find it impossible

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.250
Science or maths?

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:38.840
science

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.130
Do you miss Canada?

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.460
Yes. Today especially

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.980
Favorite shrek character?

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:44.490
Shrek

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:45.690
Is a hot dog a sandwich?

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:46.780
。。。

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.460
How much do you love science?

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:49.440
to the moon and back

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.340
How many hours of sleep do you get

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.530
Not enough. Not.. Enough

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:55.930
If not youtube, what would you be today?

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.370
I think probably a teacher of some sort, maybe a professor

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.700
How big is your team?

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.900
because the production value of your videos has been so awesome these days

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.370
well thank you for noticing

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.690
and yes there has been a team being built

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:16.820
Johnny Hyman who can animate edit write music, write programs

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.290
He's also working on a channel of his own called verse you should check it out

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.260
My wife Raquel is frequently behind the camera

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.300
I'm so incredibly appreciative of that

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.600
thank you thank you thank you

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.050
Yvonne Tello is my animator

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:33.240
He's been doing lots of great work in all sorts of different styles

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.320
Peter Lebedev who's been helping me with research and writing

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.140
and doing everything that possibly needs doing

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.570
My former professor of general relativity at the university of Sydney

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:46.040
Grant Lewis has been an advisor on many of these videos

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.540
a huge thank you to Alice

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.250
for managing everything that's happening in Chinese Veritasium

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.920
There's Veritasium dubbed in spanish

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.920
in arabic, in russian,

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.120
We're working on a Veritasium hindi

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.580
and I gotta say paying people would not really be possible without the sponsors

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.970
so I gotta say thank you for being okay with it,

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:07.570
because that's what allowed me to have a rocket built

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.930
or build an eight foot tall optical illusion

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.450
those are things I just never would have dreamed of doing in the past

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:18.080
because my investment in every video was essentially only my time

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.600
and now I feel like I can try lots of different things

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:26.010
so this is a q&amp;a video but the final q is for you

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:32.090
Which is, what do you want to see more of on this channel in 2021 and in the future?

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.520
What have you enjoyed the most in the past?

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.170
I just want to know what I can do for you

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:40.380
what is the thing that really adds the most value to your life

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.930
uh that's it for me

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:46.380
I guess, thank you seriously thank you
