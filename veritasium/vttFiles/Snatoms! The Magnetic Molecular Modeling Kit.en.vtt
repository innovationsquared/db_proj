00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.420
Imagine this is an hydrogen atom.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.780
This, is another one,

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.480
and then this is H2, the hydrogen molecule.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.200
You can break it apart, add an oxygen atom and make H2Oâ€”water.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.800
A carbon with four hydrogens, that is methane.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.820
And you can actually combine it with water to make: methanol.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.440
These are Snatoms, The Magnetic Molecular Modeling Kit.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.040
And I am Derek Muller, the creator of a Youtube channel called Veritasium,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.380
which has nearly 3 million suscribers.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.240
Through my videos, I teach science virtually to millions of people around the world.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.800
But some things are best learned hands-on.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.240
Like chemistry. I mean, atoms are impossible to see

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.300
and chemical notation can be very confusing for students.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.780
And that is why, as a teacher for 7 years before I started Veritasium,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.880
I've always wished that something like this existed.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.640
Snatoms are an improvement over ball-and-stick models for three reasons:

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.680
1) They're quicker to put together and break apart,

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.240
2) Plus, they're a better representation of what a molecule actually looks like.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.240
I mean, bonds are not sticks. They are overlapping electron orbitals.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.040
3) And most important, Snatoms allow you to feel the attraction between atoms.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.220
And that helps break the misconception that bonds store energy.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.520
This is something that I talked to Hank Green about on SciShow Talk Show.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.420
Derek: Where is the energy coming from?

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.720
Hank: The bonds, man.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.320
Derek: But my concern is this, right? If you think that there really is energy in bonds,

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.920
Hank: Yup.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.880
Derek: Then you would imagine something like breaking those bonds open

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.380
releases that energy.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.880
Hank: Right.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.920
Derek: Which is totally false!

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.980
Hank: That is true.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.400
Derek: This is my point!

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.060
(laughter)

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.200
Derek: It's the formation of bonds that releases energy,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.580
and it's the breaking of bonds which takes energy.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.240
With Snatoms, you can easily feel the work you need to do to break a bond, and you

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.460
can hear the energy released when a new bond forms. [click]

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.500
I've been developing Snatoms for over two years.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.700
The first prototypes I made out of Styrofoam balls that I cut and put magnets in.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.060
You may have seen this picture on my Instagram.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.740
Then I made drawings for the project and had them 3D printed

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.260
And then I created some injection molded prototypes

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.820
which I spray-painted and used in my video ''5 Fun Physics Phenomena''

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.180
Now I need your help to make this project a reality.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.580
Veritasium has showed me that there are millions of people out there passionate

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.820
about helping others understand science.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.920
So if you agree with me that this would help and Snatoms should exist in the world,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.000
then help me fund the production molds and magnets required to make this happen.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.680
A basic Snatoms kit would include

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.780
6 carbon atoms, 6 oxygens

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.520
and 12 hydrogens.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.880
That's all the atoms you need to make glucose, the basic sugar molecule.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.880
But of course with this building blocks you can build

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.580
hundreds of other molecules.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.060
And I will make some video guides explaining how to use Snatoms

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.540
to learn about molecules, chemical bonding, geometry

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.680
and balancing equations.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.580
And, if we reach a stretch target I will add another element to the kit,

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.020
like nitrogen. Plus if we reach a further stretch target I will build an app

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.480
that will gamify the process of learning, allowing users to learn

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.680
about new molecules and capture their progress.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.180
I think the best way to learn science is hands-on from a young age,

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.320
and if you want to help me make this happen, then support this Kickstarter.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.200
You don't have to buy a set of Snatoms (though that definitely would help)

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.780
But if you think is a good idea just share it with your friends on Twitter or Facebook.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.380
I really appreciate your support and I look forward to helping the world

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.840
learn science physically in addition to through the internet.
