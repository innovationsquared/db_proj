00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.240
I am a sun sneezer. Which is also known as having the photic sneeze reflex

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.700
Or, the autosomal dominant compelling helio ophthalmic outbursts syndrome.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.460
Which basically means if I go from a dark area into somewhere that's brightly lit -  You know, like, looking at the sun - I will sneeze.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.430
Wait for it...

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.529
There you go, I'm a sun sneezer.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.340
But why does this happen?

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.379
People have known about this effect for at least a few thousand years

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.150
Aristotle was probably a sun sneezer because in his book of problems

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.080
he asked: Why does the sun provoke sneezing?

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.420
And his answer was it was the heat from the sun which causes

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.300
sweating inside your nose, and so you sneeze to get rid of the moisture.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.260
but a couple millennia later

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.379
Sir Francis Bacon demonstrated that this could not be the case because when he closed his eyes and turned towards the sun

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.619
well he did not experience that photic sneeze reflex so his explanation was that it was the eyes

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.599
watering and then when some of that moisture got down into the nose that caused the tickle which makes you sneeze

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.809
but even this theory has its problems because eye watering is a much slower process than the photic sneeze reflex

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.420
So it can't be the cause. Before I started researching sun sneezing

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.460
I thought that having the photic sneeze reflex

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.480
Must Convey some sort of evolutionary advantage under the people who have it. If you think about it

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.889
Sneezing is a way of transmitting disease. In your snot there can be the living Bacteria that cause

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:00.290
Tuberculosis, and strep throat or viruses that cause measles mumps Rubella and influenza, so if you're living in a moist dark cave

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.290
and you sneeze

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.849
Where your snot lands on the floor or the walls of the cave and those Pathogens can stay alive for hours or even days

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.678
increasing the Likelihood of spreading that disease to other people who live with you in your cave

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.879
Whereas if you only sneeze when you emerge from the darkness of the cave and into bright sunlight

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.089
Well, then that mucus will quickly dry out or because it's exposed to the harmful UV rays of the sun

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.120
It will kill all of those pathogens

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.140
Greatly decreasing the risk of spread of disease

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.200
By the 1960s some studies were revealing the hereditary nature of the photic sneeze reflex

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:43.729
There was a father who would sneeze two times when he entered bright sunlight

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.629
And when they tested his baby daughter who was just four weeks old

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.769
Moving her from a dark room into full sunlight also caused her to sneeze

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.299
Exactly two times and by the 1980s it was clear that this trait was

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.600
autosomal dominant

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.320
Meaning that you only needed to inherit one

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.099
Copy of the Gene from just one of your parents in order to exhibit the trait

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:12.170
But when studies the population have been done only about 18 to 35 percent of people actually have the photic sneeze reflex

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:19.760
So I don't really think this gives a great evolutionary advantage, otherwise everyone would have it

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.200
you know it could just be one of those random mutations that happens over time and

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.670
Sustains itself because it's neither good nor bad evolutionarily speaking

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.340
So it affects roughly one in four people

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.339
Can you spot the person with the photic sneeze reflex?

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.920
Nowadays, it's actually been found that the gene responsible for the photic sneeze reflex is on the second chromosome

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.239
And it's a single letter of DNA that's been changed, on my second chromosome

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.480
I have a C

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:55.009
Where non sun sneezers have a T, and the reason that we know this is that back in 2010 there was a study of about

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.529
10,000 people where they went online and they

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.309
Reported whether they were sun sneezers or not and then their DNA was

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:08.270
analyzed and the groups were compared and what they found was the thing the sun sneezers had in common was this one particular

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.820
letter change in their DNA.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.430
That I think is pretty amazing.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:21.080
Now it's unclear exactly how this change affects your physiology and makes you more susceptible to sun sneezes

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.440
But the best theory at the moment is that it involves the trigeminal nerve which is the largest cranial nerve it

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.489
Involves all of the feeling that you have in your face and as the name implies

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.670
It actually has three branches one of which receives stimuli from your eye and another which receives stimuli from your nose

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.999
so the thought is that this really active stimulation of the optic nerve may cross over into the

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.450
maxillary Branch causing that little tickle which gets you to sneeze

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:55.100
Photic Sneezes are generally pretty harmless unless you're doing something like flying a fighter jet or performing some sort of delicate surgery.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.280
But this methodology,

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:04.619
can allow us to learn a lot about different heritable traits and diseases just by studying lots of people and their genotypes

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:16.499
This episode of veritasium was supported by 23andme. Which is actually the company that figured out that gene polymorphism

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.139
responsible for the photic Sneeze reflex

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:25.289
the name of the Company 23andme comes from the fact that humans actually have 23 pairs of chromosomes and

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:29.249
The purpose of the company is to give people insight into their own DNA

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:32.099
So what you do is spit into a vial

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.309
which is actually much harder than it sounds and

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:39.659
Send it off to them and of course in your saliva are some of the cells from your mouth

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:41.789
They analyze the DNA from those cells

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:46.679
And then they send you a report where you can find out tons of stuff about your genes like

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:53.340
Where do your genes come from that is what's your ancestry and do you have the photic sneeze reflex? Do we share the same?

00:05:54.279 --> 00:06:01.559
Change of DNA on our second chromosome you can also learn about your health and other physical traits and how much

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.239
Neanderthal you are so if you want to learn more about your genotype

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:12.299
Then you should go to 23andme.com/veritasium, so I want to thank 23andme for supporting me

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.400
And, I want to thank you for watching.
