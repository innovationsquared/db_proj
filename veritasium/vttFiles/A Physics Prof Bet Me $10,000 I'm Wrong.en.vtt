00:00:00.038 --> 00:00:03.619
I am here to sign a
document betting $10,000

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:07.950
that my last video is in fact, correct.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.380
This is the video in question.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.620
Some people may have missed it,

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.140
but in this car, there is
no motor, no batteries,

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.170
no energy source, besides the wind itself.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.370
And the counterintuitive claim,

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.320
is that this car can maintain speeds

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.100
faster than the wind that's pushing it.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.480
There is a physics professor at UCLA,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.620
who got in touch, to say that
he thought that I was wrong,

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.800
that the explanation was wrong.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.300
You know, we went back
and forth a little bit,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.907
and eventually I said,

00:00:36.907 --> 00:00:40.121
"Well, how about we bet $10,000?

00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:41.747
"I can prove it to you.

00:00:41.747 --> 00:00:45.490
"This vehicle really can go
downwind faster than the wind."

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.490
And to my surprise, he is
taking me up on the bet.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.249
- Look, no one is perfect,

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:53.560
but you have a much lower error rate

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.550
than most people on
YouTube, in YouTube Space.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.000
- Now, Professor Alex
Kusenko wanted this wager

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.330
and all related discourse to be public.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.230
In fact, he suggested we get a celebrity

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.480
to witness the signing.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.980
So I asked Neil deGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.750
and Sean Carroll to be our witnesses.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.580
And they graciously agreed.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.510
- And Alex, I just wanna say,

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.540
I agree with everything
you said about Veritasium.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.730
That generally I can watch it

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.670
and not have to wonder,
is he gonna mess up?

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.503
How am I gonna-

00:01:22.503 --> 00:01:24.650
- No, he's brilliant, no, he's brilliant.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.960
- I'm excited about this bet,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.312
because if I am wrong, then I wanna know.

00:01:28.312 --> 00:01:31.340
Like the whole point of the
channel is to get to the truth.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.670
And that is, I think why
we're all here today.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.503
And I think, you know,

00:01:34.503 --> 00:01:36.390
this is a great chance to sort of see.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.132
I'm going to summarize Alex's
main points in this video,

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:41.970
but I'll put his full presentation here.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.020
- So let me first explain
what I see in the video.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.840
In the video, the vehicle
is operated in a gusty wind.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.430
Initially, you have the wind
speed exceeding the car speed,

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.110
but then the wind speed is not constant.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.360
The wind speed drops, and
the car moves by inertia

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.510
with deceleration for awhile.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.640
- So, basically Alex thinks a gust

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.240
pushes the car to a high speed.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.590
And then when the wind dies,

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.390
the car is going faster
than the wind momentarily,

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.480
but it must be slowing down.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.850
- In fact, that will be my conclusion

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.330
at the end of this presentation,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.900
that whenever you have
velocity faster than the wind,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.648
I'll actually show you in an equation,

00:02:20.648 --> 00:02:22.030
the acceleration is negative.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.560
The second effect is that
the wind in the video

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.000
is measured at the height

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.050
of about a meter or a meter and a half.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.400
But the propeller goes
to some three meters

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.233
above the ground.

00:02:33.233 --> 00:02:35.240
- Now, due to interactions
with the ground,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.090
there is a wind gradient.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.350
Wind travels slower, close to the ground,

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.310
and then faster, higher up.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.590
Now, Alex estimated that the
wind speed of the propeller

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.140
might be 10 or 15% higher
than at the tell-tale.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.430
So it's possible that
the car could be moving

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.145
slower than the wind at the propeller,

00:02:51.145 --> 00:02:53.681
and yet appear to be
moving faster than the wind

00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:55.460
at the height of the tell-tale.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.890
- Now, I think that
this is a small effect.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.360
However, in combination
with the previous effect,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.152
it just can make this more frequent, okay.

00:03:03.152 --> 00:03:04.950
And that completes-

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.760
- Alex, if I remember the video correctly,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.820
Derek reports that they've achieved

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.920
up to 2.8 times wind speed.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.310
That feels much higher
than what is possible here,

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.060
unless the wind had picked up

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.639
and then spontaneously sort of dropped.

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:22.900
- Very, very good question.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.360
Okay, if you're going for the record,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.970
you probably will do many attempts.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.947
You will be sampling that gusty wind

00:03:29.947 --> 00:03:32.150
over, and over, and over,

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.430
until you set the record, right?

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.613
That's how you set the record.

00:03:34.613 --> 00:03:37.400
And on one of those occasions,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.021
you will get a nice strong gust,

00:03:39.021 --> 00:03:43.020
which is three times the air
that comes after it, okay?

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.550
And that's when you will clock the record.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.730
And that's where that
2.8 factor will come in.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.680
- So what about the treadmill tests?

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.144
These are conducted in still air.

00:03:53.144 --> 00:03:55.430
By moving the ground backwards,

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.770
you're simulating a
perfectly steady tailwind.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.800
And if you hold the car
stationary on the treadmill,

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.550
well, that's equivalent to the
car going exactly wind speed.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.730
Now, if the car can move
forward on the treadmill,

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.100
that shows it can accelerate
faster than the wind.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.684
But Alex had multiple explanations,

00:04:14.684 --> 00:04:17.440
why these experiments don't actually show

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.050
what they claim to show.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:24.050
- If you have this fluctuating
speed of the treadmill,

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.040
and then if a human
just sort of steers it,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.390
it then can introduce unconsciously,

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.880
a bias towards the desired result.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.550
- So, would it any be that
the guy with the spork

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.190
is inducing the model craft

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.837
to go across the lane now and then?

00:04:40.837 --> 00:04:44.926
And as you pointed out, I
would go downhill now and then.

00:04:44.926 --> 00:04:47.840
- Yeah, I'm sure, I'm
a hundred percent sure

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.840
that the guy in the video
doesn't do it on purpose, okay.

00:04:53.256 --> 00:04:57.585
However, you know, if he
is expecting forward drift-

00:04:57.585 --> 00:04:58.696
- Yeah, oh he's trying.

00:04:58.696 --> 00:05:01.750
- Yeah, yeah absolutely,
that's exactly, okay,

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.870
so there you go.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.940
- In the absence of convincing
experimental evidence,

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.280
Alex turned to theoretical analyses,

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.500
like one by MIT Aero
Professor, Mark Drela.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.210
But here too, he found problems.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.610
His main concern is that
the equation for net force

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.350
includes the difference
between the speeds of the car

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.890
and the wind in the denominator.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.480
Which seems to imply that when
traveling exactly wind speed,

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.600
you should get infinite force.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.410
- Now, here's the real danger.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.310
Because if Derek drives
very close to the wind,

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.530
that difference in speed goes to zero.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.200
If it's one millionth of one percent,

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.590
that's like a nuclear
bomb exploding behind him.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.620
Then Derek is definitely
in trouble, right?

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.960
So we need to find something
to save Derek's life here.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.047
This is serious, right?

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:50.850
- But dividing by zero, come on, you guys.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:51.969
I never looked at that.

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:54.244
- [Derek] Alex performed his own analysis,

00:05:54.244 --> 00:05:57.750
and found no such divide by zero problems.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.020
In fact, he found there's
no way for the car

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.260
to accelerate at, or above wind speed.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.380
- The acceleration of
this craft is negative.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.150
So when we, you know,

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.360
so it's possible to move the
craft faster than the wind,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.110
but it's not possible to
move it at zero acceleration

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.640
which would be needed to
maintain constant speed.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.390
- [Derek] That is
basically where we left it.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.240
- That is right.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.653
- Okay, thank you, thank you, Neil.

00:06:20.653 --> 00:06:21.486
Thank you very much.

00:06:21.486 --> 00:06:22.433
- Thanks guys, thanks Neil.

00:06:22.433 --> 00:06:25.593
- So now it was up to me to
convince Professor Kusenko

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:28.666
that Blackbird really can
go faster than the wind,

00:06:31.598 --> 00:06:33.077
When I posted about it on Twitter,

00:06:33.077 --> 00:06:35.744
Alice Zhang, who runs
Chinese Veritasium, said,

00:06:35.744 --> 00:06:37.658
"I think you lost Derek.

00:06:37.658 --> 00:06:40.228
I'm 80% on Alex's side now."

00:06:40.228 --> 00:06:41.822
What's amazing to me, is
that neither one of them

00:06:41.822 --> 00:06:45.268
had seen my attempts to replicate
the treadmill experiments.

00:06:45.268 --> 00:06:47.848
For the first video, I asked
my friend and YouTube maker,

00:06:47.848 --> 00:06:50.965
Xyla Foxlin, to make
a model downwind cart.

00:06:50.965 --> 00:06:52.881
- All right.
(wheels screeching)

00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:54.080
(laughing)

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.038
- [Man] Oh, no!

00:06:55.038 --> 00:06:57.228
- Version one ended in failure,

00:06:57.228 --> 00:06:59.068
but Xyla was undeterred,

00:06:59.068 --> 00:07:01.887
coming back in a couple
of days with version two.

00:07:01.887 --> 00:07:03.158
- Is it feeling like it's gonna...?

00:07:03.158 --> 00:07:06.748
- Unlike these models, most
of her projects actually work.

00:07:06.748 --> 00:07:08.428
She is determined.

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:10.148
So maybe this tells us something

00:07:10.148 --> 00:07:11.368
about whether you can

00:07:11.368 --> 00:07:14.678
actually go faster than
the wind, downwind.

00:07:14.678 --> 00:07:17.518
What was clear to me is that
I didn't do a good enough job

00:07:17.518 --> 00:07:20.268
in the first video,
explaining how Blackbird works

00:07:20.268 --> 00:07:21.625
and providing convincing evidence

00:07:21.625 --> 00:07:24.138
that it can really go faster than the wind

00:07:24.138 --> 00:07:25.548
in a sustained way.

00:07:25.548 --> 00:07:27.428
In my defense, I thought the concept

00:07:27.428 --> 00:07:29.188
was well enough established.

00:07:29.188 --> 00:07:31.648
Way back in 1969, Andrew Bauer

00:07:31.648 --> 00:07:34.096
build the first successful downwind cart.

00:07:34.096 --> 00:07:37.408
And he did it to settle a friendly wager

00:07:37.408 --> 00:07:39.768
with Aero Engineer, Apolo Smith.

00:07:39.768 --> 00:07:42.378
The bet was inspired by a
claim in a students paper

00:07:42.378 --> 00:07:44.138
from 20 years earlier.

00:07:44.138 --> 00:07:45.918
Now, Rick Cavallaro,
the builder of Blackbird

00:07:45.918 --> 00:07:47.378
was completely unaware of all this

00:07:47.378 --> 00:07:49.548
until after he built his cart.

00:07:49.548 --> 00:07:51.518
But other analysis have been published

00:07:51.518 --> 00:07:54.016
under names like the
push-me pull-you boat.

00:07:54.016 --> 00:07:56.938
So I didn't honestly
think anyone would doubt

00:07:56.938 --> 00:08:00.908
the vehicles operation,
much less bet me $10,000.

00:08:00.908 --> 00:08:04.038
But clearly, there is a need
for a deeper explanation.

00:08:04.038 --> 00:08:06.678
So I want to do that now
by responding to the points

00:08:06.678 --> 00:08:07.778
Alex raised.

00:08:07.778 --> 00:08:10.138
So first, let's deal with wind gradient.

00:08:10.138 --> 00:08:11.358
I mean, why didn't we measure

00:08:11.358 --> 00:08:12.876
the speed of the wind higher up?

00:08:12.876 --> 00:08:16.178
Well, the answer is because
it's already been done.

00:08:16.178 --> 00:08:18.308
They mounted tell-tales on fishing poles

00:08:18.308 --> 00:08:21.248
out to the sides of the
propeller and even above it.

00:08:21.248 --> 00:08:23.861
Now, although the lowest
tell-tale flips back first,

00:08:23.861 --> 00:08:27.098
all of the tell-tales do
eventually flip backwards

00:08:27.098 --> 00:08:28.892
showing that every part of the vehicle

00:08:28.892 --> 00:08:31.508
is going faster than the wind.

00:08:31.508 --> 00:08:33.518
Could this be because of a big wind gust

00:08:33.518 --> 00:08:36.897
that pushed the car up to high
speed and then the wind died?

00:08:36.897 --> 00:08:38.488
I don't think so.

00:08:38.488 --> 00:08:40.598
Even though I didn't have
a speedometer in the car

00:08:40.598 --> 00:08:42.898
for my runs, someone
on Twitter pointed out

00:08:42.898 --> 00:08:45.128
that we could use the
rotation of the back wheel

00:08:45.128 --> 00:08:47.778
to determine the speed
from the video footage.

00:08:47.778 --> 00:08:50.442
This shows that even after
the tell-tale flips backwards,

00:08:50.442 --> 00:08:52.711
the car keeps accelerating.

00:08:54.148 --> 00:08:55.818
Another thing I want to point out is that,

00:08:55.818 --> 00:08:57.498
if wind gradient or gusts

00:08:57.498 --> 00:09:00.058
were the reason that the car
travels faster than the wind,

00:09:00.058 --> 00:09:02.828
well, you'd expect the
tell-tale to jump around

00:09:02.828 --> 00:09:05.808
or at least not point straight back at me.

00:09:05.808 --> 00:09:08.019
But it consistently
does for over 30 seconds

00:09:08.019 --> 00:09:09.608
until I had to hit the brakes

00:09:09.608 --> 00:09:12.278
to avoid crashing into parked vehicles.

00:09:12.278 --> 00:09:13.908
But if that's not enough for you,

00:09:13.908 --> 00:09:15.928
when Blackbird achieved its record speed

00:09:15.928 --> 00:09:20.288
of 27.7 miles per hour in a
10 mile per hour tail wind,

00:09:20.288 --> 00:09:22.248
it was still accelerating.

00:09:22.248 --> 00:09:23.668
And we know this because

00:09:23.668 --> 00:09:27.118
there were multiple GPS units
in the car and wind speeds

00:09:27.118 --> 00:09:29.248
which were measured at the
height of the propeller

00:09:29.248 --> 00:09:31.198
at multiple locations.

00:09:31.198 --> 00:09:32.598
The highlighted section shows

00:09:32.598 --> 00:09:34.038
the ten second measurement period

00:09:34.038 --> 00:09:36.738
over which the record was set.

00:09:36.738 --> 00:09:40.768
Also in 2013, the U.S Physics
Olympiad Semifinal Exam

00:09:40.768 --> 00:09:42.708
asked questions about Blackbird.

00:09:42.708 --> 00:09:47.198
Like, can it go faster than
the wind downwind and upwind?

00:09:47.198 --> 00:09:50.408
The solution says, both
modes are possible.

00:09:50.408 --> 00:09:52.723
And with sufficiently low energy loss,

00:09:52.723 --> 00:09:55.498
any speed is possible.

00:09:55.498 --> 00:09:57.108
Now, I'll admit that the evidence

00:09:57.108 --> 00:09:59.903
I showed in the first
video was not definitive

00:09:59.903 --> 00:10:01.624
when gusts or gradients

00:10:01.624 --> 00:10:04.468
could have explained the observations.

00:10:04.468 --> 00:10:06.398
But now that you've seen this evidence,

00:10:06.398 --> 00:10:08.728
are you convinced that
Blackbird can go downwind

00:10:08.728 --> 00:10:11.468
faster than the wind without slowing down?

00:10:11.468 --> 00:10:14.848
Well, Professor Kusenko was not convinced.

00:10:14.848 --> 00:10:17.588
So I wanna explain how
the car works so clearly

00:10:17.588 --> 00:10:19.638
that no one, not even the professor,

00:10:19.638 --> 00:10:21.638
can doubt what's going on.

00:10:21.638 --> 00:10:22.471
The first thing to know,

00:10:22.471 --> 00:10:25.148
is that the propeller doesn't
work like most people think.

00:10:25.148 --> 00:10:26.750
It's not working like a windmill.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:30.158
It doesn't turn the way
the tailwind is pushing it.

00:10:30.158 --> 00:10:32.568
Instead, it turns in
the opposite direction,

00:10:32.568 --> 00:10:35.538
working like a fan to push air backwards.

00:10:35.538 --> 00:10:37.598
This fan is powered by the wheels,

00:10:37.598 --> 00:10:40.328
which are connected to the
propeller by a bike chain.

00:10:40.328 --> 00:10:42.988
So at wind speed, the
car can keep accelerating

00:10:42.988 --> 00:10:46.138
because the wheels turn the
fan, which blows air back,

00:10:46.138 --> 00:10:48.448
generating forward thrust.

00:10:48.448 --> 00:10:50.798
Now the big question is, to drive the fan,

00:10:50.798 --> 00:10:53.188
there must be a backwards
force on the wheels,

00:10:53.188 --> 00:10:55.138
which tends to slow them down.

00:10:55.138 --> 00:10:57.898
So why isn't this force bigger

00:10:57.898 --> 00:10:59.348
than the thrust from the propeller

00:10:59.348 --> 00:11:01.908
causing the car to slow down overall?

00:11:01.908 --> 00:11:03.238
Well, the answer is,

00:11:03.238 --> 00:11:06.298
the wheels are going so
much faster over the ground

00:11:06.298 --> 00:11:08.358
than the propeller is
moving through the air.

00:11:08.358 --> 00:11:10.918
So the thrust force
can actually be larger.

00:11:10.918 --> 00:11:12.248
I'm gonna do an analysis

00:11:12.248 --> 00:11:14.398
in the frame of reference of the car.

00:11:14.398 --> 00:11:16.088
And the important equation to know is,

00:11:16.088 --> 00:11:18.778
power equals force times velocity.

00:11:18.778 --> 00:11:21.838
So at the wheels, power
is input into the system

00:11:21.838 --> 00:11:24.518
by the ground moving underneath the car.

00:11:24.518 --> 00:11:27.067
The power generated is the force
of the ground on the wheels

00:11:27.067 --> 00:11:29.671
times the velocity of the car.

00:11:30.678 --> 00:11:33.048
At the propeller, work is done on the air,

00:11:33.048 --> 00:11:35.428
as the propeller pushes it backwards.

00:11:35.428 --> 00:11:38.718
The power out equals the
force of the prop on the air,

00:11:38.718 --> 00:11:42.648
times the speed of the car,
minus the speed of the wind.

00:11:42.648 --> 00:11:44.778
The prop is going slower through the air

00:11:44.778 --> 00:11:46.348
due to the tailwind.

00:11:46.348 --> 00:11:47.968
And if we assume no losses,

00:11:47.968 --> 00:11:49.658
then the power in at the wheels,

00:11:49.658 --> 00:11:51.998
equals the power out at the propeller.

00:11:51.998 --> 00:11:52.988
From this equation,

00:11:52.988 --> 00:11:54.725
we can see that the force at the propeller

00:11:54.725 --> 00:11:58.238
will be greater than
the force at the wheels.

00:11:58.238 --> 00:12:00.365
And since the propeller
is pushing air back,

00:12:00.365 --> 00:12:03.468
the air applies an
equal and opposite force

00:12:03.468 --> 00:12:05.378
forward on the prop.

00:12:05.378 --> 00:12:07.948
This is the thrust force,
which will be greater

00:12:07.948 --> 00:12:10.051
than the backwards force on the wheels.

00:12:12.038 --> 00:12:15.624
So, this car works like
a lever or a pulley

00:12:15.624 --> 00:12:17.978
by applying a small force to the wheels

00:12:17.978 --> 00:12:19.798
over a larger distance,

00:12:19.798 --> 00:12:22.032
the propeller can apply a larger force

00:12:22.032 --> 00:12:24.117
over a smaller distance.

00:12:24.117 --> 00:12:27.058
This is just like when you're
riding a bike going up hill,

00:12:27.058 --> 00:12:30.148
you move the pedals fast,
but with smaller force,

00:12:30.148 --> 00:12:32.409
to make the wheels move
slower over the ground,

00:12:32.409 --> 00:12:34.161
but with a bigger force.

00:12:35.158 --> 00:12:37.648
But now we've run into the
divide by zero problem,

00:12:37.648 --> 00:12:40.058
that Professor Kusenko warned us about.

00:12:40.058 --> 00:12:41.068
When the speed of the car

00:12:41.068 --> 00:12:43.158
is exactly equal to the speed of the wind,

00:12:43.158 --> 00:12:46.848
it seems like the propeller
can provide infinite force.

00:12:46.848 --> 00:12:48.268
That can't be right, can it?

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:50.639
I mean, is our analysis flawed?

00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:53.928
The answer is no, for two reasons.

00:12:53.928 --> 00:12:56.218
First of all, this is
exactly what you'd expect

00:12:56.218 --> 00:12:58.748
theoretically, with any lever or pulley.

00:12:58.748 --> 00:13:00.618
If one arm of the lever is zero,

00:13:00.618 --> 00:13:03.098
then you can lift an infinite weight

00:13:03.098 --> 00:13:05.388
with any amount of
force on the other side.

00:13:05.388 --> 00:13:08.898
The catch is, it's
displacement will be zero.

00:13:08.898 --> 00:13:10.818
But second of all, in practice,

00:13:10.818 --> 00:13:12.528
there is a propeller efficiency term

00:13:12.528 --> 00:13:13.458
that is ill-defined

00:13:13.458 --> 00:13:15.798
when the propeller is not
moving through the air.

00:13:15.798 --> 00:13:18.328
- There's a better formula
for the prop proficiency,

00:13:18.328 --> 00:13:21.678
which is well-defined
in the zero speed limit.

00:13:21.678 --> 00:13:23.608
It makes an algebraic mess,

00:13:23.608 --> 00:13:25.148
but it's perfectly well-defined.

00:13:25.148 --> 00:13:28.668
- And then the divide by
zero problem is eliminated.

00:13:28.668 --> 00:13:30.378
But that equation makes the problem

00:13:30.378 --> 00:13:32.798
look more complicated than it actually is.

00:13:32.798 --> 00:13:35.108
You don't actually need aerodynamics.

00:13:35.108 --> 00:13:37.638
Here, I have a little
cart with a big wheel

00:13:37.638 --> 00:13:40.186
that rolls on two smaller spools.

00:13:40.186 --> 00:13:41.977
And what I'm gonna show

00:13:41.977 --> 00:13:44.728
is that when you have two media

00:13:44.728 --> 00:13:46.598
moving relative to one another,

00:13:46.598 --> 00:13:49.998
well then if this car is
in contact with both media,

00:13:49.998 --> 00:13:54.998
it can actually move faster
than their relative velocity.

00:13:55.068 --> 00:13:59.059
So as I push the board to the right,

00:13:59.059 --> 00:14:02.409
you can see that the
car goes down the board

00:14:02.409 --> 00:14:04.601
faster than the board is moving.

00:14:06.038 --> 00:14:07.178
If you look carefully,

00:14:07.178 --> 00:14:08.695
you'll see that the big wheel

00:14:08.695 --> 00:14:13.058
isn't turning the way that
the board is pushing it.

00:14:13.058 --> 00:14:16.098
It's actually rotating in
the opposite direction.

00:14:16.098 --> 00:14:18.596
That's just like the
propeller on Blackbird,

00:14:18.596 --> 00:14:21.868
which pushes back against the air,

00:14:21.868 --> 00:14:24.158
and that's how it's able to go faster

00:14:24.158 --> 00:14:26.438
than the wind downwind.

00:14:26.438 --> 00:14:29.521
Now you can build one of these
cars for yourself at home,

00:14:29.521 --> 00:14:34.018
or you can build a model downwind cart.

00:14:34.018 --> 00:14:35.738
I told you, Xyla was determined.

00:14:35.738 --> 00:14:37.838
Yeah, I'm gonna make the claim on camera.

00:14:37.838 --> 00:14:40.488
I like, I think it's gonna work this time.

00:14:40.488 --> 00:14:41.321
We're changing the propeller.

00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:42.208
- It has to work

00:14:42.208 --> 00:14:44.531
before we get kicked out of
the treadmill store. (laughing)

00:14:44.531 --> 00:14:47.281
(motors roaring)

00:14:53.062 --> 00:14:55.392
(chuckling)

00:14:55.392 --> 00:14:56.225
- [Derek] Does it work?

00:14:56.225 --> 00:14:57.488
- It totally works.

00:14:57.488 --> 00:14:58.838
- [Derek] Amazing.

00:14:58.838 --> 00:15:01.253
- Oh my god, it's so good.

00:15:01.253 --> 00:15:04.418
- Her fourth version of the
cart works spectacularly

00:15:04.418 --> 00:15:07.108
and it was designed to
be replicated by anyone

00:15:07.108 --> 00:15:10.498
using just a 3D printer and
a simple list of materials.

00:15:10.498 --> 00:15:12.498
She explains how to
build it with more detail

00:15:12.498 --> 00:15:13.578
on the engineering process

00:15:13.578 --> 00:15:15.098
on a video over on her channel.

00:15:15.098 --> 00:15:16.968
So go check it out.

00:15:16.968 --> 00:15:20.148
Now, professor Kusenko
has now conceded the bet,

00:15:20.148 --> 00:15:22.738
and he transferred $10,000 to me.

00:15:22.738 --> 00:15:24.798
So I wanna thank him for
being a man of honor,

00:15:24.798 --> 00:15:28.068
and changing his mind in light
of the evidence I presented,

00:15:28.068 --> 00:15:29.728
which is really not easy to do,

00:15:29.728 --> 00:15:32.228
especially in a public
debate like this one.

00:15:32.228 --> 00:15:34.339
Now I do not wanna keep the money.

00:15:34.339 --> 00:15:37.198
I wanna invest it in
science communication.

00:15:37.198 --> 00:15:40.868
So I'm holding a one-minute
video competition.

00:15:40.868 --> 00:15:44.498
I'll be awarding cash prizes
to the top three videos

00:15:44.498 --> 00:15:47.438
that explain a
counterintuitive STEM concept.

00:15:47.438 --> 00:15:50.472
I'll put some details
down in the description.

00:15:50.472 --> 00:15:52.398
What I love about science,

00:15:52.398 --> 00:15:55.438
is that disagreements are not problems.

00:15:55.438 --> 00:15:58.898
They are opportunities for
everyone to learn something.

00:15:58.898 --> 00:16:02.018
I learned a lot more about
Blackbird aerodynamics,

00:16:02.018 --> 00:16:04.668
and gear ratios than I knew before.

00:16:04.668 --> 00:16:05.501
I also learned

00:16:05.501 --> 00:16:07.288
that I should go into
more depth in my videos.

00:16:07.288 --> 00:16:09.818
I should make the evidence
overwhelmingly convincing

00:16:09.818 --> 00:16:11.548
and put in some equations toward the end

00:16:11.548 --> 00:16:13.722
for those who want that level of detail.

00:16:13.722 --> 00:16:16.738
I wanna thank everyone involved
in the making this video.

00:16:16.738 --> 00:16:19.738
Neil deGrasse Tyson, Bill
Nye, Sean Carroll, Mark Drela,

00:16:19.738 --> 00:16:22.188
Professor Kusenko and Xyla Foxlin,

00:16:22.188 --> 00:16:24.498
but especially Rick Cavallaro,

00:16:24.498 --> 00:16:26.503
the inventor and creator of Blackbird.

00:16:26.503 --> 00:16:28.609
He was a fountain of information,

00:16:28.609 --> 00:16:30.318
a constant source of support,

00:16:30.318 --> 00:16:32.898
and the man leading the charge
to help people understand

00:16:32.898 --> 00:16:35.798
this area of physics
for the past 15 years.

00:16:35.798 --> 00:16:38.372
Let's hope this video
puts the issue to rest

00:16:38.372 --> 00:16:40.574
once and for all.

00:16:40.574 --> 00:16:43.896
(electronics buzzing)

00:16:43.896 --> 00:16:46.908
The Blackbird craft all
started with a brain teaser.

00:16:46.908 --> 00:16:48.441
And this video sponsor, Brilliant,

00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:51.458
offers you a daily problem
to solve every day,

00:16:51.458 --> 00:16:53.448
like this one about gear ratios.

00:16:53.448 --> 00:16:55.608
If the first gear spins
10 times per second,

00:16:55.608 --> 00:16:57.978
at what rate does the final gear spin?

00:16:57.978 --> 00:16:59.248
Now I did this problem the hard way,

00:16:59.248 --> 00:17:01.758
but my wife figured out
how to do it the easy way.

00:17:01.758 --> 00:17:03.888
And that's what brain
teasers are great for.

00:17:03.888 --> 00:17:05.328
They get you thinking about the world,

00:17:05.328 --> 00:17:07.078
and they give you insights into problems

00:17:07.078 --> 00:17:09.538
you might think you already understand.

00:17:09.538 --> 00:17:10.371
Just think about

00:17:10.371 --> 00:17:12.603
how much more you would
understand in a year,

00:17:12.603 --> 00:17:14.078
if you got into the habit

00:17:14.078 --> 00:17:17.488
of solving one novel
unexpected problem per day.

00:17:17.488 --> 00:17:18.478
And while you're at it,

00:17:18.478 --> 00:17:20.188
why not take one of Brilliant's courses,

00:17:20.188 --> 00:17:22.308
like on computer science, neural networks,

00:17:22.308 --> 00:17:23.454
or classical physics.

00:17:23.454 --> 00:17:25.378
Even physics professors can benefit

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:27.636
from some of the lessons
on frames of reference.

00:17:27.636 --> 00:17:30.008
Somehow I managed to go my whole degree

00:17:30.008 --> 00:17:31.798
without learning Lagrangian mechanics.

00:17:31.798 --> 00:17:34.728
So that's a course I'm
working through at the moment.

00:17:34.728 --> 00:17:37.018
It's a really elegant way
of solving physics problems.

00:17:37.018 --> 00:17:39.668
And I wish I had learned about it sooner.

00:17:39.668 --> 00:17:40.501
