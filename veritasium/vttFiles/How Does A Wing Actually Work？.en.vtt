00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.450
Shh...

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:07.059
I've snuck into minutephysics' studio to explain
how a wing actually works

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:10.200
Hang on, something doesn't feel right.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.120
Ah, that's better.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.590
Now everyone knows that a wing generates lift
due to its characteristic shape

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.040
Since air travels farther over top of the
wing, it must go faster than the air underneath

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.000
so that both streams meet up simultaneously
at the trailing edge

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.230
And according to Bernoulli's principle, faster
flowing air exerts less pressure than the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.890
slower air beneath the wing
This pressure difference creates an upward

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.620
force -- lift.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.710
Job done.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.710
Right?

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.620
Nope
This simple explanation taught in many textbooks

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.430
and classrooms has obvious problems
Like how could a plane fly upside down?

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.810
Some planes like the Wright brothers' had
nearly flat wings.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.130
So presumably air would travel the same speed
over both sides and there would be no lift

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.290
Plus experiments show that air streams don't
meet up at the back of the wing.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.250
Air over the top goes significantly faster,
reaching the trailing edge first.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.559
So how does a wing actually generate lift?

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.710
Well the key is the wing must deflect air
downwards

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.210
This can be achieved using asymmetric or cambered
air foils

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.819
Or by increasing the angle of attack
Air under the wing is deflected down

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:19.399
And by the coanda effect
air above the wing is guided along its surface

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.090
and down as well
Since the air is slowed and deflected down

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.459
by the wing,
it pushes the wing up and back.

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:28.469
Lift, and drag.

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:30.939
This is in accordance with Newton's Third
Law of Motion

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:36.310
But hang on, if you can explain lift only
using the deflection of air and Newton's laws,

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.509
then the Bernoulli explanation must be completely
wrong

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.859
Well, no,
air over the top of the wing does go faster

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:45.590
than air beneath, creating a pressure difference
that generates lift

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.229
Then this Newtonian explanation is unnecessary
rubbish and the original explanation was right!

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.329
That's not true either.

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.380
The original explanation incorrectly assumed
that air over and under the wing must reconnect

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.040
at the trailing edge, and there was no mention
of deflecting air down.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.999
Each explanation, done correctly, completely
accounts for the lift generated by a wing.

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:08.840
They're just two different ways of looking
at the same thing.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.349
So next time someone brings up the standard
misconception, you can tell them that explanation

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.760
just doesn't fly.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.250
And if you liked that, you've gotta check
out MinutePhysics.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.739
I've got total respect for a guy who does
this every week.

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:38.049
Sincerely, a collection of particles known
as Derek.
