00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.010
- On December 1st, 2022,

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.440
the journal "Nature"
published a cover story

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.900
about a holographic wormhole.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.600
It was purportedly created
inside a quantum computer

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.440
to probe the intersection of
quantum mechanics and gravity.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.940
The story kicked off a frenzy
of tweets and news headlines.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.920
- Nobody has seen the wormhole.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.630
Nobody has produced one.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.010
- Well, we'll
take the world's best

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.440
quantum computer and
see if we can map that

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.700
into building the wormhole.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.160
- The wormhole becomes
traversable, it opens.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.663
You really can go through.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.215
- Bull (beep).
(host laughing)

00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:36.048
(magnets clicking)

00:00:36.048 --> 00:00:37.780
- This video is sponsored by Shopify.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.100
The problem was, of course,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.470
that no wormhole had been created.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.580
- It feeds on itself, right?

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.380
When one story starts,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.720
then other media outlets grab hold of it

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.580
and so it spreads very, very quickly.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.800
- What actually happened is that a super,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.930
a quantum computer is built

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.730
and within this quantum computer,

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.530
you can do some calculations.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.520
Calculations that can
be done with my iPhone

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.300
because all the most powerful
quantum computers today,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.650
at most do calculations

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.870
that can easily be done on my iPhone.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.460
- You basically have something

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.670
that represents the
mathematics of a wormhole.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.470
But the way the story was sold, of course,

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.680
is that in doing this,
whatever calculation they did,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.260
they had created the wormhole.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.397
- They say so in the same
sense in which I could say,

00:01:24.397 --> 00:01:27.877
"Look, my children has built a rocket

00:01:27.877 --> 00:01:29.670
"that goes to the moon."

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.223
Say, "Wow, what kind of child you have?

00:01:33.247 --> 00:01:34.497
"Yeah, here it is."

00:01:34.497 --> 00:01:38.460
And I show you a little
sketch on a piece of paper

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.827
when there is a drawing of
a rocket going to the moon

00:01:40.827 --> 00:01:41.940
and say, "Look!"

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.970
So what the quantum computer
has done is exactly that.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.920
There's a little sketch of what
could be perhaps a warm hole

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.040
in some hypothetical theory,
which is probably wrong.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.000
Is this interesting?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.230
Yes, it is interesting

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.150
because the fact that
with quantum computers

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.820
you can do these things
mean that quantum computers,

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.740
a little bit, sort of begin working.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.650
So people get excited about
that and then they go out

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.707
and tell to the world, "Oh,
we've created a wormhole

00:02:08.707 --> 00:02:09.987
"in a quantum computer,"

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.200
over overemphasizing the wormhole,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.010
which probably don't exist,
the theory being used of that,

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.480
which probably is wrong,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.310
and the utility of quantum computers,

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.870
which is not yet there.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.180
So that's an example of bad communication,

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.350
very bad communication.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.340
I was embarrassed,

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.680
I was angry with my
colleagues who did that.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.420
- To me, it looks like the source

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.820
of this problem is bad incentives.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.370
Scientists need to secure
funding for their research

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.410
and increasingly that depends on

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.630
attracting public attention to their work.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.643
- It's just become part
of the culture of science,

00:02:41.643 --> 00:02:44.310
that it's expected that you will have some

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.080
sort of media attention

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.470
and to get that attention,
you have to sell your science

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.560
and often it's not the
result of the science

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.290
that is the story, it's something else.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.690
- Universities seek to promote themselves

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.990
to attract students and
bolster their reputations.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.420
- And nowhere in the scientific method is,

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.450
and you release a press release,

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.390
but it's just become part of the norm now.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.830
- Press releases simplify and
may overstate the research

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.510
and journalists just want to get

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.510
as many clicks on their
stories as they can.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.090
The end result of this incentivized game

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.640
of telephone can be oversimplified

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.530
sensationalized headlines,
science that is just plain wrong.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.210
Now, I myself have been guilty

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.070
of over-hyping a science story.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.760
Back in 2014, I made a video
about the bicep two experiment.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.340
So this is one of the hugest discoveries

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.020
in science of all time.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.690
Researchers reportedly
detected polarization

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.270
in the cosmic microwave
background radiation.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.360
Allegedly it was caused by
gravitational fluctuations

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.660
just a fraction of a
second after the big bang.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.300
The result was considered
the first real evidence

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.710
of the quantum nature of gravity

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.280
and a smoking gun for inflation theory.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.830
Experimenters even surprised Andre Lind,

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.100
one of the founders of
inflation theory with the news.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.830
- Let's just hope that it is not a trick.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.683
I always leave with this feeling,

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.320
what if I'm tricked?

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.320
What if I believe in this
just because it is beautiful?

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.410
- Unfortunately, further
observations showed

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.960
that it was likely just
dust in our own galaxy

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.000
rather than primordial gravitational waves

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.760
that created the polarization in the CMB.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.830
So I took down my video

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.800
and to this day I am
wary about making videos

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.020
about breaking science news.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.230
Like any type of breaking news,
there is a high probability

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.780
that early reports will
turn out to be wrong.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.910
Just a few months ago,
a paper was uploaded

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.710
to the Archive Pre-print Server

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.440
claiming to have discovered
the first room temperature

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.750
ambient pressure superconductor.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.230
This again triggered a
flood of media attention.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.660
- [Reporter] A monumental breakthrough,

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.293
room temperature superconductor LK99.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.870
- One of the most important scientific

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.090
breakthroughs of the 21st century.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.840
- If the discovery were real,
it would've been a big deal.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.610
- The room temperature
superconductor stuff,

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.300
of course, is such a
dream 'cause if it worked,

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.390
it would revolutionize everything, right?

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.760
Transmission of energy,
that kind of stuff.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.340
The world would be different if it worked.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.710
- But even before attempts
to replicate the material

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.180
and its properties failed,

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.030
there were clear signs
that the claim was false.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.400
In the only published
plot showing resistivity

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.880
versus temperature, the
resistivity did not drop to zero

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.210
as you'd expect at the
supposed critical temperature.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.420
Instead, it continued to
decrease below this value.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.640
Plus the resistivity
scale was given in units

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.670
of 10 to the minus two ohm centimeters.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.890
On that scale, any ordinary conductor

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.200
would appear to have zero resistivity.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.940
Copper's resistivity, for example,

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.360
is on the order of 10 to the
minus six ohm centimeters.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.090
A video showed the material
apparently levitating

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.210
above a permanent magnet
in a supposed demonstration

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.830
of the Meisner effect.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.020
But in that same video, the material

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.820
also sticks to the magnet,

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.850
something a superconductor would not do.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.250
And finally there is this plot,

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.200
showing that over the
past a hundred years,

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.150
scientists have found new materials

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.910
with progressively higher
critical temperatures.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.210
But as of now, all the
highest temperature materials

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.790
only super conduct at very high pressures.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.850
For an ambient pressure room
temperature superconductor,

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.040
we would need a jump
in critical temperature

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.370
of around 125 degrees Celsius.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.920
That's a lot and this brings up the point

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.070
that it is the most unexpected
and surprising results

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.930
that get the most attention,

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.970
but it is also these very same results

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.610
that are the most likely to be false.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.980
In social science, it's
been shown that studies

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.990
that later fail to be replicated,

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.560
receive on average 153 more citations

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.810
than studies that can be replicated.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.570
Similar buzz surrounds faulty research

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.170
in the physical sciences.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.060
- The Italians, I'm Italian,

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.240
came out announcing into
the world some time ago

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.010
that the neutrino was faster than light

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.430
and then measured it and
it turned out to be a plug

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.500
that was not fitting well

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.230
and so the entire machine
was not working well.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.030
- When the truth is discovered,

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.660
it rarely gets as much attention
as the original finding.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.317
- The fallout where everybody was going,

00:07:23.317 --> 00:07:25.957
"Oh, well this doesn't work
and this doesn't look right

00:07:25.957 --> 00:07:27.757
"and there's no way this material can do

00:07:27.757 --> 00:07:29.070
"what they say it's doing."

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.380
That sort of fizzles in the background,

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.630
it doesn't get the same media attention.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.107
- There is the apt saying,

00:07:35.107 --> 00:07:36.817
"A lie can travel around the world

00:07:36.817 --> 00:07:39.780
"while the truth is still
putting on its shoes."

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.730
But that saying might need to be updated

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:44.430
in the age of social
media when lies now have

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.620
an even greater advantage.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:50.220
Do you think it's a bigger
problem now than it used to be?

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.590
- I must admit that I
think it's getting worse.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:53.760
I think there's a feeling

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.150
that you've got to change the world

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.250
to be noticed by the media.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.560
- Over-hyping science
discoveries can give people

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.143
a false sense of how science works.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.130
If that latest discovery I hear
about turns out to be false,

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.050
what else could be untrue?

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.930
- People keep telling me
that cosmology's in crisis

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.210
and all this kind of stuff
because that's the kind of stories

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:16.680
they hear in the media.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.617
Eventually people will say,

00:08:17.617 --> 00:08:20.137
"Well, why are we funding these things

00:08:20.137 --> 00:08:22.170
"if it's always just turmoil?"

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.420
- Making bold unsubstantiated claims

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.120
also reduces trust in scientists.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.360
- So we are enlarging a little bit.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.980
The conversation here is not
just single pieces of news.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.773
I think there are entire
fields which are hyped.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:42.390
- Wait, entire fields of science that are-

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:43.590
- Yes.
- Hyped.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:44.423
- Yes.

00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:45.870
- But aren't really legit

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:50.040
or just they're all hot air or...

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.300
- Oh no, no, they're not hot air.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.610
- [Host] Fusion, fusion's big in the news.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:54.870
People think it's close, right?

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:55.703
There's startups,

00:08:55.703 --> 00:08:57.390
there's people getting
billions of dollars.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.610
- Exactly, I don't know
where we are there.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.170
Again, it's not my field,

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.058
but there was one particular announcement,

00:09:04.058 --> 00:09:04.891
what is it?

00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:05.724
One year ago or something.

00:09:05.724 --> 00:09:07.290
- [Host] I remember this announcement.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.770
- Scientists have produced
a nuclear fusion reaction

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.710
that created more energy
than was expended,

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.740
a breakthrough to tap into
the same kind of energy

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.110
that powers the sun and the stars.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.350
- Simply put, this is one of the most

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:26.666
impressive scientific
feats of the 21st century.

00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:28.116
(audience applauding)
Right?

00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:36.300
(audience applauding)

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.070
- Which is bull (beep) again

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:43.070
because it was in the
context of military research,

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:48.950
nuclear energy, basically for
weapons in a way of doing it,

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:55.260
which at the present, has no visible way

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.220
of how to become industrial
way of producing energy.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.990
- [Host] Yeah, there's no way to scale.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.370
- There's no way to scale it up.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.800
- [Host] This is just lasers at appellate.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.820
- Just little thing and
you compress it enormously

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.640
and then it's basically it explodes

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.460
because it's a mini,
mini nuclear explosion

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.070
and then you have more energy

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:21.390
than the actual pressure energy

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.220
that was needed to compress it.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.507
That's correct, but you
need huge amount of,

00:10:25.507 --> 00:10:27.180
excessive energy for doing that.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:31.140
That was sold as a big step
toward the solving the energetic

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.110
problem of the world, but it's not.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:36.483
- Back in '87, fusion,

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.060
already people were talking about it

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.040
like it's around the corner.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.090
We just need 20 years more
work and we'll crack it.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.130
And we have exactly the same story today

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:50.070
with the current experiments.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.050
- Something that is not overhyped

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.450
is this video sponsor, Shopify.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.250
And I would know, because I've been

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.460
personally using Shopify for eight years.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.230
You know something a lot of
people don't know about me

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.240
is that before I was a YouTuber,

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.880
I worked as a science
teacher at a tutoring company

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.080
in Sydney.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.200
But I was always frustrated
by this misconception

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.220
students had that bonds
store energy, they don't.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.260
So I decided to make a better version

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.500
of the traditional ball and
stick model of molecules.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.950
One where the atoms snapped
together magnetically.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.590
I came across these little ball magnets

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.570
and in my first prototype I pushed them

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.540
inside little styrofoam
balls and I learned

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.450
about plastics and injection
molding, ultrasonic welding,

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:36.345
and I brought my
invention Snatoms to life.

00:11:36.345 --> 00:11:38.790
(magnets clicking)

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.410
But one thing I had no clue about

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:42.570
was how to run an online store

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:44.580
and that's where Shopify came in.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.840
They had simple templates.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.410
So I set up the Snatoms
store in just one day.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.810
Shopify allowed me to process payments,

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.520
withhold appropriate state taxes

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.200
and see everything that was happening

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.910
with my store at a glance.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:57.990
Plus, it also integrates

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.060
with lots of third party apps and sites.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.060
So, for example, I could offer
multiple different methods

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.020
of shipping and this
makes fulfillment a snap.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:06.853
(magnet clicking)

00:12:06.853 --> 00:12:08.700
I also got set up for Google shopping

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.290
right from within the app

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:13.320
and it was simple to create
automated reminder emails

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.810
like if someone forgets
something in their cart.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:19.170
The whole store runs with
very little attention from me,

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.980
which is great because I'm
always working on the next video.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.160
So I think there is a reason
that everyone is using Shopify

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.800
for their online store
or their side hustle,

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.380
because it offers
everything you could want,

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.080
it's easy to use and it's very affordable.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.880
I highly recommend Shopify to anyone

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.470
who's thinking about starting a business

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.570
and for a free trial of Shopify,

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:42.390
go to shopify.com/veritasium.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.720
And now back to science hype.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.210
Science is interesting in
that you can divide it up

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.490
into basically two categories.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:53.100
One is an established body of knowledge

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.850
and the other is speculations,
things that might be true,

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:59.370
but we don't really have any
solid evidence for them yet.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.790
And because there can be
an infinity of bad ideas

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:03.990
and only one truth,

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:07.260
most of these speculations
are likely wrong.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.540
But the way certain topics
are discussed in the media,

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.100
it may be impossible to tell

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.500
if they're part of the
established body of knowledge

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.110
or just very fanciful speculation.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.737
- There are too many
books out there saying,

00:13:17.737 --> 00:13:18.877
"We have understood that the world's

00:13:18.877 --> 00:13:21.120
"made by strings and string theory."

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.100
It's not true, not at all.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.780
We have not understood that the world

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.160
is described as string theory.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.530
We have a very interesting
tentative theory,

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.840
which is string theory,
which has that some success

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.320
and some failures and that's interesting.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.430
If you want to tell about this research,

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.050
do tell about this research,

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.010
but don't tell people that

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.440
it's what we have learned about the world.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.123
- One question I have is,

00:13:50.988 --> 00:13:53.100
how do we get past the
over-hyping of science?

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.410
Because it seems like the system is set up

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.540
to reward over-hyping.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.670
It rewards the journalists
'cause they get the clicks.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:00.840
It rewards the scientists,

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.150
they may get the money or the attention.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.250
So I don't know, I'm kind of curious

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.160
whether a solution is possible.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.263
- Yeah, I think there is one,

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.420
and it's exactly what you're doing.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.510
By talking about the fact

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:21.090
that there is a risk of overhyping.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:22.327
If I can go out and say,

00:14:22.327 --> 00:14:25.980
"Oh, my quantum computer
produced a wormhole,"

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:30.000
and nobody says anything,
that's a problem.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.400
If we talk about the risk of over-hyping,

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.510
if we talk about the
risk of presenting ideas,

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.610
theories, radical results,

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:42.720
which are very, very tentative, as solid,

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:47.720
then we sort of immunize
ourself against this danger.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.380
- Science is not presented on the news

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.680
like sport is presented on the news.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.120
At the end of the news, you
get 10 minutes of sports

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.470
where they will talk about the fact

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.600
that somebody kicked a
ball around in a field

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.460
and it's not that particularly important.

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.870
So you get the full rundown

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.810
of lots of bits and
pieces of what's going on.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.880
But to get a science story,

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.887
it has to be Earth
shattering kind of thing.

00:15:07.887 --> 00:15:10.320
It has to be a big story.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:14.790
What many scientists would
like is this larger picture

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:18.810
of the fact that the entire
enterprise is moving forward.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.850
That there are lots of things happening

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:24.360
and we definitely know more
tomorrow than we do today,

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.750
but that's not the way that it
gets picked up by the media.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.450
- Well, ultimately, almost
everyone is incentivized

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.970
to sensationalize scientific findings.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:34.650
So I think it's important to remember that

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:37.650
anytime you hear a
science story on the news,

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.690
surprising, unexpected results

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.270
that have not been
independently replicated,

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:45.300
they are more likely than not to be wrong.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.880
But despite this, I remain
convinced that science

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.370
is the best way to get at the truth.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:52.650
I mean, sure, in the short term,

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:54.030
some may seek the spotlight

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.830
by rushing the data analysis,

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:59.250
overstating results or
circumventing peer review.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:00.900
but in the long term,

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.200
that is not going to
win you the Nobel Prize.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.900
The bold claims, mistakes and dead ends,

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.300
they will fade into oblivion

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.150
and only sound science
that is vigorously tested

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.950
and independently validated,

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:17.673
that is what makes it into the
accepted body of knowledge.

00:16:21.394 --> 00:16:24.311
