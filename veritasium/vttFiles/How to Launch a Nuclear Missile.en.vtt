00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.820
During the Cold War the US and the Soviet Union
had to build underground silos to house

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.240
nuclear missiles that could be launched
at a few minutes notice.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.200
Now, one of the technical challenges they had
to overcome that you might not think of

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.760
is acoustics.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.400
Launching a missile in such a confined silo generates

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.360
a loud sound, so loud that it would've
shaken apart the missiles

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.320
before they could even launch.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.800
So the walls of the inside of the silo had to be covered

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.960
in acoustically absorbent tiles,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.480
very similar to those in the world's quietest room.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.260
But after all of the technical challenges were sorted,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.220
what I wanted to know was
'how could they have launched these missiles

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.600
very quickly, if needed, but also never by accident?'

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.680
So I visited one of these Titan missile silos
in the Arizona desert

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.140
to find out exactly what it would have taken
to launch a nuclear missile.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.600
Well, Derek this is level 2 of the silo, we are
down some 10 meters below the surface now.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.300
And this...

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.360
is the launch duct.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.720
— Wow.
— And that is Titan II.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.320
The largest and most powerful missile weapons system
ever deployed by the United States.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.980
And what kind of bomb is in there?

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.020
That is a thermonuclear bomb.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.840
It is a 9 megaton weapon.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.640
Compared to Hiroshima?

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.960
Oh, call it 650 times.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.780
An enormously powerful weapon.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.020
And what was the idea with it?

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.040
The idea behind Titan II was to instill
enough fear in the mind of the enemy,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.400
to cause them to think twice about launching an attack against us.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.780
Knowing that 10 meters below the desert in our fortified concrete bunker,

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.100
we could ride out their first strike, and live to retaliate,
if we're forced to do that,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.380
the consequences for the enemy
would be so unspeakably horrible

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.600
that maybe they would prefer not to
get into it with us in the first place.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.280
That's the essence of deterrence.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.780
This missile is no longer active,
but the launch system is preserved.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.600
And I wanted an insight into how it felt
to control this incredible power.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.520
Can we go launch one?

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.240
I thought you'd never ask!

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.800
There were 54 of these silos, each one
staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.380
Ready to launch their missiles on the exclusive order of
the President of the United States.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.200
Alright then, have a seat here Commander.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.220
Thank you.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.220
So, this is the control center, this is where
the crew waited to launch the missile.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.560
And how do we know when we need to launch?

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.060
[Speaker beeping]

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.340
On radio: 'Alpha, 2, 3, Charlie, Hotel, Victor'
(A23CHV)

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.520
So, we're going to write down every letter and number
that we hear in a form in this notebook.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.820
I'm going to write it down in this notebook.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.660
We'll compare each other's work.
If we agree that we've copied the message correctly,

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.480
then we have what's called a 'valid message,'

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.380
and authorization to take our lock off the big red safe.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.080
You know your combination, I know mine,
we don't know each other,

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.320
so we both have to agree to get inside.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.920
Inside we find authenticator cards.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.420
I'll give those to you.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.640
In the secret message, they sent us
a seven-character code word.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.560
We're going to look at the first two letters of
the code word, we're going to find the authenticator

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.860
that has those first two letters.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.620
If the card here matches the code word they sent us,
then this is a legitimate order to go.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.920
That gives us permission to put in our launch keys.
I've already put them in for us.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.980
Key right here for you, commander.
And for me there's a key right over here.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.920
The keys are far enough apart that not even
a long-armed guy like me can reach them both.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.640
The keys must be turned within 2 seconds of each other

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.720
and held, they're spring loaded,

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.340
so held for 5 seconds to start the launch.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.200
That guarantees that two people
will be required to do it.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.220
You just can't run back and forth and do it yourself.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.100
And last but not least, we need
the secret unlock code for the missle.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.000
Six little wheels. Each little wheel
has 16 letters of the alphabet.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.100
Nominally 17 million combinations.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.580
Only one will operate the missile.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.380
This is the fail safe that prevents an unauthorized
or accidental launch of the missle.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.720
So once we have all those things:
authentication, keys, code, we're good to go.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.100
— All set?
— Let's do it.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.480
Give me a countdown, "3-2-1 Turn keys",
we'll send this thing on it's way.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.420
After you comander.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.200
3...

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.020
2...

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.760
1...

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.160
Turn keys.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.040
And hold.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.440
Okay, you may release.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.120
That's all there is to it.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.200
The green light turns on. Its says "Launch enable".

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.200
For all intents and purposes,
that should say "Welcome to World War III"

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.880
Because that's pretty much what it boils down to.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.620
When you turn the key you are committed.
There is no "Oops" switch anywhere.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.120
When the batteries come to full power,
the missile will transfer to internal power,

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.340
meaning that it is fully independent.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.800
About that same time, the silo door starts to slide open.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.200
It will slide through security radar beams
and set off the alarm.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.400
That gives us "Silo Soft".

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.100
"Guidance Go" means the internal guidance computer
has full control of the mission.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.800
In a few seconds we'll have main engine start.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.260
From engine start we will build up thrust.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.660
Pump the hold down bolts.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.300
And off you go.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.020
Into the wild we know.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.040
So that's it? We just basically just ended life on Earth.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.840
As you know it.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.240
In these silos, the Titan missiles
had a terrifying purpose.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.280
But they were also put to much better uses,
minus their war-head of course.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.600
For example, the Voyager spacecraft was launched
into space atop a Titan III missile.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.840
And Neil Armstrong took his first
flight into space atop a Titan II.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.620
The exact same missile that would have delivered
nuclear warheads to the Soviet Union.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:33.940
So the Cold War didn't only bring us this fear
and potential of mutually assured destruction,

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.880
it also made space exploration possible.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:44.280
Now I want to say thank you to everyone for writing in
to request that this documentary be played in your area.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.280
Thanks to you, we've managed to get it broadcast
in Norway, Sweden and the Middle East.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.640
And details are in the description, so check it out.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:57.800
For everyone else, the documentray will be
available online via our broadcasters

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.000
though there may be some geo-blocking restrictions.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:06.720
But I'm pretty confident that anyone who wants to see
the documentary will be able to via those means.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.700
So I hope you watch it, I hope you enjoy it.
It premiers in just a few days in the US.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.060
That's July 28th:
10pm Eastern, 9 Central.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.560
For more details check out links in the description.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.940
I hope you check it out and I really hope you enjoy it. I appreciate so much your support.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.740
It means everything to me.
So again, thanks for watching.
