[WARNING! SPIDERS IN THE VIDEO ]

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.580
Why are the most venomous species found in the warmest places on Earth? I mean, take Australia for example.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.580
Depending on who you ask, it has all or nearly all of the ten most venomous snakes in the world,

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.299
plus the funnel-Web spider, the blue ringed octopus, box jellyfish,

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:25.109
paralysis tick and stonefish, all found in Australia, are the most lethal of their kind and even this cute

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.029
platypus has an ankle spur,

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.029
which in the male, secretes a venom that can kill a dog. In humans it would merely cause excruciating

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:41.009
pain. This question, why do the most venomous species live in the warmest places, is one that I've wondered about for most of my life.

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.989
Perhaps it's because I was born here in the small town of Traralgon, Australia.

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.479
This is the first house where I ever

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.360
lived. As my mum recalls {Derek's Mum}"in the backyard there was a shade where we found red backs,

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:00.329
and I used to play in the shed? {Derek's Mum}"I don't think once we found the red backs that we let you in there.".

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.549
Yeah, that's very comforting. Thanks mum.

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.329
Now if you don't know what a red back is, it's a very poisonous spider. Hold up.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.959
I gotta tell past Derek something. You see it's important that we say venomous and not poisonous because poisonous means

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.029
it'll be harmful if you eat it, whereas venomous means it'll try to eat you and that will be harmful.

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.860
Continue. So thankfully they never bit me, otherwise, I wouldn't be standing

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.360
 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.020
here today. Now before we go any further,

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.640
it's probably worth asking, is it true, do more venomous species really live in hot places?

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.192
Well apparently I'm not the only one who thinks so because I found this

00:01:34.192 --> 00:01:36.869
reddit thread on the topic. Though, it really didn't explain

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.839
why that was the case. But what about the data? Well, here is a map of the global average temperatures.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.290
Compare that with this map that I've colored in according to the number of venomous species in each country.

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:56.218
The country with the most venomous species is Mexico with eighty different organisms with the power to kill you.

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.339
That's followed closely by Brazil and then Australia.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.019
Well this seems to all match up very well with the global average temperatures.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:11.970
So why is it so? My first hypothesis was that there's something about the heat which enables the formation of these venom molecules.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.870
So I ran that idea past Professor Polyakov of Periodic Videos

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.049
{Professor Polyakov}"no intent filter" [alright] "because the reason is that if you go up a

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.180
ten degrees centigrade change in temperature round about room temperature

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.980
[okay], will only double the rate of most chemical reactions and

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.740
I don't think anything evolutionary is likely to

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.620
evolve to such a big difference based on just a factor of two in the rates."

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.640
So maybe it's worth asking what are these venom molecules exactly?

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.449
Well, in most species where the venom is delivered by fangs it is

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:52.920
evolved from saliva. In the

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.336
funnel-web spider for example, the lethal effect seems quite accidental.

00:02:57.336 --> 00:02:59.640
What you've got to understand about venom,

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.570
it's there, it's a secondary thing that it actually kills. The actual reason that spiders have got venom is

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.390
to digest their prey. That they happen to do most of it before they actually eat it.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.210
Injecting the venom and the venom

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.230
will start to liquefy whatever they've caught and,

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.990
once it's turned to liquid,

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.279
all spiders live on soup. The funnel-web evolved without any humans or other primates around and yet,

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.040
ironically, its venom is most potent for exactly this group. Biggest  evolutionary joke ever,

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.599
the only group of animals with backbones

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.979
that's actually allergic to their venom are the primates.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.800
We don't have primates in Australia.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.279
All right, so it's lemurs, monkeys, apes

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.250
and us.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.380
Thus most species deliver, not just one type of venom molecule

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.499
but a whole cocktail of different proteins that range in length from short chain to very long chain

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.160
molecules

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.726
and these molecules can serve a range of functions. Some are

00:04:06.726 --> 00:04:09.639
neurotoxins which can disable your nervous system.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.758
Others are hemotoxins which actually attack your blood cells and can

00:04:13.758 --> 00:04:16.929
dissolve tissues, but since we're talking about cocktails,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.440
what would happen if you drank some venom? You could

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.070
take a vial of taipan venom and happily have it with your scotch

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.799
and it wouldn't be a problem as long as you didn't have any

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.037
irritation on the mucosal lining or any stomach ulcer or things like this. It's

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:33.070
got to get into the bloodstream to be a problem.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.919
Okay, so since drinking the venom is not gonna kill you,

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.269
what should you do if you get bitten by say an inland taipan?

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.010
That's the world's most venomous land snake. What you do? Don't panic. Stay calm.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.239
I think that would be easier said than done. The venom travels through the lymphatic system,

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.630
so it doesn't usually travel through the veins or the blood vessels,

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.890
so that's just quite close on under the skin, and if it reaches your nervous system

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.100
it'll shut down the signaling pathways that keep your heart beating and your lungs breathing, and so what

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.560
actually kills you is suffocation.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.049
So what you need to do is stay very still and

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.669
bandage up the limb that's been bitten from the tip all the way back to your torso.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.140
Now the bandage needs to be really tight to trap the venom within the lymphatic system,

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.219
but not so tight as to cut off the blood flow to the limb.

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:27.549
Now once you've got it bandaged up, you need to find some anti-venom. What is anti-venom?

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:28.330
Well,

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.032
it's made by injecting a large organism like a horse with a dilute solution of

00:05:33.032 --> 00:05:35.710
the venom. The horse then produces antibodies

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.455
for that venom which you can harvest and inject into yourself in case you get

00:05:40.455 --> 00:05:43.570
bitten. Making anti-venom is tough work. It would take

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:50.799
seventy milkings of a funnel-web spider to get enough venom to make a single dose of anti-venom and what's worse

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.599
anti-venom can only be used on an individual a limited number of times because

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:02.619
over those uses your body will build up antibodies to the anti-venom making the anti-venom ineffective.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.240
So you might wonder well,

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.590
why can't you just inject yourself with dilute amounts of venom and build up

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.470
your own antibodies to the venom? That would work

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.019
except for the fact that when you get bitten you need to have a lot of antibodies in your system

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:23.680
and to keep your antibodies at that high level you would need to keep injecting yourself with the venom, say every month

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.380
and that's probably not the best thing for you.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:32.139
But why is it that people in warm climates need to worry about this and not people in cold climates?

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.490
Well, I went to the experts to find out about this trend. You know broadly,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:43.209
yeah, there's really not much of a pattern happening. Really? What about that reddit thread and the map

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.200
I made? If you're saying, is there a

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.579
global pattern showing that you get more venomous animals in hot places,

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.680
I don't know if there is. In snakes,

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.859
which is the group that I'm most familiar with, in Australia the pattern is the

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.431
diametric reverse of that one. If you wander around Southern Australia,

00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:00.099
every snake you find on that

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.310
Kosciusko is venomous. If you wander around the tropics of Darwin,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.380
you're very unlikely to see a venomous snake. They're all pythons and harmless colubrid snakes. Now

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.529
this is unexpected. The most venomous snakes in Australia

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.899
live in the coldest places and the reason for that is? 20 million years ago

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:23.050
an itinerant sea snake coming down from Asia as Australia drifted up to Asia, got to Australia.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.302
It was venomous to start with. There were no snakes in Australia at the

00:07:27.302 --> 00:07:28.870
time and so venomous snakes

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.220
radiated through Australia. This big family called the elapid II the Cobra family. Okay,

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.437
but on a global scale, my point remains. There are more venomous

00:07:36.437 --> 00:07:38.649
species in hot countries. There's gonna be

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:44.109
vastly more venomous snakes in a warm climate area than in a cold climate area. The problem

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.950
is that there's vastly more snakes.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.930
So as a proportion of the

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:52.239
snakes that are there, the venomous guys are probably going to be about the same and

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:56.589
maybe even less in the case of a place like Australia than they would be in a cold area.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.440
So why are there more venomous species in warm places?

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.371
Well the truth is there aren't, at least not as a proportion of species. The

00:08:04.371 --> 00:08:06.880
majority of venomous species on Earth are

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:11.979
ectotherms. Those are organisms whose body temperatures are regulated by their surroundings.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.654
Now that means that they can only really have short bursts of energy, so

00:08:16.654 --> 00:08:19.690
instead of chasing down prey and running away from predators,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.869
they needed a different strategy to allow them to survive and so many of them evolved venom.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:29.620
There is a greater diversity of ectotherms in warm climates,

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:33.460
so it only stands to reason that there will be a greater number of venomous species.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.029
But that's not to say that there aren't venomous species in cold places.

00:08:37.339 --> 00:08:41.979
The only snakes that get into the arctic circle are European vipers, a venomous species.

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:47.109
But biodiversity alone isn't the complete answer to this question. It also

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.230
depends on

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:52.175
evolutionary history. If you had come to Australia 20 million years ago, there

00:08:52.175 --> 00:08:55.210
would have been no snakes at all. The venomous ones got here

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:58.626
first and the non-venomous came after. I think it's a really lousy

00:08:58.626 --> 00:09:01.059
explanation, but it's the best one that we've got.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.960
Why is that a lousy explanation? Well it's

00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:07.339
doesn't

00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:09.699
invite any lovely complicated piece of

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:11.830
ecological theory or anything else.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.339
It's just relying on history.

00:09:13.339 --> 00:09:19.179
But this is a pattern that's very strong and doesn't seem to be explicable any other way and nowadays in Hawaii

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.430
there are no venomous snakes and the same goes for

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.955
Jamaica. These are warm places that just haven't evolved or have lost any

00:09:25.955 --> 00:09:28.180
venomous snakes that they may have had.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.243
So it might just be a lucky accident

00:09:30.243 --> 00:09:33.969
that we've been fortunate enough to be blessed with a few venomous spiders.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.429
I am also reminded that

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.430
we're living in a particular point in time,

00:09:38.839 --> 00:09:44.049
roughly 15,000 years after the last ice age. Now that would have wiped a lot of the

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:46.959
ectotherms from the Northern Latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:52.719
For example, in Ireland there are no snakes because the place was wiped clean by an ice sheet and

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.719
snakes haven't managed to get back to the island yet.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:02.140
My point is the distribution of species depends on what happened. It may be an unsatisfying explanation,

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:06.849
but I'd rather know the truth than just believe in a trend that's not actually there.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:08.450
Really?

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:09.550
[you're] a decimal

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.800
What do you think is gonna happen to the spot on the screen

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.830
as I narrow...  The color of the blue morpho is created by the

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.910
structure of its scales

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:18.940
Which is what you do - butterflies?

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:25.510
But see all your organs [are] where the signs are getting lost - wings makes mathletes [a] trap the light and if you should not

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:26.540
flare out

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.260
Would never realize with the size learns and certainty [prints] directed alert so...

00:10:30.265 --> 00:10:33.740
As I started to go through this big investigation,

00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:40.240
I realize just how complicated this is and how many mysteries are still out there. For example,

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:44.199
why are some species deadly venomous and in others the venom is

00:10:44.199 --> 00:10:47.270
is pretty weak, and I didn't end up with anything.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:53.989
The deadly guys turned out to have ecologies that are very similar to the guys with very weak venom and

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.919
it may be a historical accident. Another strange observation

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:05.080
is that a lot of snakes that have evolved more recently have actually lost the ability to produce venom. The big success story in snakes

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.440
worldwide are the harmless ones. They've actually evolved from venomous snakes

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.729
Venom is an ancestral characteristic in modern snakes. The

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.269
successful snakes are the ones that left it behind and they gave it up

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.790
and they're proliferated despite not having venom,

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.130
Apparently the cost of making venom isn't much more than the cost of

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.890
making saliva.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:30.739
So it seems curious that they would lose what seems to be a killer advantage over other species.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:35.050
If you have thoughts about this or any other mysteries regarding the global

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:38.360
distribution of venomous species put them in the comments below.
