00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.940
When you touch an object and it feels warm
or cold, what is that really telling you about

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.940
the object?

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.700
Here, I have a metal hard drive and a book
and I'm going to ask people to compare their

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.280
temperatures.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.570
Which one do you think will feel warmer - the
book or the hard drive?

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.570
The temperatures?

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.939
Yeah, tell me if one is hotter or colder or
if they're the same temperature.

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.580
How do they feel?

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.080
This is slightly cooler than this one.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.349
Oh, that's warmer.

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:26.349
Yeah, agreed.

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.599
I'd say the hard drive is a lot colder than
the book.

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.840
'Cause the book's got more knowledge.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.160
Why do you think that is?

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.210
Metal's normally a little bit chillier if
you leave it in a colder temperature.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.770
What if I said they're both the same temperature?

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.770
What would you say?

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.170
I'd tell you you're lying.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.390
I'd think you were lying, yeah.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.640
Well, maybe the way I can prove it is I have
an infrared thermometer.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.480
What do you think we're going to see?

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.890
I think science might be able to answer that.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.190
And I'm not a scientist!

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.420
Make a prediction for me.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.030
I still think that's colder.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.510
Would you bet me money?

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.010
I don't have any cash.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.560
Let's measure the temperature of the book.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.470
What do you see?

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.470
19.0.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.470
OK.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.390
Now measure the temperature of that.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.390
19.0.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.090
Alright, well, now I believe you.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.330
I'm trying to figure it out, actually.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.890
Trying to figure out why'd they be the same
temperature.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.270
They don't feel the same temperature, though.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.250
So, why does that feel colder if they're the
same?

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.250
Good one.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.270
You know the answer?

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.470
I'm coming to you guys for answers.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.470
We're creatives, not intellectuals.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.350
Well, create an answer for me!

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.610
I'm not a scientist!

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.440
Come on, you tell me.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.390
I'll try to answer that question with another
little experiment.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.780
Here is an aluminium block.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.780
Ooh!

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.780
Nice and cold.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.740
And a plastic block.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.340
How do their temperatures compare?

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.360
Completely different.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.590
Aluminium's going to be much colder.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.590
Yeah?

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.590
This actually feels colder.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.909
Let's take this to the next level.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.840
I'll put an ice cube on both plates.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.630
What will we see?

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.450
I'm guessing it would stay solid on this one
and melt on this one.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.310
So it's going to melt on the plastic but stay
solid on the aluminium?

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.269
Yes, but maybe I'm wrong.

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.299
That one will melt more quickly than on the
aluminium.

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:12.440
You'd think so.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.959
Yeah, 'cause it's cold.

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.719
I think they're the same.

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.969
We put an ice cube on each of those.

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:19.109
What do you see?

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:20.980
It's melting quicker on the aluminium.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.469
My God, it's melting!

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:26.889
This is melting quicker than that one, even
though this is aluminium and that's plastic.

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:27.999
So which one felt colder?

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:28.999
This one.

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:31.319
How does that make sense?

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.319
No idea.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.750
Could aluminium be bad for the environment?

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.639
How would aluminium be bad for the environment?

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.680
It's thawing the ice quicker, isn't it?

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.469
You want the answer?

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:42.069
Yes, please!

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.910
It's about thermoconductivity - the rate at
which heat is transferred from one object

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.980
to another.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.019
So when you felt these blocks originally,
I know this one felt a lot colder.

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.810
But you know from the other example we did,
that they must both be the same temperature.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.810
True.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.560
They've both been outside for a while.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.260
We see the aluminium block is melting the
ice faster than the plastic block because

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.870
it's conducting the heat to the ice cube faster.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.920
With the plastic block, it's a worse thermoconductor.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.769
So, heat is being transferred less quickly
to this ice block and so it's staying iced.

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:13.769
OK.

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:14.769
I believe you.

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:15.769
Make sense?

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:16.769
Yes.

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:17.769
Definitely.

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.599
In our first example, the hard drive felt
colder, even though it was at the same temperature

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:22.889
as the book.

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:27.239
That's because the aluminium conducts heat
away from your hand faster than the book conducts

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.239
heat away from your hand.

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.239
Sure.

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.239
That seems logical.

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.430
Which makes the hard drive feel colder and
the book feel warmer.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.530
So when you touch something, you don't actually
feel temperature.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.449
You feel the rate at which heat is conducted,
either towards or away from you.

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:45.129
Think about this next time you hop out of
the shower in winter.

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.269
It's much nicer to stand on the bath mat than
on a towel beside it.

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.900
Not because the bath mat is warmer but because
it conducts heat less quickly away from you.
