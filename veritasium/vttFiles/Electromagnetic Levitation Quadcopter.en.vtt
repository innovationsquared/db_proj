00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
How much does this thing weigh?

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.040
-Well, try to pick it up.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.520
-Okay.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.220
Alright.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.440
-Be nice to it

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.720
-105 lbs
-105 lbs

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.380
-It consists of four motors connected up to these spinning magnet arrays

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.140
and if you spin these fast enough it will actually levitate.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.220
-That's correct.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.680
-Let's see if we can do it

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.940
Ready?

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.260
Let's fire it up

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.100
-It's lifting.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.540
-Okay, it's flying now.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.280
-Is it?

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.540
-Yeah, definitely.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.160
-Now it is so easy to just move around

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.700
That's amazing.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.120
-Give it a push. Like, it's got some real-

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.920
-Wow.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.120
It can carry some weight, eh?
-Yeah

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.840
-That is amazing.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.480
So how does it work?

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.880
Well, it's similar to how a magnet falling through a pipe is slowed down

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.620
Anytime a conductor experiences a changing magnetic field

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.320
electric currents are induced in it which create a magnetic field to oppose that change

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.020
And in this case the spinning magnets induce currents in the copper sheet.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.480
They create a magnetic field which is nearly a mirror image of the spinning magnets

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.080
and so they're repelled.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.400
If the rotors spin fast enough, this repulsion leads to levitation.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.660
That is awesome.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.660
-Let's shut it down now
-Yep

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.660
-It's just gonna come

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.660
gently land.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.220
-The induced currents then encounter resistance in the copper

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.520
so they dissipate their energy as heat.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.260
Whoa.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.940
And this copper is pretty hot.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.200
- It's gotten warmer. Yeah, I can still keep my hand on it.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.480
At least for a second or two.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.800
- But it is like a hot mug of coffee or something

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.120
I experienced this before with another electromagnetic levitation device.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.660
Except with this one the changing magnetic field was created by an electromagnet in the base

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.020
inducing currents in a light aluminum plate which levitated.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.480
Whoa!

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.320
The plate got so hot you could boil water on it.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.720
Check how hot this plate is.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.480
If you have two north magnets facing each other,

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.560
they normally just kinda like fall off.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.100
-Yeah.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.860
Is there a similar problem here or not?

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.500
-Not really. No.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.820
And the reason is: the magnetic fields that are induced by currents in the copper sheet

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.040
are a mirror image of the applied magnetic fields.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.960
And the effect is so quick that as it moves it just kind of follows it around.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.060
- Making this device work in practice is harder than it looks.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.060
For one thing the magnetic field of the permanent magnets has to be very strong.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.360
Neodymium magnets are strong, but there's a special configuration

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.920
you can use to make them even stronger.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.480
- It's called a Halbach array.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.060
They're used in particle accelerators.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.840
They're used in fridge magnets, actually -

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.620
Halbach arrays, so they're stronger on the side that sticks to the fridge.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.580
So they use less material, overall.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.040
- Magnetic field lines run from north to south.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.000
They're normally symmetric on both sides of a magnet.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.760
But if you rearrange them like this

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.260
the magnetic field lines are channeled almost entirely into one side of the magnetic array.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.760
And they cancel out on the other side.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.580
This configuration produces a much stronger magnetic field,

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.900
without changing the properties of the magnets.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.880
In these rotors there are 12 wedge-shaped magnets.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.880
The magnetic poles are fixed in this particular arrangement.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.260
This increases the magnetic field on the bottom side and

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.412
almost eliminates it on the top.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.640
As the magnets spin they create a rotating magnetic field in the copper beneath them.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.460
This induces currents that create magnetic fields

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.780
which oppose the magnetic field of the spinning magnets above.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.980
The result is a repulsive force that is effectively lift for this quadcopter.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.120
But in addition to lift there is also drag.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.300
Energy is clearly being dissipated in the system

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.280
as the heat produced by the induced currents and the copper.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.940
That energy comes from the fact that magnetic of the induced current

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.980
is not a perfect mirror of the spinning magnets above.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.700
Instead the induced magnetic poles are slightly ahead.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.220
So they produce a backward force on the rotors

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.360
which is really a backwards torque

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.680
and that's why the rotors on alternate corners have to spin in opposite directions

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.060
Because otherwise they would produce a net spin

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.680
and turn the whole machine in one direction.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.560
This way they cancel out.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.640
This principle has been used to achieve levitation

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.840
in everything from Maglev trains to hover boards.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.800
And it's being considered as a means to make the Hyperloop.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.480
A super fast system for transporting people and goods

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.640
through tubes at very low pressure.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.280
But instead of spinning the magnets, the vehicles motion itself

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.220
would cause the magnetic field to change in the conductive track below.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.900
So in the future you think this is gonna be how we travel?

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.480
- I think ongoing developments in digital motor controllers and very powerful magnets

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.880
will mean that talking about moving humans and cargo at extremely high speeds

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.880
is actually something that we can as a species kind of look at,

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.540
and be like: wow!

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.840
It turns out that getting from one city to another city in the same day

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.560
is something that the next billion or two billion people might have the option to do in one lifetime.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.640

by Ashlee Vance.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:46.580
This is a biography about one of the - in my view - most impressive entrepreneurs alive today.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.000
This book was written by interviewing hundreds of his employees,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.160
his acquaintances and Elon Musk himself

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.640
So it provides a really in-depth and thorough look at

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.340
that incredible determination that's made possible all of Elon Musk's ventures.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.720
So if you're intrigued by him and his work

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.360
