00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
shall I put this down?

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.171
yeah of course. ahhh alright we're about to do some welding

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.580
go on

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.270
here on earth if you want to get two

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.180
metals to fuse you have to heat them up

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.940
past their melting point

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.050
but in space

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.419
it's a different story as we found out

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.700
the hard way

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.520
on the third of june nineteen sixty-five

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.710
astronaut ed white conducted the first

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.530
ever American spacewalk aboard gemini

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.770
four tethered via a long gold plated hose

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.660
he propelled himself outside the capsule

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.030
by shooting pressurized oxygen from a

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.000
handheld gun. He enjoyed it so much

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.290
that's flight control literally had to

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.140
order him back into the spacecraft.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.520
-The flight director said get back in. -Back in? Back in.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.330
Roger, we've been trying to talk to you for a while here

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.610
returning to the vehicle he commented it

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.379
was the saddest moment of his life

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.020
little did he know what would happen

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.710
next

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.570
inside the spacecraft the crew was faced

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.270
with a problem - The hatch would not close

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.380
for about an hour

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.210
there was no word from gemini IV

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.410
-He said he was busy and he'd rather not talk to us. Flying over Africa they actually went

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.060
out of range of communication with the

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.840
ground

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.030
-Gemini IV, Houston Capcom, give me your status

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.000
But after a lot of wrenching and brute

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.520
force they got it closed and everything was fine.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.740
The original mission called for

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.600
another depressurization where they

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.190
would open up the hatch and throw away a

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.380
bunch of bulky gear, things they needed

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.600
only for the spacewalk. But the pilot

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.670
McDivitt radioed to say that under no

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.229
circumstances were they going to open

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.330
the hatch again. Flight thought it was

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.890
because the astronauts wanted to keep

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.500
the EVA suit and gas guns as souvenirs.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.600
The astronauts eventually return to

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.160
Earth safely with the extra gear

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.500
literally stuffed into the footwells of

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.319
their cramped craft. So what caused the

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:55.959
hatch to stick? Well NASA engineers at

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:57.789
the time identified that the failure was

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.229
due to something called cold welding.

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.640
You see, in space if two metals come into

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.780
contact they can actually fuse together

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.840
without the need for heat or melting of

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.789
either piece. And the reason for this is

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.680
due to the fundamental structure of

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.930
metals which is a little bit like this

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.569
candy bar in that they contain a lattice

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.910
of positively charged ions, like the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.490
peanuts embedded in a sea of freely

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.620
moving negative electrons like the

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.380
caramel. Now here on earth the surface

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.270
layers of a metal react with the oxygen

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.209
in the atmosphere to create a protective

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.270
oxide layer and this actually prevents

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.189
two pieces of metal from joining

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.760
together. But in space this oxide layer

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.730
can be worn away

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.200
like if two pieces of metal aren't

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.110
sliding over each other as in hinges and

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.840
then the bare pieces of metal with a

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.110
little bit of force or impact can

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.709
actually fuse together so the electrons

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.330
from one piece of metal can flow into

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.060
the other. In this business, as Richard Feinmann

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.459
put it, the atoms have no way of

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.230
knowing that they're in different pieces.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.290
This obviously has huge implications for

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.730
the construction and maintenance of

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.530
spacecraft like the International Space

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.400
Station.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.230
So why don't we hear about more

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.970
disasters like this happening in space

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:17.900
all the time?

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.269
I mean why isn't the ISS already a big

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:21.799
welded mess?

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.019
Well the truth is the cold welding is

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.579
not as big of a problem as scientists

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.640
originally thought it was.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.380
I mean experiments on the ground in vacuum

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.940
chambers and in space have shown that

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.010
perfectly clean metal surfaces when

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.420
pressed together in the absence of

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.170
atmosphere will weld together. But in

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.060
practice the metals that are used in

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.090
spacecraft are never that clean, I mean

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.980
they have those oxide layers on them not

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.380
to mention other contaminants, dirt and

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.480
grease and it would take a long time for

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.819
all of those things to be eliminated so

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.819
that bare metal touches in space so the

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.280
Gemini IV hatch problem was not

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.950
actually caused by cold welding, it was

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.410
just a sticky door. But that's not to say

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.630
that cold welding never happens. For

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.970
example in 1991 the Galileo spacecraft

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.849
was on its way to Jupiter. Now, when

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.400
scientists tried to unfurl its high gain

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.139
antenna which was meant to open like an

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.979
umbrella it got stuck. Three of the 18

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:22.010
ribs of the antenna refused to open and

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.419
this was due in part to the fact that

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.760
they were cold welded, the pins were

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.919
stuck in place and nothing the

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.410
scientists could do would open it and so

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.020
in the end they have to scramble to find

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.240
a way to use the low gain antenna to

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.130
send back data from Jupiter, something

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.430
that it was never meant to do.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.860
A 2009 report by the European Space Agency

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.910
recommended three main ways to reduce

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.639
the risks of cold welding. Number one -

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.219
where possible use plastics or ceramics

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:52.050
to avoid sliding metal on metal contacts.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.150
Second, if you have to use metal and

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.770
metal try to use two different metals,

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.169
maybe two different metal alloys because

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.169
that reduces the risks of those metals

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.020
melding together. And third, use durable

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.060
coatings that resists wear to avoid

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.699
bare metal on metal contact. The cold

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.009
welding is not always a bad thing.

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:12.090
Scientists have actually found it

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.430
incredibly useful in fabricating

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.620
nanotechnology. You know, traditional

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.870
welding techniques used on that sort of

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.449
tiny scale can often go wrong because

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.580
you're trying to pinpoint heat onto tiny

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.650
nanowires and you can end up pretty

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.229
quickly with a melted mess on your hands.

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.659
So in conditions very similar to the

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:32.759
vacuum of outer space scientists have

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.009
shown that single crystal gold nano

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.740
wires fused to each other in seconds

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.960
using no heat, just the cold welding

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.780
technique and those welds are perfect

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.370
the crystalline structure is identical

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.370
to the rest of the nanowire as are the

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.250
mechanical and electrical properties.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.560
So although cold welding is a bit of a

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.900
potential problem in space, it's actually

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.360
incredibly useful here on earth to

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.650
manufacture nanotechnology.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.169

book i would recommend to you is called

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.770
a man on the moon by Andrew Chaikin and

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.840
this is the story all about the Apollo

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.870
missions to put people on the moon, of

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.639
course Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin,

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:37.349
the first ones to get there.

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:39.300
In fact the astronauts call this book

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.270
the definitive account of their tail so
