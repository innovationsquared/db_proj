00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.530
- Can I tell you something I'm bad at?

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.500
I am terrible at making clickbait.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.650
Up until two years ago,

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.110
my most popular video
was about a basketball

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.010
being dropped from a dam
with a bit of backspin.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.400
It takes off like a rocket and shoots out

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.560
way further than you'd expect.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.190
This video was embedded

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.700
on literally hundreds of news websites.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.320
And in its first week, it
got 16.3 million views,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.200
but almost none of those views
came on the YouTube platform.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.130
Why?

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.560
Because I gave it this thumbnail

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.917
and I called it "Strange
Applications of the Magnus Effect."

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.630
This video is sponsored by KiwiCo.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.120
More about them at the end of the show.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.610
Now, I believe within YouTube,

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.240
I'm used as an example of how
not to package your video.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.880
As if to demonstrate just how bad

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.320
a title and thumbnail this is,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.137
someone else re-uploaded the
video with the clever title,

00:00:53.137 --> 00:00:55.550
"Basketball Dropped From Dam."

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.240
And within a few weeks,
that video had received

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.010
tens of millions of views on YouTube.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.410
This is when YouTube gave
me access to ContentID.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.560
That's the system that
allows you to earn revenue

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.890
when someone else re-uploads
your videos, which was good,

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.740
but I still wasn't very good at clickbait.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.730
So for this video, I called in an expert.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.650
I wanted to see your reaction face.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.970
Can you give me like a reaction face?

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.100
Like what's a good thumbnail face?

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.150
- Oh, I got you.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.096
This is a thumbnail face.

00:01:22.096 --> 00:01:24.220
(Derek laughs)

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.285
I have like 10, I go through
the motions of like...

00:01:28.285 --> 00:01:30.065
(Derek laughs)

00:01:30.065 --> 00:01:31.060
And then we just take the best one,

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.560
I probably have like
500 of these just saved

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.290
and we can just Photoshop
my face on my face.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.360
That way, I don't have to do it anymore.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.460
- When I started on this
platform, some 10 years ago,

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.120
clickbait was less important.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.090
Subscribers were what mattered,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.800
because most of the views
came from the sub feed.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.480
And videos went viral usually

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.090
by getting a lot of attention elsewhere,

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.000
like on Reddit or Facebook,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.860
not due to the YouTube algorithm.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.810
But once you had a big
video and people subscribed,

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.080
well, then your next video
would likely get a lot of views

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.280
from those subscribers.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.210
So YouTube would take that popular video

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.420
and share it with more people.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.720
And so you'd get more subscribers

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.240
in a positive feedback loop.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.020
But soon, YouTube realized
that this did not create

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.110
the best experience for the viewer.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.050
They discovered that
showing people only videos

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.240
from channels they were
subscribed to led to fewer clicks,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.690
less watch time and less engagement

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.250
with the site as a whole.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.250
Plus, they knew that
relying on other platforms

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.800
to drive traffic to viral hits was risky,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.560
since those other platforms might disable

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.230
the traffic at any time.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.990
So they needed to make YouTube
a destination in itself.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.000
They wanted people to come to YouTube,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.900
see videos that interested them,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.620
click on at least one of them
and watch it for a while.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.430
Ideally get sucked down
the YouTube rabbit hole

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.770
and spend hours on the site
without even noticing it.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.960
The ultimate resource is people's time

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.620
and attention, and every platform

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.430
is trying to capture as
much of it as possible.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.690
So, to make YouTube
this go-to destination,

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.420
they had decrease the
importance of subscribers,

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.160
make it less like a podcast app

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
where you only get the
shows you're subscribed to,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.530
and more like Reddit,

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.260
where stuff with the most
engagement rises to the top.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.430
But that necessarily meant increasing

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.740
the importance of clickbait.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.850
Now, there seems to be a paradox
when it comes to clickbait.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.130
People almost universally
claim to hate it,

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.850
but you also see it everywhere.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.600
So why is this?

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.740
Well, one of the problems
is we don't all agree

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.390
on the definition of clickbait.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.900
When I google it, the top definition is,

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.240
on the internet, content
whose main purpose

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.790
is to attract attention
and encourage visitors

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.360
to click on a link to
a particular webpage.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.050
We could call this type I clickbait,

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.410
and there doesn't seem to
be anything wrong with it.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.980
I mean, if you didn't
try to attract attention

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.280
and get people to click on your links,

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.400
then you wouldn't really
be doing your job.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.290
But there is a second definition.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.950
One that I think more people ascribe to,

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.410
which is something such
as a headline designed

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.760
to make readers want to
click on a hyperlink,

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.820
especially when the link leads to content

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.280
of dubious value or interest.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.090
Wikipedia says, "A defining
characteristic of clickbait

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.980
is that it is sensationalized
or misleading."

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.820
And it also talks about teasers

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.520
that intentionally withhold information

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.640
to exploit the "curiosity gap."

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.200
They give you enough
information to make you curious,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.330
but not enough to satisfy that curiosity.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.060
Here are two actual titles
from a news website.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.730
Nine out of 10 Americans
are completely wrong

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.200
about this mind blowing fact.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.630
And someone gave some kids some scissors.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.920
Here's what happened next.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.950
I think we can all agree
that these are examples

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.453
of bad type II clickbait.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.170
Now, imagine a clickbait
space where on one axis,

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.630
you have how misleading
or sensationalized it is.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.630
And on the other, how much information

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.880
is intentionally withheld
to create a curiosity gap.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.180
Well, then these two titles
fall in the top right corner.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.740
And these are the zones
of type II clickbait.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.710
At the other extreme,

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.730
you have things that are so
unsensationalized as to be dull.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.550
You could call this the dead zone.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.727
Now, here is where you would find

00:05:07.727 --> 00:05:10.650
"Strange applications
of the Magnus Effect."

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.750
I mean, I didn't tell you
what the applications were.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.980
Now, in the middle is where you
would find type I clickbait.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.230
But honestly, I think type
I and type II clickbait

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.440
are so different, that
we shouldn't even use

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.990
the same word for them.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.600
Instead of type I clickbait,

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.440
my friend and YouTuber, Brady
Heron suggested legitbait.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.310
I mean, it might sound
enticing, but it is legit.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.730
Instead of type II clickbait,

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.730
we could use clicktrap,
clicktrick, linktrap or dupechute.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.940
What's important to recognize
is that for any given video,

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.170
there is no one true title and thumbnail.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.760
Each video could have
hundreds or thousands

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.760
of different legitbait titles.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.070
For example, how does a zero-G plane work?

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.440
I went on a plane that does
parabolic trajectories.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.970
What happens to fire on a zero-G plane?

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.160
Now, the most enticing
titles and thumbnails

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.150
are found close to type II clickbait.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.560
I'm reminded of the infographic
by smarter every day,

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.270
showing that on social media,

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.620
the greatest engagement
occurs close to the boundary

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.950
of what's allowable.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.430
But remember that everyone's
definition of clickbait

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.260
is different, and everyone's perceptions

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.970
of words and images are different.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.850
So these are not clear boundaries.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.200
They're actually kind of fuzzy.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.270
What for one person might be legitbait,

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.240
for someone else, could be a clicktrap.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.040
What's clear is that on a site

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.960
where click-through rate is important,

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.270
clickbait of all types is inevitable.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.760
How important to a video's success

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.000
is the title and thumbnail?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.430
- Very important. Of course.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.263
If they don't click on the video,

00:06:42.263 --> 00:06:43.430
they don't watch it.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.907
You can't get 10 million views

00:06:45.907 --> 00:06:48.100
unless 10 million people
click on the video.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.930
So, I mean, it's literally that simple.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.630
They don't click on it,
they don't watch it.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.090
- So, why is clickbait everywhere?

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.300
Well, because it works.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.700
More enticing thumbnails get more clicks.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.230
Despite some people's claims

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.430
that they won't click or they'll unsub,

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.950
it's just like evolution.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.100
Whatever survives, multiplies
and traits become amplified.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.720
If you don't begrudge
the giraffe its long neck

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.630
so it can reach the highest leaves,

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.070
can you begrudge a YouTuber the red arrow

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.870
that allows them to
reach further audiences?

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.000
I talked about this in
my video two years ago.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.540
To be successful as a YouTuber,

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.440
you need to optimize two things,

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.140
watch time and the click-through
rate of your videos.

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.460
That's the number of times

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.730
the title and thumbnail are clicked,

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.000
divided by the total number
of times they're shown.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.130
That's the number of impressions.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:34.963
Now at the time,

00:07:34.963 --> 00:07:37.140
this was something of a revelation for me

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.910
because I always thought my
job was to make great videos.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.210
And then a title and thumbnail

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.840
that adequately represented
what the video was about.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.640
But now I've realized that
making the title and thumbnail

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.220
is at least half the job.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.570
This is not just because
better titles and thumbnails

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:52.700
get you more clicks,

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.140
but because better titles and thumbnails

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.160
will get you way more impressions.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.260
YouTube has limited real estate

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.280
with which to show you
virtually infinite content.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.350
And so it's not enough
to make a good video

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.130
even if people watch all of it,

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.270
you also have to make
a title and thumbnail

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.140
that gets clicked,
especially in competition

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.700
with other really good
titles and thumbnails.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.440
That's the only way you can expect YouTube

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.548
to give you more impressions.

00:08:16.548 --> 00:08:19.280
Now, the big development
since my last video on this

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.780
is YouTube introduced real-time metrics

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.303
like views, impressions
and click-through rate.

00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:26.770
Now, I suggested this
would create an arms race.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:28.470
So what you can bet will happen

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.680
is that creators will launch a video

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.690
and then they'll be sitting there

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.640
with all these different
variants of thumbnails

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.380
and they'll be swapping them out

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.030
and looking at what that
does to click-through rate

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.740
and then going with the one

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.610
that leads to the greatest
click-through rate.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.210
And this is basically what has happened.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.410
Let me give you my favorite example.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.020
Last year, I made a video about asteroids,

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.710
which I thought was really good.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.930
I called it "Asteroids:
Earth's Biggest Threat,"

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.650
which is something Stephen Hawking said.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.930
And people were very
positive about the video.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.200
They thought it was maybe one of my best,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.950
but the performance
was well below average.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.720
In its first day,
asteroids was ranked ninth

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.080
out of my previous 10 videos.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.480
It was probably on target

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.070
for about one and a half million views.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.270
So I tried different titles and thumbnails

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.130
like, "Asteroid Impact:
What Are Our Chances?"

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.820
Or "Asteroid Impact: What Could We Do?"

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.850
But none of these changes
got much traction.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.520
And then on day three after launch,

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.010
I changed the title and thumbnail

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.650
to "These Are the
Asteroids to Worry About."

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:33.480
And immediately the video
started doing better.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.980
It quickly shot up from almost
my worst performing video

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.720
to my best.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.030
It now has 14 million views.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.790
Nothing about the video changed,

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:47.130
just that one image and 38 characters.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.180
But because of that, the video has reached

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.820
nearly 10 times as many people
as it otherwise would have.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.100
And the title and thumbnail
accurately describe

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.490
what the video is about.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:58.700
I mean, sure, there's a curiosity gap,

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.740
but you couldn't explain the whole concept

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.550
in the length of the title.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.550
So if you see a YouTuber
changing titles and thumbnails,

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.070
this is why.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:10.250
Because that effort can be
rewarded many times over.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.020
I've seen people
objecting to this practice

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.380
because they think the creator

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.730
is trying to dupe their audience,

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.700
get them to click on the
same video more than once,

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.780
but that's not it.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.410
The whole point is to get YouTube

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.610
to show the title and
thumbnail to more people.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:25.650
We're trying to increase
the number of impressions,

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:28.630
which is heavily dependent
on the click-through rate.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:32.470
Now, a lot of my recent videos
have this typical view curve.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.690
There's an initial spike
after I release the video

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.020
and then a dip, and then a second bump

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.130
after I have figured out a
better title and thumbnail.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:41.580
I change the title and thumbnail

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.150
and I watch the real time view graph.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.480
What I'm looking for is a
noticeable bump in views.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.050
Sometimes there's no change,
sometimes it gets worse,

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.720
but on occasions, when you
see something like this,

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.520
well then, you know you've found a winner.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.810
This is something all the
big YouTubers are doing.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:00.430
Not even Mr. Beast knows exactly

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.899
which thumbnail will work best beforehand.

00:11:02.899 --> 00:11:05.747
Have you ever changed
a title and thumbnail

00:11:05.747 --> 00:11:06.580
and then the video did better?

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.760
- Oh, of course.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.290
So everybody, I usually make
like two or three thumbnails,

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.000
and then if it's not
doing as well as I want,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.262
we usually just swap 'em out
and see if it does better.

00:11:15.262 --> 00:11:17.700
'cause the thing is like,
you don't really know.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.190
I mean, you could know if you
just were an almighty being

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.800
that could just predict what
people would be interested in,

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.280
but you know, usually...

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.350
Like, you can do hide and seek.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.810
You don't really know if
like you hiding in a tree

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:30.850
and then someone walking
below you is a good thumbnail.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:33.350
Or if you hiding a trash can and
them walking in front of you.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:34.750
So, you know, just do both

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.210
and then see which one interests
people a little bit more.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:38.043
- I feel the same way,

00:11:38.043 --> 00:11:40.190
but I do feel like you have a better sense

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.080
of this than like most people.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.913
- Of course.

00:11:42.913 --> 00:11:45.592
I mean, no one gets 40
million views a video.

00:11:45.592 --> 00:11:47.300
(both laughing)

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.360
- But what is the point
in getting more views?

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.193
If you're cynical,

00:11:51.193 --> 00:11:53.810
you might say it's all
about money and fame.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:56.080
And while there are certainly
financial incentives

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.860
to getting more views,
that's not why I do it.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.360
As an educational YouTuber,

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.370
I think there are two very good reasons

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.840
for using excellent type I clickbait

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.110
over more straightforward packaging.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:08.550
To understand the first reason,

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.710
let's consider two
different possible titles

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.360
for my most recent video.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.020
I called it "The Simplest Math
Problem No One Can Solve,"

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.350
but it's a video about
the Collatz conjecture.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.470
So perhaps a more straightforward title

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:22.810
would have been simply to call it that.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:24.570
The problem is, if I publish a video

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:26.500
called the Collatz conjecture,

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.450
the most likely people to click on it

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:31.647
are those who already know
what the Collatz conjecture is.

00:12:31.647 --> 00:12:34.750
And the vast majority of people
will never have heard of it.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.210
So for them, the title is meaningless

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.020
and only the very curious

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.800
or those who really like
Veritasium would click.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.230
In contrast, calling it
"The Simplest Math Problem

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.830
No One Can Solve,"
conveys more information

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.800
about the video to everyone.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.780
And this means more
people can click on it,

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.280
most of whom will never have heard

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.320
of the Collatz conjecture.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.852
So I get to teach them something new.

00:12:55.852 --> 00:12:58.790
And since the video has a
higher click-through rate,

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:01.000
YouTube shows it to even more people.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.110
So if my aim is to increase
the level of knowledge

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:06.940
in the world by the
maximum amount possible,

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.660
this is the way to do it.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.050
The second reason we need to
optimize titles and thumbnails

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.920
is to support the major
goal of this channel.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.120
We are trying to make
the best science films

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.040
on every topic we tackle.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.480
That means traveling to meet
experts in film experiments,

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.410
hiring people to build props,

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:28.420
make spectacular animations,
research and fact check.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.320
We hire expert consultants

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.700
to double and triple check our work.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.110
I don't wanna make vlogs.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.260
I wanna make science
documentaries on YouTube

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.220
that put broadcast to shame.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.480
And to make this possible and sustainable,

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.360
the videos have to get
views and lots of them.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.740
And to do that, we have to make

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.360
the best titles and thumbnails we can.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.590
YouTuber and Patreon CEO, Jack Conte

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:52.000
has talked about adjusting your packaging.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.310
The idea is know what
you're passionate about,

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.000
what you won't compromise on

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.270
and that stuff goes in the box.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.740
All the rest, like what
paper it's wrapped in,

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.190
that's the packaging.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.780
So the video is my focus
and the title and thumbnail

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.110
are the packaging that
I'm happy to adjust,

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.200
so I can make the type of
videos that are important to me.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.590
Now, is it ironic that a
channel whose whole purpose

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:14.420
is to promote a true seeking mindset

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.170
has to experiment at the
edge of what is truthful

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:18.940
in order to fulfill that purpose?

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.920
It is something that I
often worry about.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.880
You know, when I did like
risking my life to do X,

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.480
it's like, well, what probability of death

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.390
does there have to be for
you to risk your life?

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:29.957
Like 50%?

00:14:29.957 --> 00:14:32.692
- I love how he always overthinks things.

00:14:32.692 --> 00:14:33.953
(laughs)
That's funny.

00:14:33.953 --> 00:14:36.433
He's like, is my life risked enough

00:14:36.433 --> 00:14:38.520
where I can put I risked my life?

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.250
I only had a 9% chance of dying

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.200
and I need at least a 13% chance.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.350
You're so funny.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:44.950
He was the same way two years ago

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.190
when he asked me all this stuff.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:49.690
I was like, "Dude, just do
whatever makes the most sense.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.390
- Yeah, I mean, obviously
I feel like my instincts

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:53.590
are not good.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:54.530
But what I realized

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.430
is that I don't have
to trust my instincts.

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:01.460
This problem of getting the
best title and thumbnail,

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.700
well, it's a scientific problem.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.740
We're just asking which accurate
representation of the video

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.610
will get the most clicks
from a general audience.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:10.730
And that's a problem we can use

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.810
the scientific method to solve.

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.780
So I've hired a couple
of really bright people

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.740
and we spend a lot of time brainstorming

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.620
and making titles and
thumbnails and testing them out.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.770
For example, on Twitter and Patreon.

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.090
Varitasium titles and
thumbnails have gotten better,

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.970
not because I'm better at it,

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:28.530
but because of my team and our testing.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.610
If you have ideas about
how we could do it better,

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.270
please get in touch.

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.860
The results have often
contradicted what I expected.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.890
I mean, this video seemed
to perform 10% better

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:40.750
when we excluded the word
surprising from the title.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:44.500
So it became simply The
Secret of Synchronization.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.480
I thought these two titles
were basically a toss up,

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.220
but Patreon had a strong
preference for one over the other.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.960
What's interesting about this research

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.020
is that the more clickable
titles and thumbnails

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.720
often better represent
the content of the video.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.770
Let me give you some examples.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:01.900
One thing I didn't expect
when YouTube brought in

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.420
the real time analytics tools

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.930
and allowed title and thumbnail changes

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:06.660
to affect impressions,

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.400
was that it would also
work for older videos.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.127
So here is an old video
that I originally entitled,

00:16:12.127 --> 00:16:15.520
"Why the Neutron is the
Hero of Nuclear Physics."

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.840
In hindsight, it's a weird,
kinda meaningless title.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.600
So I changed it to, "Why Einstein Thought

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.800
Nuclear Weapons Impossible."

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.870
It's clearer, more accurate.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:30.510
And this is what happened
to views after the change.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:33.380
I changed "Strange Applications
of the Magnus Effect"

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.640
to "Backspin Basketball Flies Off Dam."

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.830
Again, more accurate.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.830
And the video is now
being watched on YouTube.

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:42.850
Probably 10 million more views

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.720
than it otherwise would have had.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.440
Even anti-clickbait has proven effective.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.367
Here's a video I originally titled,

00:16:49.367 --> 00:16:51.600
"Are Negative Ions Good For You?"

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.050
Which is a question nobody asked ever.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:58.647
Now, I changed it to,
"Do Salt Lamps Work?"

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.400
Seriously.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.933
And here's the result:

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.940
One and a half million more views.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.620
I think looking at these examples,

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:10.930
you could easily make the case

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.980
that YouTube has made
me better at what I do.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.060
It has improved the clarity and accuracy

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.320
of my titles and thumbnails.
It's helped me figure out

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.670
what is interesting to my audience

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.120
and how to encapsulate
that in a single image

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.230
and fewer than 50 characters.

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.180
For those of you who worry that a focus

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.720
on titles and thumbnails will prevent me

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.580
from picking challenging science topics,

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.010
well, I simply ask you
to look at the videos

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:34.440
from the last year or two,

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.580
like the ones on Gödel's
incompleteness theorem,

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.560
general relativity, Penrose tilings,

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.720
the logistic map, Newton's
method of calculating Pi,

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.640
the one way speed of light.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.850
Good titles and thumbnails
make it possible

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:48.610
to tackle these topics
and to reach more people

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.790
who have heard of them before.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.630
There is a symbiotic relationship

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:55.160
between views and video quality.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.980
The more views we get, the more people,

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.100
locations, props and equipment

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.290
and research we can invest in.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.440
This makes the next video
better than the last.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.620
If we can be good at
titles and thumbnails,

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.580
the ultimate outcome is better videos.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:13.213
That is something I think
you and I both want.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.090
Hey, this video is sponsored by KiwiCo,

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:22.120
a long time supporter of the channel.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.760
Now KiwiCo makes awesome
hands on projects for kids,

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.400
including big kids like me.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.760
They have eight subscription lines

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.390
targeted at different age groups,

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:31.010
all the way down to newborns.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:32.390
What I love about KiwiCo crates

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:33.710
is that they make learning fun

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:35.200
and something to look forward to.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.900
I mean, when I pull out a crate,

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.470
my kids just jump at the
chance to make it with me.

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:42.270
And all the materials you
need come right in the box.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:43.970
So there's no need to run to the store.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.940
You just open it up and go.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.520
My kids and I just built
this domino machine,

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.870
which, who knows, might be
inspiration for a viral video.

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.440
Now, the big idea is that
while playing and having fun,

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.810
kids learn about STEAM concepts.

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.890
That is science, technology,
engineering, art and math.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.180
And in addition to the project,

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.900
there's a magazine with a lot
of additional information.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.890
So I think this is the best way to learn.

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:09.220
By doing something
yourself and having fun,

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.200
it's how education should be.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.210
So if you wanna try it out,

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:14.720
go to Kiwico.com/veritasium50,

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.610
and you'll get 50% off your
first month of any crate.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.610
I will put that link
down in the description.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:22.160
So I wanna thank KiwiCo
for sponsoring Veritasium,

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.568
and I wanna thank you for watching.
