00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
- This is the world's strongest magnet,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.190
capable of sucking objects in,

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.870
generating electric current.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.160
Can you see that?

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.310
And levitating non-magnetic objects.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.220
It even wreaks havoc on camera equipment.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.770
- Wire is magnetic!
- So if it's a CMOS sensor,

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.630
the electrons just can't find their way.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.650
- Well, they get redirected.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.440
- So yeah, if you notice
bad video or audio,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.850
know that it's incredibly hard

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.790
to shoot in these magnetic fields.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.190
A portion of this video
was sponsored by Google.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.610
I came to the National High
Magnetic Field Laboratory

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.760
in Tallahassee, Florida,
where since the year 2000,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.980
they have held the Guinness World Record

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.740
for the strongest
continuous magnetic field.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.500
- Somebody left a chair where
it wasn't supposed to be.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.410
It then got accelerated across the cell,

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.810
completely pulled the
guts out of the chair.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.410
Now we all have those
nice, super uncomfortable,

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.340
wooden chairs.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.010
- For reference, the magnetic field

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.610
of the Earth is 0.00005 Tesla.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.330
A fridge magnet is around 0.01 Tesla.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.540
MRI machines can get up to three Tesla.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.540
But this electromagnet creates
a magnetic field of 45 Tesla,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.603
so nearly a million times
Earth's magnetic field.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.830
To achieve this field, the magnet consists

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.660
of an outer superconducting magnet

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.940
and an inner resistive magnet.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.670
I'll explain why you need
both types in a moment.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.820
The apparatus is two stories tall,

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.140
but the maximum field,

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.720
or field center, only occurs in the center

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.120
of a narrow cylinder that
runs through the middle.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.470
- Right now it's off.
- Is it?

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.550
- [Tim] There's no magnet.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.650
- Can I put my finger in the bore?

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.580
Is that a bad idea?

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.050
- No, it's fine.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.250
You can totally do that.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.473
- I'm gonna see. Oh.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.230
So that's where there's 45 Tesla.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.063
- Further down.

00:01:50.063 --> 00:01:51.720
A meter away from that.
- A meter down.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.430
And so that just drops down

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.470
for a couple meters?
- It's clear all the way

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.970
through to the bottom.
- Oh wow.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.540
- The maximum field is
basically a centimeter tall.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.373
- Yeah.
- Here we have

00:02:01.373 --> 00:02:02.206
very small samples.

00:02:02.206 --> 00:02:05.370
Think something like a chip
in a computer or a cell phone.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.050
That's what users will come in with.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.470
So that's plenty big
for what we want to do

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.870
with material science or
kinetic matter research.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.210
- Since we can't see or film in the center

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.950
of the magnet, we're going to experiment

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.930
with the magnetic field that extends above

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.270
and around the magnet on this platform.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.010
So the magnet's over there?

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.300
- Yes.
- But the magnetic field

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.860
extends all the way out here.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.360
- Yes.
- And past.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.730
This is known as the fringe field,

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.010
and although it's much
weaker than 45 Tesla,

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.650
it is still plenty dangerous.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.720
- For a superconducting magnet,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.420
it depends on the size of that bore.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.120
So the bigger the bore, the
larger the fringe field,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.350
because the magnetic flux does
not penetrate the windings.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.090
And you have to form a complete loop.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.770
So those loops just move further

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.890
and further and further
out to make that field.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.800
So this is the 100 Gauss
line for the fringe field.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.240
- So what happens to objects

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.530
around the 100 Gauss line?

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.770
- Things with shapes will
start orienting themselves

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:02.730
to the field.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.863
So if you have it sitting on a tabletop,

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.200
say over here, it will
start pivoting on its own.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.080
And if you get it too much
closer, it will just go.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.640
And by the time you notice it's moving,

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.630
it's already too late.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.640
Meaning, no ferromagnetic objects

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.840
within the 100 Gauss line.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.660
If you have anything ferromagnetic on you,

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.090
any implants that are metallic.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.500
Pacemaker? Anybody?

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.763
Anybody? Anybody? Okay.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.060
- Ramping up this magnet to full power

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.520
takes around an hour and a half.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.610
That's because they
have to put 47,000 amps

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.700
of current into the outer
superconducting electromagnet.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.620
47,000 amps.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.760
- 47,000 amps, 500 volts.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.950
- It is so insane.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.360
- [Tim] All right, so let's
take it all the way up

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.233
to full field.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.440
- One thing that happens

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.600
in a strong magnetic field, obviously,

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.870
is that magnetic materials
are attracted to it.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.400
We cut open a Nerf football

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.950
and put in a couple steel
washers being careful

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.050
to tape it up so the
washers can't get out.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.940
We also covered the opening to the magnet

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.070
so the ball won't get sucked down into it.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.700
I got an unmodified Nerf football.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.870
And sure enough,

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.993
it's easy to tell which
ball contains the washers.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.670
I tried to throw the football

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.100
and hit the side of the magnet.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.933
Okay.

00:04:20.933 --> 00:04:22.020
After a few misses.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.624
No! Are you kidding me?

00:04:24.624 --> 00:04:25.457
No.
- No.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.220
- It bounced around and stuck.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.880
It should have looked more like this.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.860
Another thing to do if
you have a strong magnet

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.900
is get ferrofluid fluid.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.020
Ferrofluid fluid contains
nanoscale pieces of magnetite,

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.940
that's an iron containing mineral,

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.890
and they're suspended in solution

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.040
coded in surfactants so they
don't all clump together.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.870
But in an external magnetic field,

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.400
they all line up like iron
filings around a bar magnet.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.640
This ferrofluid fluid started
to develop parallel ridges

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.950
even meters away from the magnet.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.250
And as we got closer, spikes
formed on the surface,

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.980
aligning the magnetite
particles with the field.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.160
Closer still and the ferrofluid
fluid climbed up the side

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.360
of the vessel.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.203
- [Tim] So it's not much,
but it's just kind of a.

00:05:11.203 --> 00:05:12.450
- A little bit of a tug?

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.280
- [Tim] Yep, and then
try and tilt it away,

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.530
and then you'll feel the difference.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:17.363
- Oh yeah.

00:05:17.363 --> 00:05:20.310
It definitely preferentially
wants to come this way.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.530
Magnetite is actually the
mineral that led people

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.470
to discover the phenomenon of
magnetism in the first place.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.630
At least 3000 years ago,

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.330
naturally magnetized pieces
of magnetite were found

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.970
in a part of Greece called Magnesia.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.760
That's actually where the
word magnet comes from.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.450
In Greek, they were called
stones from magnesia

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.600
but they were also
referred to as lodestones.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.620
And it was discovered

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.220
that lodestones could attract
each other or pieces of iron.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.890
And by the 11th century
in China, it was realized

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.320
that magnets could be used
to make a compass needle

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.690
that would always point
in the same direction.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.220
The side that pointed to the north

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.250
of the earth was referred
to as a north seeking pole.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.680
And the other side,
the south seeking pole.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.750
Though these days we
often just say North Pole

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.910
and South Pole of the magnet.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.510
But why are only some materials magnetic?

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.330
Electrons are essentially tiny magnets,

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.670
but in most atoms, they are paired up,

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:15.600
one pointing one way

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.040
and the other pointing the opposite way.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.200
So their fields cancel out.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.830
In elements with half full
outer shells of electrons,

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.930
well, then they can't pair up.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.630
So atoms have magnetic fields.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.060
But if neighboring atoms aren't aligned,

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.560
well then, the magnetic fields

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.120
of all the atoms cancel out

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.790
and the bulk material is non-magnetic.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.180
But even if you get all these
atoms aligning in one part

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.190
of the material, known as a domain,

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.160
they may be aligned opposite
atoms in other domains

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.240
and cancel out.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.940
So you need all the domains to be aligned.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.660
Normally when you see these,
they're really strong magnets.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.670
But not here and not yet.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:54.810
And this can be done by applying

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.510
a strong external magnetic field.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.683
So right now, these are not magnetic.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.550
They do not stick to each other.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.800
But he is loading them in there,

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.153
into the Helmholtz coil.

00:07:07.067 --> 00:07:08.357
- See the machine here?
- Whoa!

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.940
And then you get a permanent magnet.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.090
Materials that meet these
criteria are called ferromagnetic.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.700
After iron, the most
common magnetic element.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.240
But nickel and cobalt are
also ferromagnetic magnetic.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.770
In the powerful magnetic field

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.660
around the world's strongest magnet,

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.270
what is even more surprising
to see is the behavior

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.850
of non-ferromagnetic materials.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.790
Here we have four sheets
of different materials.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.090
Two different types of
plastic, copper, and aluminum.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.070
When they are stationary in the field,

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.230
there's no difference between them.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.727
But when they move.

00:07:41.727 --> 00:07:43.920
- Two, one, drop!

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.622
- Materials that conduct
electricity fall a lot slower.

00:07:47.622 --> 00:07:50.872
(gentle upbeat music)

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:53.573
I'll get into that.

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:55.560
But first, this portion of the video

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.880
was sponsored by Google

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.950
and they were interested in this video

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.300
because it's all about magnets,

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.340
which are core to our future.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.840
Electric vehicles, for example,

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.660
use electric motors, which
need magnets to work.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.970
And US search interest
for electric vehicle

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.910
reached an all-time high
in the last 12 months.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.830
That is, according to Google Trends,

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.890
a tool that allows you to see
what people are searching for.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:19.020
The thing that connects
these trending searches

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.930
and many others, is that
people are trying to find ways

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.510
of doing things that are less
destructive to the planet.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.000
And Google is like, "We
live on this planet too.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.530
We also wanna do that."

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.540
In fact, Google has matched 100%

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.110
of their electricity use with
renewable energy since 2017.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:35.580
They also run Project Sunroof,

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.500
which helps people
decide if solar is right

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.870
for their home by
providing Google Maps data

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.820
to create a 3D model of your roof

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.000
and estimate energy
savings from rooftop solar.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.650
Personally, I'm just happy to learn

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.480
that people are searching
for things related

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.480
to sustainability and that
Google has made a real commitment

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.160
to sustainability, too.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.660
You can learn more about sustainability

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.480
and Google's efforts at
sustainability.google.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.240
So thanks to Google for
sponsoring that part of my video.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.403
And now, back to magnets.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.640
What's happening is that,

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.560
as the metal plate is
falling through the field,

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.030
the number of magnetic field lines

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.010
passing through it is changing.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.370
This change in magnetic flux
induces electric currents,

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.170
called eddy currents in the plate,

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.000
which create their own magnetic field

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.550
that opposes the change in the flux.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.770
This is known as Lenz's Law.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.040
So if the plate is falling
towards a north magnetic pole,

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.700
the induced currents create a
north magnetic pole themselves

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.333
so that the plate is repelled
and so it falls much slower.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.000
So as that big plate falls,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.990
there are eddy currents
generated in the metal,

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.390
which should dissipate
some energy as heat.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.400
So I wanna see if we can see that.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.350
- [Tim] It's actually slowing down now.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:50.730
'Cause it's in a much higher field

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:53.400
- Now it is slight,
but I think you can see

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.583
that the plate is warming
up a bit as it falls.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.910
Previously, I visited an
electromagnetic levitator

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.550
at the Palace of Discovery in Paris.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.540
Whoa!

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.660
It uses an alternating
current to levitate a plate,

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.130
but the eddy currents in that plate

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.070
generate so much heat
that water actually boils

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.150
on its surface.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.750
Check out how hot this plate is.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.080
I like to think of Lenz's
Law as the "No You Don't" Law

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.050
because whatever you try to
do, nature acts to oppose you.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.150
- There you go.
- Ah!

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.680
If the plate is falling,

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.720
eddy currents are induced
to slow its dissent.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.063
Look at it! (laughs)

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:36.763
But if you try to pick up the plate.

00:10:36.763 --> 00:10:37.596
(laughs) Come on!

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.297
Nature also says, "No, you don't."

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.540
In this case, a south
magnetic pole is induced

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.150
under the plate, attracting
it back to the magnet.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.950
They don't know if I'm weak

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:53.690
or if this is actually insanely difficult.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.880
Ah, ah.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.280
Oh.
- There you go.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.184
- Oh my goodness.
- You're strong like bull.

00:11:02.184 --> 00:11:03.060
- Whoa.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.300
No matter how hard I tried
to push the plate down,

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.340
it just wouldn't go very fast.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.500
Because even if I could
speed it up a little bit,

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.540
that would increase the
rate of change of flux,

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.310
and hence the induced currents

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.383
and their associated magnetic field.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:18.573
That is ridiculous.

00:11:20.417 --> 00:11:21.990
It's so weird.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.030
We tried a number of other conductive,

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.340
but non-magnetic objects,
around the magnet,

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.710
like this thick cylinder of aluminum.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.687
Drop it straight on the
magnet and nature says,

00:11:31.687 --> 00:11:33.420
"No you don't."

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.390
Try to roll it across
the top. No you don't.

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:37.923
It just refuses to roll.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.260
We wrapped up a volleyball
in aluminum foil

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.003
and passed it across the magnet.

00:11:49.579 --> 00:11:51.663
Or dropped it straight in.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.400
Again, the changing magnetic
flux induces eddy currents

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.440
that produce their own magnetic field

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.800
to oppose the original change in flux.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.010
We wanted to see just how much
deceleration the fringe field

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.110
of the 45 Tesla magnet could achieve.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.420
So we decided to fire projectiles

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.300
from a potato cannon across the top.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.123
- You ready?
- All right, we're ready.

00:12:15.123 --> 00:12:20.123
- Three, two, one.
(metal clanks)

00:12:20.972 --> 00:12:25.560
Heads!
(metal clanks)

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.210
- This is what the projectile looked like

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:29.610
with the magnetic field off.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:33.393
And this is what it looked like
with the magnetic field on.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.930
If we compare the two shots, you can see

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.690
that as the projectile
enters the magnetic field,

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.990
the induced eddy currents
rotate the projectile.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:47.010
So it remains oriented along
the magnetic field lines.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.410
And this minimizes the change in flux

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:50.880
that's experienced by the projectile.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.310
- [Operator] Three, two, one.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.730
- Now, some of the
projectiles contained coils

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.290
of wire that were connected to LEDs.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:02.670
- So the LEDs are actually
biased opposite polarity.

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.770
So no matter which direction
the field is coming in,

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.330
one of them will be lit.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.250
And we're hoping that as
it crosses through a field,

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.200
you'll see the change in color of LED

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.033
of the nose cone.

00:13:11.033 --> 00:13:14.070
- Mar And sure enough,
these projectiles light up,

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:16.983
showing how the induced currents
are changing in the coil.

00:13:17.902 --> 00:13:20.820
(gentle music)

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.080
You know, in all these cases

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.360
the induced electric energy is dissipated,

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.520
either as light or heat.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.670
But what if you had a material
that didn't dissipate energy,

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:33.240
like a superconductor below
its critical temperature?

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.250
There are two important things to know

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.070
about the high temperature
superconductor we're using here.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.230
First, below its critical temperature,

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:43.320
most of the material has
zero electrical resistance,

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.020
which means, if you bring
a magnet close to it,

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.440
currents will be induced to
oppose the change in flux.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.940
And since it's a superconductor,

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.280
those currents can persist indefinitely

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.310
and expel all of the magnetic field.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.980
Second, there are some
filaments through the material

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.870
that are not superconducting.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.420
- There's defects that are engineered

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:04.440
into the superconductors,

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.160
a second phase that traps
those magnetic field lines

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.750
and keeps them from moving.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.720
It can no longer rise or fall

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.173
because it's kind of locked in
that magnetic configuration.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:19.590
- This is the human levitator.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:22.800
It consists of a 90 pound,
or 40 kilogram, magnet,

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.680
hovering above a ring of superconductors.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.210
So I'm standing at the magnet,

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:28.560
and underneath is the superconductor?

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.393
- That's right.

00:14:29.393 --> 00:14:30.810
- When I stand on the magnet,

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:34.050
it is pressed down into
the superconductors.

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:37.650
But the increase in magnetic
flux is opposed by currents

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:40.200
in the superconductors
creating a magnetic field

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.330
that repels the magnetic field

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.980
from the magnet I'm standing on.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.480
Maintain my angular moment.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.383
Oh yeah.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.323
So I remain levitating
above the superconductors.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:55.110
- [Speaker] I also brought a leaf blower,

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:56.988
if you wanna hold on that, turn it on.

00:14:56.988 --> 00:14:59.472
- For real?
(group laughs)

00:14:59.472 --> 00:15:01.132
- It's up to you.
- Let's get it.

00:15:01.132 --> 00:15:04.132
(leaf blower whirs)

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.790
Now, there's another way to
levitate in a magnetic field

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:18.270
that has nothing to do
with induced eddy currents.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:19.860
And it's all because

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.830
all materials actually
have magnetic properties.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:24.180
They're just hard to see

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.060
unless a strong magnetic field is present.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.720
Some materials are always
attracted to magnetic fields.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.420
They display what's called para magnetism.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.860
Oxygen is like this.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.833
- We have liquid oxygen
dripping off the bottom here,

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.150
and it gets attracted to the magnet.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.360
It doesn't matter if it's a north

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.800
or south magnetic pole,

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.550
the presence of the external
field causes the magnetic field

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.860
of material to strengthen
the overall magnetic field.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.860
And that causes attraction.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.950
Other materials, in fact,
most materials are repelled

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:59.070
by a strong enough magnetic
field, either north or south.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:01.860
And this is known as diamagnetism.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.870
Water is a good example of this.

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:05.550
In the presence of the external field,

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:08.850
the water molecules become
opposing magnets effectively.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:11.370
And so they are repelled.

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.950
So here you can see how
bringing a magnet close

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:16.950
to the surface of water creates an indent.

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.600
You can use this repulsion

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.250
in a strong enough magnetic field

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.980
to levitate objects you
ordinarily wouldn't think

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.630
of as magnetic.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:28.350
Here we're using a slightly
weaker 31 Tesla magnet

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:30.570
so that we can use a periscope setup

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.400
to actually see into the bore.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.136
And our camera is there.
- So as soon as you are

00:16:34.136 --> 00:16:35.820
on this optical way,

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.220
you should be able to put everything down.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.060
- Wonderful.

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:43.200
This strawberry will be magnetic
in a strong enough field.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.910
- Well, it's diamagnetic right now.

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.680
It's just we're not in
a strong enough field.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.513
- Right.
- Yeah.

00:16:47.513 --> 00:16:49.320
- For us to see anything.
- Mm hmm. Correct.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.340
Because of the water.
- Right.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.237
- Water is diamagnetic

00:16:51.237 --> 00:16:53.387
and there's a lot of
water in strawberries.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.660
- Oh, that's nice.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.640
Oh, that's beautiful.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.470
Yeah, it's beautiful.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:03.870
And the same occurs with a raspberry

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.423
or a little piece of plastic pizza.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.390
Living organisms contain enough water

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.460
that they too can be levitated.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.470
They wouldn't do it here at the mag lab

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.918
but people have levitated frogs.

00:17:15.918 --> 00:17:17.602
- Oh!
- Yep, this is it!

00:17:17.602 --> 00:17:20.640
Yep, there you go.
- No way!

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.563
- And grasshoppers?

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.190
Even mice in experiments meant

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.020
to help understand the
effects of weightlessness

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.240
without having to go into space.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.510
So are very strong magnetic
fields safe for living things?

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:34.800
- There are no lasting effects,

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.030
there are no long-term effects.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:39.030
But we have noticed that
there is the possibility

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.600
of actually polarizing the
stones that are in the inner ear.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.330
And the effect that that has on the rodent

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.673
is that the rodent actually spins.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.940
- Like they go in circles?
- They go in circles.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.140
It doesn't last for very long.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.450
It's only a few minutes
after the animal comes out

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:55.283
of the magnet.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.020
- So how do you actually make

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.300
the world's strongest magnet?

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.860
Contrary to what I expected,

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:05.280
you can't do it just with
superconducting magnets alone.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.565
- The highest magnetic
field you could generate

00:18:07.565 --> 00:18:11.220
with superconducting wire
was nominally 20 Tesla.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.560
- That's because
superconductors have a limit

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.050
to the amount of magnetic
field they can withstand

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.600
before they're no longer superconducting.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.120
So the solution is to combine an outer

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.010
superconducting electromagnet

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:26.610
with an inner electromagnet
made of ordinary wire.

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:30.210
- So the blue, green,
and salmon colored bits,

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.070
that's the superconducting outsert.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.890
That produces 11.5 Tesla.

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:37.950
Inside of that, we put a resistive magnet

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.720
that produces 33 and a half Tesla.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.620
Maxwell's equations, fields
add, we get 45 Tesla.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.450
- But making high field magnets

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:48.870
with ordinary resistive
wire is really hard

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:52.380
- For a wire wound magnet,
like a junkyard magnet,

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.210
a traditional electromagnet,

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:57.810
the highest magnetic field you
can get is about two Tesla.

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:01.530
And the reason is that
you cannot get the heat

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.000
out of the innermost windings.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.450
So back in the 1950s,
Francis Bitter, up at MIT,

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.540
he realized that physics doesn't care

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.070
what shape the conductor is.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:12.780
You can take your round wire

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.970
and smash it into a very thin plate.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:19.970
If you then stack those plates
with alternating insulators,

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:24.660
you make a helix, that
electrically looks just like that.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.320
But now I can push cooling water axially

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.060
through the stack of conductor.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.040
So that means that innermost part,

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.750
I can now pull all that heat away,

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.670
which means I can go to
much, much, much, much,

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:39.060
much higher currents through these coils

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:42.360
up to 57,000 amps than what you can do

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.430
with a traditional wire
round electromagnet.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.590
- And that gives you 34 Tesla, that?

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:49.500
- That gives you 33.5,
but it's stacked up.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.350
So we stack all of these
up in a stacking jig.

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:54.330
They're aligned up with tie rods.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.610
We then put about 20 tons of force on it

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.440
and then lock those tie rods down

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.180
and that holds the coil together

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.630
and it gives us our electrical
connection between each turn.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:05.250
And we're pushing, you know,

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:06.900
several thousand gallons per minute

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.380
of deionized water through
those coils to keep them cold

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.228
'cause otherwise it melts and you're done.

00:20:13.228 --> 00:20:16.170
Occasionally you get material failure

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:19.920
that happens when the material
goes past its plastic limit

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.610
and starts flexing either
into the coil next to it

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:25.380
or maybe even shorting to ground.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.390
And this is what happened here.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:29.160
The coil plastically failed,

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.400
meaning the metal went beyond
its springy characteristics,

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.570
where it would come back,

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:35.370
and it just completely deformed,

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.593
which drove it into the coil next to it,

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.910
burned through the insulator,

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:45.030
and then vaporized all of this metal.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.060
And you can see more on the inside.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.790
It killed this coil, which is the B coil.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:53.100
But because it failed on the inner edge,

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.180
it killed the A coil.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.352
Failed on the outer edge,
it also killed the C coil.

00:20:57.352 --> 00:20:59.880
So that was an expensive failure.

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.630
- Expensive failure.
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.670
The record is the highest
continuous magnetic field

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:06.390
in the world, period.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:09.413
China recently commissioned
their 45 Tesla hybrid,

00:21:09.413 --> 00:21:11.850
very similar in concept to ours.

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:13.860
So now there's two of them in the world.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.020
- Running the strongest
magnets on the planet

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.180
takes a lot of energy.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.700
The Mag Lab uses a significant fraction

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.500
of Tallahassee's electricity.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.070
- So we can consume with
all four power supplies

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:29.970
at full blast about 8% of their
total generating capacity.

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:32.670
- What's the electricity
budget of this place?

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:36.390
- So nominal $250 to $300,000 a month.

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.280
- Holy, yeah, that's a lot.
- Yeah.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.790
So we operate in their
federally mandated reserve,

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.830
which every utility has to have.

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:45.090
They have to have that available

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:47.100
to push into the grid
if there's a problem.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.260
We have a deal set up with the city

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.560
so that they can actually
make money off that power

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.080
that they have to produce,
but which they can't sell.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.870
The flip side is, when
they need it, we ramp down,

00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:59.340
and we can go down much faster

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.110
than they can spin up a Genny.

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:03.090
- Why do you need 45 Tesla?

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:05.850
- There are a couple things
that drive material discovery.

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:08.280
One of them is just
growing a new material.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:12.060
The other one is putting it
in an extreme environment,

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.440
like high magnetic field,

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.570
high electric field, high pressure,

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:17.310
ultra low temperature.
- Low temperature.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:20.970
- Another axis is taking
an existing material

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.790
and improving its cleanliness.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:25.890
So getting all the impurities out.

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:29.190
So as you drop the
impurities in the material,

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:33.090
you're reducing where the
electrons scatter from in there.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:35.250
And that improves the properties,

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:37.290
enables you to see things
that you were never able

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:38.220
to see before.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.610
We've only just barely
scratched the surface

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.110
on what can be done with this.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:46.050
People are gonna look back
about 25 years from now

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:48.210
and this will be the inflection point,

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:49.310
this five year period.
