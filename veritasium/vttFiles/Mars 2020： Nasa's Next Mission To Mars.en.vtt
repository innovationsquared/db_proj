00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.860
This is such an awesome experience

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.140
To get up close and personal with the curiosity rover

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.200
I mean, this isn't the exact one that's on Mars, obviously

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.280
but it's basically identical

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.520
VOICEOVER: I'm here at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.120
I don't know how we got in here, Bill. It's amazing.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.940
VOICEOVER: This is the NASA center that's famous for building things like the Mars rover,

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.500
space probes, and rescuing Matt Damon from the red planet

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.660
DEREK: You guys must get pretty sick of answering questions about The Martian

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.540
KEN: Yes.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.420
VOICEOVER: This is project scientist Ken Farley

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.700
I spoke with him about life on Mars.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.810
He's one of many scientists working 
on the first NASA mission in 40 years

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.020
designed specifically to look for life on another planet.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.980
It's called, Mars 2020.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.420
DEREK: If there were life on Mars, wouldn't we have found it by now?

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.300
KEN: No. We would not have found it by now.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.560
DEREK: But we've been looking! There's been a number of missions like

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.860
the Viking landers and like Curiosity, for example

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.580
DEREK: Part of the problem is, we're not even sure what we're looking for.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.980
Life on Mars may have been completely
different from life on Earth

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.580
Recent missions, like the Curiosity and Exploration rovers, look for and found evidence of water,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.580
a key ingredient for life.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.420
SARAH: Follow the water, where was the water and when was the water

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.620
and then looking for habitability, looking for places that could have supported life.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.820
Now we know enough about Mars
to look for ancient life

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.740
instead of anything on the surface of Mars today.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.740
DEREK: There's no life on the surface of Mars today?

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.060
SARAH: Most likely, if there is life on Mars today, it would be underground, underneath the ice caps,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.920
in places that are very very hard to investigate with the sort of rovers and landers that we've sent so far

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.520
DEREK: So we're talking, like, moles, groundhogs [LAUGHTER]

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.280
SARAH: Well, microscopic, bacterial moles. No, not actual moles!

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.780
We're looking for, we call them biosignatures.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.120
It's a pattern or a substance in the rocks that can only have been formed by life.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.920
VOICEOVER: To find those biosignatures, the 2020 rover is gonna need cutting edge technologies,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.920
developed here at JPL.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.800
But for definitive proof of life, they'll need drill samples.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.280
KEN: We need to take a core, that's about the size of a piece of chalk.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.360
We have to collect 37 tubes like this that will ultimately be laid on the surface of Mars

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.040
for possible return in the future.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.940
VOICEOVER: Mars 2020 is different from past missions

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.880
because now NASA will need to bring those samples back to Earth to test them for evidence of life.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.620
KEN: If they are brought back to Earth, we will be able to use all sorts of different kinds of techniques,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.680
many of which have not yet even been invented

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.800
because nobody has been posed with this question.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.800
VOICEOVER: So, in order to find life, we'll have to return those samples from Mars,

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.880
something that's never been done before,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.940
then test those samples with techniques that haven't even been invented yet.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.440
So I had to ask:

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.940
DEREK: How good do you think your chances are, of finding life?

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.480
KEN: Hmmm

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.600
I'd say they're poorer than even just because I remain skeptical

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.880
Regardless, we will learn about what the early history of the Solar System is like.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.100
And that's the same environment, the same Solar System, that earth was in when life was evolving.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.600
If you want to understand the origin of life, on Earth 'cause that's the only place we know life exists,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.400
the rocks that recorded that are all gone.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.960
DEREK: So in a way, looking at Mars is like looking at a version of Earth frozen in time

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.960
right about when life would've sprung?

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.800
KEN: That's, I think, the most exciting way to look at it.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.400
It's just unbelievable. The stuff that is happening here is just so far beyond anything else.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.160
What are you doing today?

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.460
Are you sitting in your cubicle, are you working on your computer?

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:46.740
Ok, these guys are working on a freaking machine, in outer space, on Mars that is trying to discover life.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.360
This is cool.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.120
That was one of my field pieces from the Netflix show "Bill Nye Saves the World".

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.080
on which I am a correspondent.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.100
If you haven't seen it, you should check it out.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.180
But, obviously, because that show is for a broader audience, I don't get to go into the kinda crazy detail

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.100
that I sometimes do on this channel.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.040
For example, this image is the first ever beamed back from the Martian surface.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.300
It was taken by the Soviet lander, Mars 3 on
December 2, 1971.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.300
After becoming the first man-made object to make a soft landing on Mars

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:26.280
that lander transmitted data back to earth for just 14.5 seconds before going quiet.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.660
And no one really knows what happened to it

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.800
but it might have had something to do with the huge dust storm that was taking place at the time.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.300
Now, this is the first clear image sent back from the Martian surface.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.560
It was taken by the Viking One Lander on
July 20th 1976.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:47.060
And one of the stated aims for that mission, was to try to find evidence of existing life on the Martian surface.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.080
And there was this experiment 
called the labeled release experiment

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.060
where a scoop of Martian soil was taken

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.900
and then a dilute solution of nutrients was
added into that soil

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.220
but, in those nutrients was the radioactive atom

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.140
Carbon-14, the idea was if you tried

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.980
to detect the gases around the soil

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.660
if you detect some radioactive Carbon Dioxide

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.159
you know that the nutrients were

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.860
broken down by something in the soil

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.140
presumably something that's living.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.920
what was remarkable about this experiment was

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.160
that it got a positive result, there were a few other experiments trying to detect life in other ways

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.380
and they failed to get a detection, but this one
detected radioactive Carbon Dioxide

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.400
and what's even more impressive was the
Viking 2 Lander

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.320
which tried the same experiments

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.490
after the Viking 1 Lander, it also got

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.000
the same positive result, so things were

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.380
looking promising, but then about a week

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.640
later they tried to rerun the experiment

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.860
add a little bit more nutrients to the

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.220
soil and see if you could get more CO₂, but they couldn't

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:52.320
there was no additional CO₂ released, so based 
on these negative results and the negative

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.660
results of the other experiments.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:00.500
Most scientists have concluded that there is no surviving life on the surface of Mars, today.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.040
so how is the CO₂ produced in the first place?

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.800
Well, chemists suspect that very highly oxidizing chemicals, things like perchlorates, exist in the Martian

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.120
soil and would have reacted with 
the nutrients producing the CO₂ to start with.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.480
But, once those chemicals are used up, well there's nothing for those

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.520
nutrients to react with, and so we get no

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.440
CO₂ the next time, the nutrients are introduced.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.860
this story highlights just how difficult searching
for life is using only remote instruments.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.120
And that's why, for Mars 2020 they're going to

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.120
create some rock samples that should be

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.260
returned to earth, if only they can get

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.620
the budget for another mission that will go 
back and pick them up.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.080
But the rover they're sending in 2020, will 
also have some new tools on board

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.660
that will allow them to look at rocks in

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.960
finer detail than ever before.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.580
One tool called PIXL, will use x-ray spectrometry to try to

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.040
detect chemical elements with a spatial resolution that

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.940
goes down to the size of a grain of salt.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:59.760
Now what they be looking for, are layered structures similar to stromatolite found here on earth.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.360
those are mineral deposits which get
built up by billions and billions of-

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:11.620
tiny organisms. - So you are not really looking for
fossils or tiny little you know, microbial evidence.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.180
We are looking for the structures that they
would have produced, layered structures.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.560
that's how we know about the oldest life
on Earth, and so it's logical to think

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.600
that's how we might find out about this old life on Mars.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.960
And the job of finding evidence of past
or current life on Mars

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.460
is made even more difficult by Planetary Protection,

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.160
that's the principle whereby we
should not introduce any life from

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.760
Earth to these places where we're studying like Mars.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.700
and that's completely understandable, because I mean the worst discovery of life we could make on Mars

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.440
would be life that we introduced there

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.200
by our spacecraft...

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.360
I mean certain organisms are really hardy,

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.480
even in the vacuum of space and even when
bombarded by radiation.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.440
But, due to this constraint, spacecraft must be strenuously

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.640
sterilized and also, they're restricted from landing near sites where we think

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.920
there may be liquid water.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.000
I'm really looking forward to the results of
the Mars 2020 mission.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.960
and hopefully a later mission, where we actually go back and collect the samples that were placed there.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.100
But one thing that really struck me from my interview with Kim Farley was

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.980
when he said that Mars is really like a

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.320
time capsule of the rocks that Earth had

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.240
when life evolved here.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.940
That's, a way I'd never really thought about it before,

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.640
but of course because of plate tectonics and

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.040
all the weathering that would have taken place on earth,

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.080
we don't have the rock record from when
life was first evolving on

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.780
this planet, and that makes Mars

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:34.300
a really good place to look, not only for new
forms of life, but also for an

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.720
understanding of how life on Earth, may have begun.
