00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
How long does it take for the Earth to go around the sun?

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.380
Well, a day.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.860
"Well--" Yeah? "Twenty-four hours." Twenty four hours?

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.820
What do you reckon, cuz?

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.680
Isn't it twenty four hours?

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.740
Obviously a day, yes.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.860
A day, I hope.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.740
I know it takes, uh, ninety minutes for the space station to go around the earth

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.340
Three-hundred and sixty days.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.540
No, one day. Is it one day?

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.640
I don't know. What is it?

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.500
I say one year.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.400
I dunno, like a year.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.020
Uh, a year.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.100
One year.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.020
Twelve months.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.160
Twelve months?

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.940
Three-hundred and sixty five

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.080
Three-hundred and sixty-five

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.180
Three-hundred and sixty-five

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.380
Three-hundred and sixty-five

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.960
Three-hundred and sixty five days?

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.340
Yeah, I'd agree with that

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.840
Three-sixty five.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.660
It's somewhere between that, it's not quite precise, is it?

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.160
Three-hundred and sixty-five and a bit days.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.600
It's nearly three hundred and--it's three hundred and sixty five

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.120
Five and a quarter days.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.540
Wait, the earth doesn't take one day to get around the sun.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.580
Takes about a year.
