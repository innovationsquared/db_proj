00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.660
In science, we often have to deal with some
very large numbers. For example, the mass

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:20.680
of the sun.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:29.780
That is the mass of the sun. Two followed
by thirty zeros in units of kilograms. That

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:39.600
is two thousand billion billion billion kilograms.
There has got to be a better way to write

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.629
that. Can you imagine if there wasn't? And
so we find that the mass of the sun is two

00:00:47.629 --> 00:01:00.609
zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero.
Yes? Sorry could you repeat that? I was with

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:17.820
you up to two zero zero zero zero zero? Ahh?
It was ahh... two zero zero. So to represent

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:25.630
large numbers easily, we use something called
scientific notation. Scientific notation takes

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:36.920
advantage of powers of ten. For example, ten
to the power of two means take two tens and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:46.039
multiply them together. And you get 100. Ten
to the power of three means multiply three

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:58.159
tens together. And you get 1000. Ten to the
power of four means take four tens and multiply

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:06.899
them together. And you get 10,000. So you
should notice a pattern developing. When it's

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.470
ten to the power of two, our final answer
has a one followed by two zeros. Ten to the

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.610
power of three, our final answer has a one
followed by three zeros. Ten to the power

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.670
of four, again, four zeros. So if we wanted
to represent the mass of the sun in scientific

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.080
notation, we would need thirty zeros. So we
represent that using ten to the power of thirty.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.250
This means that we're multiplying ten by itself
thirty times, which gives us a one followed

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:43.030
by thirty zeros. But the mass of the sun is
actually twice that. It's two followed by

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.500
thirty zeros so we can multiply two by ten
to the thirty in units of kilograms and that

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.560
is the mass of the sun. It's much easier to
write and it takes up much less space on the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:03.840
page. The other problem is we have to deal
with some tiny numbers. For example the mass

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:18.440
of a proton is...
That is the mass of a proton. Zero point,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:26.800
and there there are 26 zeros, and then 1673
kilograms. A truly tiny number so how do we

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.130
deal with this? Well again it's using a similar
trick. If we raise ten to the power of minus

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:40.410
one, it means divide by ten, not multiply
by ten. So this means divide by ten which

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:48.830
gives you zero point one. Ten to the power
of minus two means divide by ten twice, which

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.530
gives us zero point zero one, a hundredth.
Ten to the power of minus three means divide

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:04.980
by ten three times, or zero point zero zero
one. So again you see a pattern developing.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:12.110
The exponent here tells you how many places
to the right of the decimal that the one is.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:19.100
So in this case, ten to the minus two, the
one is two places to the right of the decimal.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.510
Here, ten to the minus three, the one is three
places to the right of the decimal. So in

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.690
this case I actually have a one that is 27
places to the right of the decimal. So I can

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:43.840
write the mass of a proton as 1.673 times
ten to the minus 27 kilograms. And this ten

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:52.310
to the minus 27 has the function of putting
this number, 1.673, 27 decimal places to the

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:59.350
right of the decimal point. So as a challenge
question to see if you've understood it: if

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:05.340
the sun were made entirely of protons, how
many protons would there be in the sun?
