00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Gravity

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
is working with me

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And Gravity,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
keeps me on the ground

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
All mass attracts

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
all other mass

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
a force proportional

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
to mass one and two

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and inversely to

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
the distance between them squared

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Oh, gravity

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
is working with me

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and gravity,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
makes apples fall to ground

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Oh twice the mass

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
has twice the pull

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
but the force on each

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
is still equal

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It keeps the moon

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and the satellites

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
going round

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Oh twice the mass

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
has twice the pull

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but the force on each

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
is still equal

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
It keeps the moon

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and the satellites

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
going round

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Oh gravity,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
the force that makes weight on me

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Woah, gravity,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
now general relativity

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
(how can that be?)

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
The force between us all is

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
The force between us all is

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
The force between us all is

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Gravity between us all is

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Gravity between us all is

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Gravity between gravity between us all is
