00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.740
&gt;&gt; DEREK: How did Celsius define his scale?

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.940
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL: Uh... He took the temperature water freezes at and said that's zero and then he took the

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.730
temperature it boils at and says that's a
hundred. And he figured a hundred

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.539
was a good amount of demarcations to make in between the two.  Right?

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.500
&gt;&gt; DEREK: Yeah. Except that's not what he did.
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL: Really?

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.140
&gt;&gt; DEREK: Celsius never devised nor used the scale that now bears his name.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.140
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL: Are you kidding me?  
&gt;&gt; DEREK: No, Michael, I'm not!

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.820
This is the Swedish town of Uppsala,
located 70 kilometers north of Stockholm.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.460
So this is the house where Celsius lived.
In 1741 he was professor of astronomy at

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.030
Uppsala University. And this is the
first ever Celsius thermometer... or is it?

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:54.570
&gt;&gt; This is the first scale of Anders Celsius
added onto... or, added onto an old

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.590
thermometer.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.250
So we have Delisle' scale on the left
hand side and Celsius' new scale in the right.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.280
&gt;&gt; DEREK: These few markings show that Celsius came up with

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.080
the idea of separating the freezing and
boiling points of water by 100 degrees.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.930
He made his first observations with the
scale on Christmas Day 1741. But have you

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.600
noticed something strange about this scale?

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.250
I mean, 50 is marked in the middle but
the numbers increase down towards the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.450
bulb of the thermometer. So, Celsius had
his scale upside down.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.770
He set zero degrees at the boiling
point of water and a hundred at the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.939
freezing point.

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.270
Why would he do this? Well, for one thing

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.240
Celsius was just following the
convention of the other scale on the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.600
thermometer. Delisle' scale also had
zero degrees for the boiling point of

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.340
water increasing down to 150 for his
freezing point. And a likely reason both

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.600
of them used upside down scales is
because they avoid negative numbers.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.070
In Sweden it gets much colder than freezing
but never warmer than boiling water so

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.909
you don't have to worry about pesky
minus signs and this helps avoid logbook

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:00.780
errors.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.960
I think it would be really weird if you
had water boiling

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.920
zero degrees and freezing at a hundred.
Wouldn't that be strange?

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.780
Although it might seem strange today,
there is no objectively good reason for

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.100
preferring an ascending scale over a
descending one for measuring degrees of

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.440
something, like hot or cold.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.180
In fact, when Celsius died of
tuberculosis in 1744, he was still using

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.040
this inverted scale.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.700
So who reversed it? Who do we have to
thank for the modern Celsius temperature scale?

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.350
Well in 1745, just a year after Celsius'
death

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.310
a new column appears in the Uppsala
temperature record using the modern

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.120
scale and at the top it's got the
heading "Ekström"  Now Ekström was the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.489
instrument maker at Uppsala.  In 1747
another column is added with the heading

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.120
Strömer who was Celsius' successor
as professor of astronomy.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.610
Again, it's got the same modern scale.  But it's another professor at Uppsala who

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.739
claims that he reversed the scale:

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.780
That's the famous biologist Carl
Linnaeus. He says he reversed the scale

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.030
when he ordered a thermometer from
Ekström for his greenhouse.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.410
Whoever it was, we know that by 1745
there was an operational thermometer at

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.390
Uppsala University with a scale that we
now all know as the Celsius temperature scale.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:22.290
Except... this was not the first such
thermometer ever created.  In 1743 the

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.310
year before Celsius died, a French
scientist working independently in Lyon

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.850
created a thermometer with zero degrees
at the freezing point of water and a

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.739
hundred at the boiling point.

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:38.130
his name was Jeane Pierre Christin. 
So why isn't it called a degree Christin instead

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.870
of a degrees Celsius?

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.760
Well, for a long time this temperature
scale wasn't referred to using either of

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.450
their names and instead it was just
called the "centigrade scale," meaning a

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.620
hundred steps.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.489
The problem with this was "centigrade"
has other meanings in French, Spanish and

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.959
Italian, where a grade specifically
refers to one one-hundredth of a right

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.040
angle. So to eliminate this confusion the
International Bureau of Weights and

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.870
Measures in 1948 decided to rename the
centigrade scale after a scientist

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.140
bringing it into alignment with other
temperature scales like Kelvin

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.450
and Fahrenheit. They chose Celsius
possibly due to a popular 1800's German

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.109
chemistry textbook by a guy named Berzelius. In it, Berzelius identified

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.130
Celsius as the first to devise a
temperature scale with zero at water's

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.580
freezing point and a hundred at its
boiling point propagating the myth that

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.740
Celsius created this scale. So is Celsius
undeserving of having his name

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.110
immortalized on weather maps around the world?

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.000
Well, no. I mean making two marks and
deciding on a number of degrees in

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.410
between them that is the easy part which
others could, and as history shows, did do...

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.760
but what Celsius did was he established
which physical processes could reliably

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.260
produce a fixed temperature. At the time
when he was working, there were some 30

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.970
different temperature scales in use. Some
thermometers had 18 different scales on

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.830
them, some more reliable than others. For
fixed reference points one scale used the

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.350
deepest cellar of the Paris observatory,

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.669
others used the melting temperature of
butter, the internal temperatures of

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:14.400
certain animals, or the hottest day in
summer in Italy, Syria or Senegal. These

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.790
dubious scales combined, with
inconsistent thermometer construction

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.229
made recording accurate temperatures
nearly impossible, not to mention sharing

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:26.640
those temperatures with other scientists
elsewhere. Celsius solved this problem in

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.340
a number of ways: he demonstrated that
melting snow maintains a fixed temperature

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.910
regardless of latitude or ambient
pressure. He also determined the precise

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.419
relationship between boiling point of
water and the ambient pressure, so that

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.030
thermometers could be calibrated under
any conditions.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.320
He made it possible to establish a
universal reliable system of temperature

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.700
measurement and this is why Celsius' name is a unit of temperature, even

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:56.010
though the scale itself was not created
by him and in fact today the Celsius

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:01.080
scale is no longer defined by either of
water's phase transition points, instead

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.010
it is based off the Kelvin scale and
that scale is defined by setting the

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.120
triple point of water,

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:12.210
where solid, liquid, and gas all exist in
equilibrium at exactly 273.16 Kelvin.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.740
This fixes the size of a degree Kelvin,
which is exactly the same as the size of

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.950
a degree Celsius. The zero point of the
Celsius scale is set a 273.15 Kelvin.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.270
And what all this means
is that today pure water boils at

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.410
99.974 degrees Celsius and freezes at negative

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:36.860
0.0001 Celsius. This precision in a
nearly universal system of temperature

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.160
measurement is thanks to a huge number
of scientists

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.200
so the C after the degree symbol
stands not only for Celsius or Christin

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:51.050
or Carl Linnaeus, but for the community
of scientists whose work over centuries

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.050
made a scale so robust that we take it
for granted.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.220
[sound effects]

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.220
Hey! I hope you enjoyed that
video. I just wanted to talk to you for a

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.060
second about Patreon. Now, as you probably know, Patreon is a website where you can

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.080
support creators that you like by
pledging a small dollar amount per month

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.460
or per video. Now, I have had a Patreon
page for a very long time but I have

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.210
never promoted it and I have never
accepted any pledges on that page.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.870
The reason is because I felt I could
never really offer value through the

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.160
site because I was too disorganized and
I was traveling too much, but despite

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.020
that 750 of you have pledged 
nearly $2000 a video and for that I

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.040
am incredibly grateful and I want to
announce that starting next video I will

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:39.590
be accepting pledges through Patreon.
And in return I will be offering some unique

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:44.450
rewards to those patrons and I will also
redouble my efforts to make this YouTube

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.660
channel bigger and better than it's ever
been before.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.660
So if you want to support Veritasium
directly, you can now do that

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:55.880
via Patreon and if you don't want to or you
can't that is totally fine too. Frankly, I

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.570
am just very appreciative that anyone
likes watching these videos at all.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.440
So now I'm going to go get to work on
making this YouTube channel as good as

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.980
it possibly can be and I really want to
thank you for all your support over the

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.080
years and I want to thank you for
watching!
