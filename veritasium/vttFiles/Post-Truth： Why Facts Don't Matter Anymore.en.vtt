00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
This is the challenge of a YouTuber,

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.940
which is, you know, pushing the record button and actually filming something.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.040
Because you never know: "Are people going to hate it?"

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.100
Or "Is it good enough?"

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.280
Have you thought through what you're going to say.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.780
I've not thought through what I'm going to say...

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.180
(Laughter)

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.240
Ok, so I wanted to talk about the question:

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.500
Why is it that right now, when it is really easy to get access to facts, and information

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.500
Where you could just pull up your phone and look up anything in the world...

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.880
Why is it now that we have the most access to facts, do facts mean the least?

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.320
Why does fake news spread now. Why are we more

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.690
polarized now than ever before and what

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.120
I have to kind of admit to you is that I

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.870
was a real optimist.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.940
Maybe I was naive about the internet, but

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.820
my thinking about having an

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.859
international communication system

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.840
whereby anyone anywhere can share

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.539
anything and anyone anywhere regardless

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.390
of say their education background or

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.670
their class standing can get access to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.740
real information through wikipedia ok

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.930
my thinking was the internet was going

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.409
to make everyone happier and more

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.280
informed more educated I and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.590
probably more tolerant of others around

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.770
them, and the reason why I think that the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.240
internet should make people more tolerant

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.479
is because it should expose people to

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.320
people who are not like them. Right?

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.880
I mean is this is crazy!

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.909
My thinking is that as we have a

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.590
platform to communicate with each other

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.360
people in diverse places people with

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.060
different interest from us and we all

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.280
have the ability to sort of debate and

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.439
agree upon what is true we all would

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.180
become more accepting of the facts.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.520
Maybe I'm ranting on about this too much.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.770
Is too much?

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:07.020
Ok, so we can edit we can edit (the video) so I guess

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.590
the point is in summary,

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.140
I thought that the internet would

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.690
make the world more connected more

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.860
tolerant more educated and more true

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.379
like more agreed upon the facts and the

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.099
way things are. And for a while I think

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.170
there were signs that this was happening.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.580
There was the Arab Spring where you know

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.230
people in countries that had been kind

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.459
of dictatorship for people who've been

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.810
oppressed for rising up there was the

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.610
approval of gay marriage in a number of

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.190
countries there were agreed upon climate

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.319
agreements that seem to suggest the

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.599
whole international community was coming together

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.370
there are things like my youtube channel

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.040
where there can be four million people

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.510
who can watch or subscribe to a channel

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.670
that's about information about learning

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.920
new things about the universe. Right?

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.890
The whole rise of smart content on youtube I

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.630
took as an indication that things were

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.819
going in the right direction that here

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.970
we can get communities together who are

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.079
all interested in the same sort of the

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.180
in the same quick high-level phenomena you know

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.329
the same like if I made a TV show I

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.480
could never convince anyone to make a an

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.880
episode about interpretations of quantum

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.980
mechanics I could never convince someone

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.560
to make a video about pilot wave theory

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.170
and go in as much depth as I went into

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.209
my videos but on the internet you can

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.790
find that audience because you can

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.670
aggregate across the whole world so

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.310
little niche audiences across every

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.049
country can all come together and say

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.450
you know we want to learn this and we

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.250
can support this sort of enterprise you

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.299
guys an agreement

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.750
ok now here's the problem, what I didn't

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.900
think about was that other communities

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.239
can form. Communities where people are

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.700
particular agendas ideological or

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.980
religious or you know people with

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.669
extreme biases normally they're not much

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.620
of a force to reckon with because they

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.930
are diluted in our populations but on

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.000
the internet just like the people who

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.459
love physics people who hate

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.100
science or people with differing

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.600
ideologies and people who are intolerant

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.280
can find each other and they can come

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.639
together into these camps so I think

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.680
that starts to suggest why we have the

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.430
problem that we have today and then what

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.259
do people do once they've found their

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.509
communities once they found their people

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:43.020
well we have meetups but we also we

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.660
share things with each other online and

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.039
you can think about some communities

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.810
that are really innocous like the

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.090
communities of people who are cat lovers

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.220
who love sharing like pictures of

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.080
kittens and then someone gets the idea

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.090
to write like a really cute phrase like

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.400
"i can haz cheezburger" on a picture of a

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.500
kitten and then that little image

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.599
tickles our brains in a way that is

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:05.070
you're really strong and really

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.690
incredible and then that spreads

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.610
throughout the internet and what you

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.009
have in essence is kind of evolution

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:13.740
taking place and evolution of ideas on

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.710
the internet and so I guess what I mean

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.990
is you know one person can post this

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.639
picture of a cat and then people can

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.370
vary the phrases that are on it and the

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.320
the best phrase is going to win out and

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.750
get itself replicated and shared across

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.900
the web more than any other, and the same

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.759
thing happens with ideological arguments

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.009
right if there's some sort of debate

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:36.000
that's happening on the internet

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.120
different versions of arguments can pop

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.940
up and when you think about two groups

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.250
on the internet debating they're not

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.039
really debating each other each

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.639
community creates what they think the

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.460
opponent's argument is and then people

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.050
within that community can tweak that

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.360
argument to make it worse and worse and

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.270
worse to make it but the most awful

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.979
version of itself that pushes our

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:03.870
buttons and when it pushes our buttons

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.030
then we share it with everyone we know

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.250
and we say look at the other side is

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.830
talking about look at how awful it

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.759
is and we keep evolving the ideas to

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.729
make them really really bad those are

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:19.229
the ones that that gets shared and

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.810
spread just like an evolution we are

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.270
evolving arguments to make them the

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.430
worst form of themselves and then to

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.740
make the the pushback you know even

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.400
worse and that I think is leading to

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.110
this polarization

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.210
and what's worse the internet is

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.060
organized by algorithms, algorithms that

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.970
are designed to take the things that are

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.980
most engaged with, that most push

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.780
our buttons that get us going and get a

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.150
sharing and liking or hating and they

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.920
promote those even further and this I

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.660
think is where something like fake news

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.440
comes in

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.290
how is it possible that during the last

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.720
election cycle in the U.S. more fake

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.180
news was spread and shared than real

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.440
news that is extraordinary and I think

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.360
it happens because the Internet allows

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.300
groups of people to come together who

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.950
have really particular views it allows

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.270
them to share things with each other

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.520
even sharing what they think the

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.070
opponent's argument is tweaking it ever

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.540
so slightly doing all of these little

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.490
mutations little alterations and finding

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.040
the ones that push our buttons the most

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.540
and then those are the ones that get

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.460
shared those are the ones that get liked

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.100
and hated and everything and those are

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.690
the ones the algorithm elevates the very

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.540
top, so rather than the

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.130
internet bringing us together rather

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.470
than us converging around the facts

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.500
instead the Internet allows us to divide

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.860
ourselves into factions and to have this

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.860
crazy evolution of arguments which is

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.320
facilitated by the algorithms pushing us

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:02.190
ever further apart and that is the

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.250
the best that I've been able to reason

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:09.600
about why we now care less about facts

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.970
than we ever did before because deep

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.930
down each one of us is based on

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:20.130
confirmation bias we naturally go out

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.050
into our world and we seek things that

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:23.790
agree with what we think rather than

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.770
looking for things that disagree with

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.140
what we think that's an innate human

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.810
trait as you can see my video can you

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.000
solve this

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.430
so it's upsetting and I think we need to

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:41.669
find a way to overcome this division and

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:45.510
find a way to agree again on what is

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.100
truth and what is not

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:59.980
thank you. (applause)

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.730
Alright, alright, so are there questions? Anyone

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.080
a question or comment we have a

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.700
gentleman down the front yes I'm you

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.560
know that has a video on

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.600
cyber balkanization I've heard it from

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.220
Vsauce is very useful term.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.870
say it again, cyber vulcanization?

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.360
Balkanization. Balkanization? Yeah the

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.920
'spliternet' you know

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.140
everything so the 'splinternet' and i

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.190
love it!

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:24.910
Cyber balkanization. I don't know what

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.510
balkanization is... I guess it has something to do with the political situation in The Balkans

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:39.460
Oh cyber balkanization yeah yeah yeahs

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.470
shout-out to CGP Grey's video here

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:45.400
yes this idea that you should try you

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.050
should think of your opinions like

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.630
papers in a box if you find another

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.730
opinion that is better than the opinion

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:52.660
that you have in the box

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.730
you should switch it out is not

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.980
the believers you are not their opinions

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.230
opinions are just like stuff to carry

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.300
with you that should be easily changed

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.480
very good point I also I should cite

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.460
CGP Grey's video about the evolution of ideas

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.840
because I was strongly influenced by

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.550
that video I think it's one of his

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.080
best and most important videos.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:15.970
yes so mechanics that involves strong

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.760
ideas that polarize people do you think

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.790
there's a way to utilize this

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:25.120
mechanic to make danger better to

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.430
bring us all together to not being

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.740
pushed around but it by utilizing to

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.290
better stuff. Right,

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.240
I mean I personally think that the

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.770
mechanics has brought us here to

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:38.350
division is not in its current form

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.690
going to lead us to convergence so I

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:42.220
think something has to change about the

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.500
mechanics and if I think about one of

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.660
these options right who is saying about

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.280
the ideas that being the paper and you

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.570
should really swap them out

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:51.520
it's a very sophisticated mature idea

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.890
right? Very sophisticated and mature to

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.350
think that we can have our belief set

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:58.600
down and then when they get challenged

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.300
we can think about them and and swap

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.740
them out for new ones that's not

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.630
something that humans like to do

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:08.410
it's hard I was recently in the

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.240
Netherlands and the guy who is driving

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.800
this van, we were going around shooting a

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.370
TV series, guy was driving the van

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.970
talking to me about electric cars and he

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.920
was saying to me Derek you know that

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.420
even if you get like a low emissions or

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.060
zero emissions car and electric car, half

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.890
of the emissions of any vehicle come

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.570
from the production of the vehicle in

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.029
the first place. So, really if you think

00:11:29.029 --> 00:11:30.080
you're cutting down a lot of the

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.370
emissions of your vehicle by getting an

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.740
electric car, which full disclosure, I do

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.100
have, he's saying you're not

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.320
really you know dramatically decreasing

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.640
the emissions because still half the

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.950
emissions happen when the car was made

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:46.130
so a better strategy than buying

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:47.960
all-electric cars would be to not buy

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.310
any cars at all and just keep driving

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.050
your car is a few years longer because

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:52.190
that's going to save a lot more because

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.170
you know a lot of the waste is upfront

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:55.940
and I did not believe him.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.040
I was like that is crazy half of the emissions

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.020
half, like I know it's hard to make a car

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.300
but half of the emissions and you think it's

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.400
gonna drive for you know hundreds and

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.650
hundreds of thousands of kilometers and

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.690
I went and I looked it up and it was

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:11.960
true and I take his piece of paper and

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:18.920
swap it in and I move mine out. But I

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.540
think it's a really hard thing to do and

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.100
it is something that like I felt

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.080
repulsed by like I didn't want to swap

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.000
my piece of paper out that's why I think

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.420
I don't know that that can be the solution

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:29.930
wholesale because we can't just say to

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:31.940
everyone hang on a lot of you have

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.470
beliefs that are not true

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:34.910
can we just swap some paper out with

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:40.160
you just say "NO THAT'S MY PAPER!" and so I

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.380
was going to say to me the thing that

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.610
needs to change

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:45.080
I would say is some of the systems and

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.400
particularly the algorithms.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.459
Because I think Facebook and I think

00:12:49.459 --> 00:12:51.140
they are looking at this now needs to

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.970
figure out a way not to elevate take

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:55.880
news but to let it languish and promote

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.250
real news. They have a responsibility

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.589
because they are curating the feeds of a

00:13:00.589 --> 00:13:02.209
billion people around the world they

00:13:02.209 --> 00:13:03.320
have the responsibility to make sure

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.140
those feeds are not misleading and that

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.390
is something that they were bad about

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:11.420
doing in the last election.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.390
Yep. If you're determined to find the real

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.370
news you go out on a marathon of

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:18.500
research and usually you dig deeper and

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.829
deeper past the sort of 'junk' that's

00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:23.839
being catered to us by the algorithms

00:13:23.839 --> 00:13:25.360
but

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.040
what you're essentially proposing some

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.260
sort of a lie detector to be implemented

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.079
in algorithms that's kind of hard to do

00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:34.870
right unless it's manually altered but

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:37.810
"uh oh" company's Facebook like I don't think

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.550
you can manually alter the algorithm I I

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:41.019
think you have to find a way and I think

00:13:41.019 --> 00:13:42.910
the algorithms can be made I think it's

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:44.890
a big challenge i agree with you but I

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.240
think there's a way to do it i mean if

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.010
you look at Google search results there's

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.170
constantly people trying to game what

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:52.120
Google is doing but you don't end up

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.310
with fake news sites at the top you

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.500
don't end up with spam sites coming up

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.970
top in the Google search results.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:59.019
That's because they battled and battled

00:13:59.019 --> 00:14:01.570
and battled to find these signals that

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.300
that separate what's a valuable site what's

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.100
a site that people appreciate and seems

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:07.899
to be linked into a whole bunch of other

00:14:07.899 --> 00:14:09.970
sites which are all part of a factual

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.370
web right and I think that similarly

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.350
Facebook needs to do something like that

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:15.880
we're in essence they look for signals

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:20.019
of truth. I agree, very hard, and it's

00:14:20.019 --> 00:14:21.790
gonna be a constant battle, but I think

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.230
you need to look for the signal of truth

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:24.940
rather than just the signal of what

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.680
pushes people's buttons.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:33.579
yeah, ... if yout look back at say the stone age if

00:14:33.579 --> 00:14:35.769
you had a weird opinion and you're in your

00:14:35.769 --> 00:14:37.630
little tribe either you convinced

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.850
everyone or you change your mind. Right?

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.160
So you know Facebook is kind of like our

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.860
tribe right so some people use Facebook

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.839
is more like oh these are my aquantences

00:14:46.839 --> 00:14:48.279
but a lot of people use it like these

00:14:48.279 --> 00:14:50.380
are my close friends if a close friend

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.390
said something weird about up something

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.490
on Facebook you comment, right? You have a

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.769
discussion and you know you don't say no

00:14:56.769 --> 00:14:58.510
you're wrong I'm not going to talk to

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:00.230
you anymore right because he's your friend

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:04.320
or do you change your mind ou you convince the other person, right? But if

00:15:04.329 --> 00:15:06.190
you go on like Reddit you're not going

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:08.230
to convince like 10 million billion

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:11.980
people so yeah I don't know maybe like

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.570
if you've ever liked tried the

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:15.910
controversial tab on Reddit that's usually

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:17.110
where some of the most of the interesting

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:19.300
discussions are but yes sometimes it's not so important.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.529
And I think this brings me to one of my

00:15:23.529 --> 00:15:25.209
kind of points that i think is a little

00:15:25.209 --> 00:15:27.670
bit counter-intuitive and it's a point that's

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:29.260
difficult for me to think about I I'm

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:33.279
still not settled on this idea but I

00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:35.529
wonder sometimes that arguing just makes

00:15:35.529 --> 00:15:37.660
things worse you know as someone who

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.980
makes science films I

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.959
if I go out make a film about

00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:43.329
something that's controversial I don't

00:15:43.329 --> 00:15:45.070
know if maybe I'm just making it worse

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.660
and so I i think we ought to think about

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.310
that really carefully before we engage

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.560
in discussions which is: Is there a

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.269
chance by making these points which you

00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:53.709
think are really clear and really get at

00:15:53.709 --> 00:15:55.630
the truth is it possible that you were

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:57.940
just causing the other side to be more

00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.980
deeply entrenched in their beliefs in

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.540
the first place? Down here.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:06.670
Do you think that adapting to algorithms identify true

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:09.370
statements can have some issues with like

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.800
separating truth. Like uncontroversial

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.750
statements from

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.480
controversial than what's

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.230
uncontroversial it will more likely seem true,

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.860
yeah I get you there, as said, I don't

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.110
know the solution I think it is hard but

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.630
I do think we have to figure it out.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:30.760
I think that there are places on the web

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.790
that have a good record of truth,

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:35.920
Wikipedia for example, for all of its

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.230
ability to be edited is still more

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.820
likely than not to be true so I think

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.130
there's all these places that do signal

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:45.160
true things I think you know CNN is more

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.019
likely to be true then Breitbart News, so

00:16:47.019 --> 00:16:51.699
I mean there has got to be some signal

00:16:51.699 --> 00:16:54.790
and the noise, some way to trace back

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.529
references and things right some of the

00:16:56.529 --> 00:17:03.579
things we talked about were some of the

00:17:03.579 --> 00:17:04.780
things we talked about where manual

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.360
intervention or or deeply searching

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.740
right going back and looking at all

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.089
these different sources

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:11.290
that's something that most humans don't

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.839
do and won't do and can't do don't have

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:15.790
the time to do that's what I'm saying a

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:19.299
machine can look at references, a machine

00:17:19.299 --> 00:17:23.679
can look at signals that spread you know

00:17:23.679 --> 00:17:25.150
and then they can do that very rapidly

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:26.799
so you want to find out who are these

00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:28.510
people do they have a record of you know

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:30.100
falsely are they actually accredited

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.260
already in university there's there are

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.630
a variety of things that you can do to

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:37.809
see whether things have a true

00:17:37.809 --> 00:17:40.030
signal or not I don't think it's easy

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.340
but I think it's possible. Yes.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.510
There are traditional news medias that may

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:50.480
present the news or these articles fake or not

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.530
to the public,

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.920
don't you think they sort of had part of

00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:01.500
the blame because they fact checked

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.250
those fake articles when the results

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.280
already were in like all these

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.000
statements were said and then when the

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.060
results were in say in the last election

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.330
they just want "Oh wait, these statements

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.800
were they true?

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.830
Oh wait they weren't but too late

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:26.430
to alter the results from all statements

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.080
yeah but I think there was a lot of light

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.520
fact-checking but it didn't seem to do

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.780
anything like people didn't seem to care

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.180
about facts and that deep down is the

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:34.770
the real question I want to get the

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:36.780
answer to which is why don't people

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.090
seem to care what's true and I guess

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:42.510
maybe rather than putting it that way

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:45.870
there were different camps which each

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.550
had their own narratives and their own

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.140
things that they believed was true and

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:52.110
it was different from the other side and

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.750
so figuring out what true was

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.490
really hard especially if you were

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.550
completely in one camp I mean there were

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.200
there were fake things around on both

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:06.830
yeah.
