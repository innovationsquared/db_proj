00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
A few months ago, I made a video about Schlieren imaging.

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.840
Now that's a technique used to visualise tiny differences in air either temperature, pressure, composition,

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.480
so you can see things like the heat that comes off when you light a match.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.100
Now in that video I asked you for some ideas for what you'd like to see in this Schlieren setup,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.580
and I will be showing you some of those in this video.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.740
But I also saw that there was a lot of confusion about how exactly the setup works

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.120
and so I want to clear up that confusion

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.500
before we get going. So one thing is this mirror.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.700
I said is a parabolic mirror, but then I said you can think of it as a part of a sphere

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:46.300
and so people rightly called me out and said well if it's parabolic it can't be part of a sphere. While that is true,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.400
it's such a small part of

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.540
a sphere or parabola

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.580
that the two shapes are pretty similar on this scale,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.240
so you could say it approximates a sphere

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:03.000
and you would not be as far off as say in physics when we say this cow

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:11.009
Approximates a sphere. Now a parabolic concave mirror is a pretty good approximation for a spherical concave mirror. Now the second major

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.420
question is how do you get enough light to make this work. I mean some of those shots

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.199
I was showing you were shot at 2,000 frames per second and using only one tiny LED as the light source.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.239
How could that even work? Well, I had similar kind of concerns when I was going to set this up

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.259
and so I sought out the most powerful flashlights that I could find.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.620
I figured this would be my light source so that light bounces off the mirror. Now the focal length of my mirror is

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.420
1.8

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.540
meters which means that the light converges at the center of curvature,

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.169
which is two times the focal length, 3.6 meters back

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.189
and you can see that here the reflected light that comes off the mirror is

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.450
converging on this card that I'm holding up. You can see as we get closer and closer... right there look at how sharply...

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.459
We have an image of the flashlight. It passes and

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.340
forms a spot back here.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.780
This is essentially an image of the mirror and look how bright it is. We have daylight outside. Okay,

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.519
that's very bright, but you can still see this spot, which comes completely from the flashlight. Now

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.630
let me try to set up something in front of the mirror that will produce a bit of a schlieren pattern and let's check

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.260
how that looks. You can actually see the schlieren effect, and you might notice this is not a

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.770
fantastic schlieren image, and that's because, of course,

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.760
this is not a point source of light

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.899
so my first thought was cover it with tin foil and make a hole on the front to reduce the size of

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.099
the light source. Now that has decreased the brightness of this image, but it's still pretty bright and

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.550
you can actually see a really nice

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.310
flaring effect that's taking place

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.529
already right here, so if you imagine sending all of that light down the lens of a camera,

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.219
it's actually a pretty bright image, not a dim one, but if this works and produces the schlieren effect

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.220
we're looking for then why do you need the razor blade? Well,

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.660
here's the thing. The differences in refractive index that we're talking about are very very tiny, so

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.890
the way the light is deflected is just by the tiniest of degrees,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.129
So that light actually will end up right here

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.730
in this focal point with all the rest of the light because all of the light from the mirror is getting sent back to this spot.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.619
But some of it the light that's been deflected will be just ever so slightly off

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.960
and if you use this razor blade to knock off about half of that bright spot,

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.899
you will be cutting off more of that light, which has been deflected and by cutting it off,

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.329
you will increase the contrast in the image.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.010
Now, as some of you pointed out, an alternative to using the razor blade to cut the light is

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.020
using colored filters, so here I got two different colors of cellophane

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.139
and if I position that so that the

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.079
focal point is right in the middle of the divide then some of the light will pass through this

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.020
magenta side and some will go through the cyan side. Have a look what happens when I put this

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.330
transparent helium balloon in front of the mirror. Now the helium just deflects the light a tiny amount,

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.650
but it's enough so that instead of going through the magenta side it goes through the cyan side

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.469
and that's why the balloon looks a different color, but what happens if I pop it?

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:38.029
Do you see that after the balloon pops, the helium kind of stays together and rises in the shape of a balloon?

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:50.119
Another thing you suggested was lighting a barbecue lighter with a match, so I'm just gonna release some gas

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.999
I'm gonna let the flame travel up the gas

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:09.628
and the schlieren you can see the flame traveling out and through that gas up to light the lighter.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.789
Yeah. I'm gonna try blowing a bubble with rainbow schlieren.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.200
Another crazy idea of yours was to light a ping-pong ball on fire because

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.999
ping-pong balls, the good ones anyway, that they use in actual tournaments are quite flammable.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.330
So I'm gonna see how that looks. Whoa! It's caught fire!

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.689
Look at it go! Oh that is awesome!

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.990
Now a lot of your recommendations involve sound, for example, trying to see a clap. I

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.140
tried this again and again

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:28.289
and I tried looking for a shock wave, but it was pretty hard to see even at 2,000 frames per second

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:34.170
and that's because with the speed of sound being over 300 meters per second, even at that speed you would only catch

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.170
maybe one or two

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.640
frames. That would include the shock wave in them

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.719
and I found it almost impossible to see. So looking at all these claps,

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.860
you can see the air getting pushed out from between my fingers,

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.809
but that's not traveling at the speed of sound, so it's not the actual sound of the clap.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.320
So I'm gonna have to call in some backup if we're going to do some schlieren

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.730
with sound. So thank you for all of your suggestions. If you have any others,

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:04.140
please leave them in the comments below, though it may take me a little while to get back to you because next week

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.689
I'm flying to Australia and on the plane

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.360
I will be listening to the sponsor of this episode of Veritasium,

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.009
which is, of course, Audible. Audible has an unbeatable selection of audio books read by

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.119
amazing readers. They can be the authors of the books or great actors.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.240
I think it's really the best way to get books into your life

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.069
and if you're viewing this video, Audible will offer a free 30-day trial to you. By going to audible.com/veritasium,

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.440
you can download an audio book of your choosing for free, so that's a pretty cool

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.780
deal
and the book that I'm listening to at the moment is

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.750
Algorithms To Live By. This is what I'll be listening to on the plane.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:43.110
It's about the intersection of computer science and human decision-making ,so if you're trying to optimize your life

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.219
how can the lessons of computer science apply to making your life better?

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.740
You know I'm fascinated by

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:54.509
optimizing my life and also by computer science, so this is a really cool book.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.420
I'm enjoying it so far, and I can't wait for that plane ride.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.789
I find that having an audio book really

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:05.610
changes the idea of a commute and makes it go from a real drag to being something that I kind of look forward to because,

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:06.720
I wanna get back to my book.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:12.809
