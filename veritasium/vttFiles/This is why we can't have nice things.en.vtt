00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.440
- This is a video about things like cars,

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.150
phones, and light bulbs
and an actual conspiracy

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.593
that made them worse.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.760
This video was sponsored by NordVPN,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.650
more about them at the end of the video

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.130
I am outside Livermore
Fire Station, number six.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.650
And in here, they have the longest,

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.900
continuously on light bulb in the world.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.540
It has been on for 120 years

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.810
since 1901.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.643
There it is.

00:00:32.643 --> 00:00:34.030
- [Host] Yeah, that's it.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.700
- It's not even connected
to a light switch

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.210
but it does have a backup
battery and generator.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.650
So the big question is,

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.430
how has this light bulb lasted so long?

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.890
It was manufactured by hand not long

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.510
after commercial light
bulbs were first invented,

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.080
And yet, it has been running
for over a million hours,

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.580
way longer than any light
bulb today is meant to last.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.090
Awhile back, a friend of
mine told me this story,

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.550
that someone had invented a light bulb

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.890
that would last forever years ago,

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.420
but they never sold it

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.140
because an everlasting light bulb makes

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.030
for a terrible business model.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.640
I mean, you would never
have any repeat customers

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.160
and eventually you would run out

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.630
of people to sell light bulbs to,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.690
I thought this story sounded ridiculous.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.140
If you could make an
everlasting light bulb,

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.040
then everyone would buy your light bulb

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.430
over the competitors.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.260
And so you could charge
really high prices,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.070
make a lot of money, even if
demand would eventually dry up.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.590
I just couldn't imagine that
we had better light bulbs

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.260
in the past and then
intentionally made them worse,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.280
but it turns out I was wrong.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.530
At least sort of.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.860
Inventing a viable
electric light was hard,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.090
I mean, this is the typical
incandescent design,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.960
which just involves
passing electric current

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.230
through a material making
it so hot that it glows,

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.950
less than 5% of the electrical
energy comes out as light.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.170
The other 95% is released as heat.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.190
So these are really heat bulbs,

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.510
which give off a little bit
of light as a by-product.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.450
The temperature of the filament
can get up to 2,800 Kelvin.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.220
That is half as hot as
the surface of the sun.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.489
At temperatures like
those, most materials melt.

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:15.750
- That's so cool.
- And if they don't melt,

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.190
they burn,

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.340
which is why in the 1840s,
Warren De la Rue came

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.190
up with the idea of putting
the filament in a vacuum bulb,

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.120
so there's no oxygen to react with.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.160
By 1879, Thomas Edison had made a bulb

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.800
with a cotton thread filament
that lasted 14 hours.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.550
Other inventors created
bulbs with platinum filaments

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.640
or other carbonized materials.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.520
And gradually, the lifespan
of bulbs increased.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.430
The filaments changed
from carbon to tungsten,

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.650
which has a very high melting point.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.610
And by the early 1920s,
average bulb lifetimes

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.610
were approaching 2,000 hours
with some lasting 2,500 hours.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.360
But this is when lifetimes
stopped getting longer

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.830
and started getting shorter.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.620
In Geneva, Switzerland just
before Christmas, 1924,

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.120
there was a secret
meeting of top executives

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.640
from the world's leading
light bulb companies,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.340
Phillips, International General Electric,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.020
Tokyo Electric, OSRAM from Germany,

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.550
and the UK's Associated
Electric among others.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.070
They formed what became known

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.620
as the Phoebus Cartel named after Phoebus,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.840
the Greek God of light.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.880
There, all these companies agreed

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.740
to work together to help each other

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.140
by controlling the world
supply of light bulbs.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.170
In the early days of
the electrical industry,

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.800
there had been lots of different

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.800
small light bulb manufacturers,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.750
but by now they had
largely been consolidated

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.540
into these big corporations,

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.480
each dominant in a
particular part of the world.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.400
The biggest threat they all faced was

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.770
from longer lasting light bulbs.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.657
For example, in 1923, OSRAM
sold 63 million light bulbs,

00:03:58.657 --> 00:04:02.180
but the following year
they sold only 28 million.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.250
Light bulbs were lasting
too long, eating into sales.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.800
So all the companies in the cartel agreed

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.180
to reduce the lifespan of their bulbs

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.180
to 1,000 hours cutting the
existing average almost in half.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.800
But how could each company ensure

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.630
that the other companies would
actually follow the rules

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.000
and make shorter lasting light bulb.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.480
After all, it would be in each
of their individual interests

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.760
to make a better product
to outsell the others?

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.900
Well, to enforce the 1,000 hour limit,

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.530
each of the manufacturers
have to send in sample bulbs

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.470
from their factories and they
were tested on big test stands

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.080
like this one.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.460
If a bulb lasted

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.060
significantly longer than
1,000 thousand hours,

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.180
then the company was fined.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.260
If a bulb lasted longer than 3000 hours,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.680
well the fine was 200 Swiss Francs

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.530
for every 1,000 bulbs sold.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.670
And there are records

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.850
of these fines being issued to companies.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.690
But how do you make a worst
light bulb in the first place?

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.100
Well, the same engineers who
had previously been tasked

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.330
with extending the lifespan
now had to find ways

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.650
to decrease it.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.660
So they tried different materials,

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.250
different shaped filaments,
and thinner connections.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.410
And if you look at the
data, they were successful.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.300
Ever since the formation of the cartel.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.400
the lifespan of light
bulbs steadily decreased.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.400
So that by 1934, the average
lifespan was just 1,205 hours.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.310
And just as they had
planned, sales increased

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.310
for cartel members by 25% in
the four years after 1926.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.390
And even though the cost
of components came down,

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.520
the cartel kept prices
virtually unchanged,

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.400
so they increased their profit margins.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.200
So did people know that
the light bulb companies

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.330
were conspiring together to
make their products worse?

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.540
No, the Phoebus Cartel
claimed that its purpose was

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.360
to increase standardization
and efficiency of light bulbs.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.460
I mean, they did establish
this screw thread is standard.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.450
You can find it on
virtually all light bulbs

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.240
around the world now.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.870
But all evidence points to
the cartels being motivated

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.210
by profits and increased sales,

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.090
not by what was best for consumers.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.240
So one of the reasons this
light bulb has lasted so long is

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.520
because it was made before the cartel era.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.420
Another reason is because the
filament has always been run

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.640
at low power, just four or five watts.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.150
It was meant to be a nightlight

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.100
for the fire station to
provide just enough light

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.240
so that firemen wouldn't
run into things at night.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.370
And the fact that it was always

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.250
on reduced the thermal cycling

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.220
of the filament and components
limiting the stress caused

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.593
by thermal expansion and contraction.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.420
The Phoebus Cartel was
initially planned to last

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:52.420
at least until 1955, but
it fell apart in the 1930s.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.500
It was already struggling
due to outside competition.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.200
And non-compliance amongst
some of its members,

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.030
but the outbreak of World War II is

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.960
really what finished it off.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.600
So this cartel was dead,

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.820
but its methods survived to this day.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.650
There are lots of companies out there

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.010
that intentionally shortened
the lifespan of their products

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.673
it's a tactic known now
as planned obsolescence.

00:07:17.716 --> 00:07:20.400
This was actually the
subject of Casey Neistat's

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.637
first viral video all
the way back in 2003.

00:07:23.637 --> 00:07:25.840
- [Support] Thank you for
calling Apple, my name is Ryan.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.390
May I have your first name please?

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.280
- [Casey] Casey.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.113
- [Support] ] All right, and what seems

00:07:29.113 --> 00:07:30.013
to be the issue today?

00:07:30.013 --> 00:07:32.760
- [Casey] I have an iPod that
I bought about 18 months ago

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.169
and the battery is dead on it.

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:36.900
- [Support] 18 months,
okay, it's past it year,

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.790
which basically means there'll be a charge

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:44.390
of $255 plus a mailing
fee to send it to us

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.040
to refurbish, to correct it.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.740
But at that price, you might
as well go get a new one.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.360
- [Narrator] This video
got millions of views

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.160
in a time before YouTube or social media.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.480
And it spawned a class action lawsuit,

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.000
which Apple settled out of court,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.240
but it didn't stop the company

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.500
from practicing planned obsolescence.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.320
After an iOS update in 2017,

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.820
users of older iPhones found apps loading

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.020
significantly slower or the
device shutting down altogether.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.340
Apple said they throttled
performance to protect the battery

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.510
of older devices and
increase their longevity.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.150
Of course, that wouldn't be an issue

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.760
if the battery were replaceable.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.810
In a series of lawsuits
that concluded in 2020,

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.010
Apple was fined or reached settlements

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.380
to pay hundreds of millions of dollars,

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.020
undoubtedly, this amount
pales in comparison

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.660
to the extra revenue they generate

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.343
by limiting the lifespan
of their products.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.680
But some would argue that
planned obsolescence isn't

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.210
just about greed, but that
it's also good for everyone.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.770
During the great depression in the 1930s

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.704
when as much as 1/4 of
Americans were out of work

00:08:54.704 --> 00:08:57.320
and real estate broker Bernard London

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.180
proposed mandatory planned obsolescence

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.610
as a way to get people back to work

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.070
and lift America out of the depression.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.610
He wrote, "I would have the
government assign a lease

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.710
of life to shoes, and homes, and machines

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:11.470
when they are first created

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.790
and they would be sold
and used within the term

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:17.350
of their existence, definitely
known by the consumer.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.270
After the allotted time had expired,

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:21.740
these things would be legally dead

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.410
and would be controlled by the duly

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.520
appointed governmental
agency and destroyed

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.410
if there is widespread unemployment."

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.490
Now, this might sound
like a wild fringe idea,

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.250
but people were clearly afraid
of being put out of work

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:39.440
by technological progress and
products that were too good.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.617
There was even a popular
Oscar nominated film about it.

00:09:42.617 --> 00:09:47.160
"This is the man in the
white suit from 1951."

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.260
It's about a scientist who
invents the perfect fiber.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.670
It won't stain or break, or fray.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.660
- I think I've succeeded

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.190
in the copolymerization
of amino acid residues

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:59.893
and carbohydrate molecules,
both containing ionic groups.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.350
It's really perfectly simple.

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.240
- [Narrator] The Academy
award nomination was

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.683
for best screenplay, I kid you not.

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:11.210
Anyway, everyone is initially excited

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.640
about our heroes scientific discovery.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.580
He makes a suit out of the
thread and it has to be white

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.270
because the fiber is so stain resistant,

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.040
it can't even be dyed,

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.460
but this is when trouble strikes,

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.410
the factory owners realize
they won't be able to sell

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.060
as much of this thread
because it's so durable.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.730
And the workers worry it'll
put them out of a job.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:34.923
- Why can't you scientists
leave things alone?

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.770
What about my better washing
when there's no washing to do?

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.720
- This is when you get the climactic scene

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.010
where factory workers and
factory owners team up

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.700
to chase down the scientist to destroy him

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.550
and his invention.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.610
And believe it or not, this
movie may have been inspired

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.140
by real events.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:59.040
In the 1940s, the synthetic
fiber nylon replaced silk

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.260
in stockings, and it was so durable

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.010
that the products became
an overnight sensation.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.550
There were literal riots when women tried

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:08.200
to get their hands on them.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.090
When the manufacturers realized

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.320
they had made the product too good,

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.480
they didn't destroy the fiber,

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.640
but they did follow the
example of the Phoebus Cartel.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.070
They instructed their
engineers and scientists

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.710
to find ways to weaken the
product to shorten its lifespan,

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:26.220
so people would have to buy more.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.020
Now, it seems like consumers
are finally fighting back

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.770
against planned obsolescence.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:34.300
In the European union and
in over 25 states in the US,

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.850
there's proposed legislation

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.730
to enshrine the right to repair.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:40.620
And these laws would force manufacturers

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.480
to make it easier to
repair their products.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.130
They would have to provide
information and access to parts.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.130
So you could replace a battery
or fix a cracked screen

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:52.320
at a third-party repair shop
without voiding your warranty.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.090
So if right to repair does become law,

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:56.870
does that mean artificial obsolescence

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.570
will be gone for good?

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.850
Sadly, no, because there is

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.970
one last thing manufacturers can use

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:06.914
to make their products
obsolete, which is you.

00:12:06.914 --> 00:12:08.610
(instrumental music)

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:11.220
Henry Ford released the
first mass market car,

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.430
the model T in 1908.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:15.930
And he envisioned it like a workhorse,

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.270
an affordable tool that wouldn't wear out,

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.680
a bit like the everlasting light bulb.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.680
In 1922 Ford said, "We want the
man who buys one of our cars

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.690
never to have to buy another,
we never make an improvement

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.467
that renders any previous model obsolete."

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:36.390
But by 1920, 55% of American
families already owned a car.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.620
Nearly everyone that
could afford one had one.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:40.740
And that same year,

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.610
there was a small economic
downturn driving down sales

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.313
for both Ford and General Motors.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:51.570
In 1921, DuPont, the chemical
and paint company took

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.270
over the controlling
share in General Motors.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.630
And they started experimenting

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.890
with painting cars different colors,

00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:59.840
up until then, Henry Ford had said,

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.900
you could have whatever color you like

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.270
so long as it's black.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:07.800
It took a couple of years
of testing, but in 1924,

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.890
GM released their first
cars in different colors.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.100
And soon after, they introduced a trick

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.030
that feels very familiar now.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.880
Each new year,

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.003
they would introduce
cars in different colors.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:24.460
The goal wasn't just to make
Ford's model T lookout dated,

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.320
but to make their own cars
feel outdated every year

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.530
encouraging customers to
trade in their old cars

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:32.210
for shiny new ones.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.830
Years later, GM's head
of design, Harley Earl,

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.910
candidly discussed his role in creating

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.787
what he called dynamic obsolescence.

00:13:39.787 --> 00:13:42.750
"Our big job is to hasten obsolescence.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:46.580
In 1934, the average car
ownership span was five years.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:50.440
Now, which was 1955, it is two years.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.340
When it is one year, we
will have a perfect score.

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.100
By the time he said this,
General Motors was the

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.750
most valuable company in
the world and it's sold half

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.723
of all vehicles purchased
in the US every year.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.860
These days, the world's
most valuable company,

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:13.220
Apple, seems to have copied
directly out of this playbook.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.520
I mean, new styles every year, check,

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.270
new special colors every year, check,

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.310
marginal technological improvement, check.

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:25.000
I mean, is this useful
innovation or just a gimmick?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.630
The inspiration for General
Motors and hence for Apple comes

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:33.120
from fashion where real
innovation is all but impossible.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.930
So the only way to make
people feel the urgency

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.860
to get out there and
buy is to create styles

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.310
that last but one season.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:42.790
The trouble then is you run

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.260
through these styles too quickly.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.990
And then what are you supposed to do?

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:49.720
Well, just recycle the styles
from a few decades ago.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.040
The iPhone also shows
this recycling trend.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.190
I mean, just look at
the way the edges were

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:58.200
initially rounded and
then they were squared off

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.840
and then they were rounded again

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.410
and now, they're squared off.

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:02.350
And how much do you want to bet

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:05.270
that the iPhone 14 has rounded edges?

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.880
I think the point is that
with design and styling,

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.050
there is no best, there's only different,

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:13.110
which is apparently enough to remind us

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:15.120
that we don't have the
latest and greatest,

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.270
and so we have to rush
out and keep buying.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.940
The only type of obsolescence

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.600
we should support is technological,

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.550
which brings us back to the light bulb.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.760
In the last 20 years,
light bulbs have gone

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.840
from incandescent, which
was basically unchanged

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.230
for 100 years to compact fluorescent.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:38.990
And now, to LED, these use
just a 10th of the energy

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:42.623
and can last anywhere from
10 to 50 times longer.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:45.340
Yeah, that's pretty bright.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:48.780
So you're more likely to sell your house

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.770
than to have to replace an LED bulb

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.380
that you've installed inside it.

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.680
So we finally reached the point

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.973
of what is essentially an
everlasting light bulb?

00:15:58.973 --> 00:16:01.556
(upbeat music)

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.920
Hey, this video was sponsored by NordVPN.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.467
I am featured in an episode
of the British TV program,

00:16:11.467 --> 00:16:13.890
"QI," it's a show I really like,

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.290
and I'd highly recommend it if
you haven't seen it already.

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.990
And it's on Netflix, but
only if you're in the UK.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:22.170
I feel like TV and film are still trapped

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:23.800
in antiquated business models

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.700
where they divide up the world
into broadcast territories

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.070
that doesn't make a lot of sense

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:31.240
now that information can flow
freely through the Internet.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.310
Luckily using NordVPN,
anyone can set their location

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:37.620
to the UK and watch whatever they like.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.340

to cover your web traffic with
an extra layer of security.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:03.590
NordVPN has a no logs policy,

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.720
of the world's biggest companies
are trying to do right now.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.910
So for privacy, when browsing and access

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:12.960
