00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.500
Now that we have nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants you might think that it was always

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.910
Inevitable that we would be able to harness the energy inside the nucleus of atoms

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:16.170
But that was far from the case in fact serious scientists, thought the idea was laughable like Nobel laureate Robert

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.330
Millikan who in 1928 said there is no likelihood man can ever tap the power of the atom

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.029
The glib supposition of utilizing atomic energy when our coal has run out is a completely unscientific

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:35.309
Utopian dream or as Rutherford put it anyone who expects a source of power from the transformation of these atoms is talking moonshine

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:43.079
now there was good reason for their pessimism when Becquerel first observed to radioactivity he thought it was a phenomenon similar to

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.050
phosphorescence

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.129
That's when you shine radiation like light onto an object

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.529
And it absorbs that energy and later

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.879
Reradiates it in a different part of the spectrum now uranium ore was known to do this as I witnessed firsthand. Oh, yeah

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.260
X yes

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
fluorescent uranium ore

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.720
Yeah

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.059
Here, it's absorbing UV light and reradiating it as visible light in

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.540
1896 Becquerel performed experiments where he placed uranium ore in the sunshine on top of some wrapped up

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.659
Photographic film he found that the film was exposed

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.359
Seemingly by invisible rays from the uranium ore that penetrated the paper when the uranium was excited by the sunlight

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.110
But one day when he went to do his experiment the weather in Paris was lousy so he put the uranium and the photographic film

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.939
Inside a drawer and a few days later even though the uranium hadn't seen the Sun

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.740
He decided to develop the film anyway

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.199
And what he found was that the photographic film had been exposed just as before

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.769
Even though the uranium was not excited by sunlight

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:53.609
So this was not a phosphorescence phenomenon some type of radiation and therefore energy was coming out of a rock

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.659
unprovoked

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.909
But how could a seemingly inert object like a rock give off energy

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.509
Where is it getting that energy from it was a mystery that seemed to violate the law of conservation of energy?

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.289
That is until Einstein published his famous e equals mc-squared

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.869
Which suggested a source of energy for the?

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.560
Might be the mass of the nucleus

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:22.699
Just a tiny bit of mass can give you a lot of energy and this premise was enough for science fiction writers to let their

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.940
Imaginations run wild like HG Wells who in 1914 published the book the world set free

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:37.129
Which includes the first mention of the words atomic bomb he envisioned a uranium based hand grenade that would continue to explode

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:45.439
indefinitely but to scientists this was completely detached from reality as Einstein in 1933 put it there is not the

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.519
slightest indication that nuclear energy will ever be obtainable it would mean that the atom would have to be shattered at will and

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.629
That's just the thing people had no ability to make a nucleus do

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.149
Anything all we were observing was the natural process of radioactive decay atoms of a particular

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.769
Unstable isotope decaying at random with some characteristic half-life

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:13.729
And the energy given off although immense on the scale of an atom is pretty insignificant on the scale of people and the world

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.220
the fission of a single uranium atom releases

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.549
Twenty times less energy than the amount required to raise a grain of sand the thickness of a piece of paper

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:30.529
Now up until 1932 the only known particle in the nucleus was the proton so if you wanted to alter a nucleus you could conceivably

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.329
Fire a proton at it

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.499
But since the nucleus and the proton are both positively charged they repel

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.649
so you'd have to fire the proton in with such high speed and accuracy to get it to hit and stick to a target and

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.709
Even then if you're successful you've only affected one nucleus

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.439
Which at best can't even lift a grain of sand

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.119
So you can see why the Nobel Prize winners were saying nuclear weapons not gonna happen

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:58.339
But then comes the discovery of the neutron and the neutron changes everything

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.759
Because as an uncharged nuclear particle it can drift

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.418
Ghostly undeflected through matter until it hits a nucleus

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.179
Transforming it into something else and this leads to the Epiphany of a man named Leo Szilard

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:17.989
Now's a lard read the world set free, so he's already imagined a future in which nuclear energy is harnessed by weaponry

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.358
And he remembers the exact moment he comes up with this idea as he's crossing the street in London

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:31.159
He says it suddenly occurred to me that if we could find an element which is split by neutrons and which would emit two neutrons

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.770
when it absorbed one Neutron then such an element

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.909
If assembled in sufficiently large mass could sustain a nuclear chain

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.970
reaction

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.620
In other words the neutron

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.940
Enables us to trigger

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:49.070
nuclear reactions at will and if there's a nucleus which when it splits in this way releases two neutrons it could trigger more and more

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.290
Fission's and an exponentially increasing rate the nucleus that has this property is

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.060
uranium-235

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.660
In fact on average it releases two and a half neutrons every time it divides

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.970
Now all of a sudden you have the possibility of splitting zillions of nuclei

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.349
simultaneously releasing incredible amounts of energy all at once

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.140
That's an atomic bomb now if you want more control over this release of energy as in a nuclear power plant

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.650
well

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.549
Then you have to absorb a few neutrons so that the fission of one nucleus only

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.609
Causes the fission of one other nucleus on average

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:29.030
Then you have a steady chain reaction that emits the same amount of energy each instant the challenge is that this is like

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:36.530
Balancing on a knife-edge absorb too many neutrons and the chain reaction quickly decays to nothing absorb too few and the rate of reactions

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:44.029
Increases exponentially and soon you're back to a bomb or Chernobyl so if not for the existence of the neutron a neutral

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:50.779
nuclear particle to trigger reactions that occurs in greater numbers relative to protons in the larger nuclei meaning

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.690
They're likely to be given off when a large nucleus splits well, then maybe as many brilliant scientists suspected

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.630
It would be impossible to harness the energy in the nucleus

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:06.259
But as it is in our universe the neutron is the hero or the villain of nuclear physics

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.659
