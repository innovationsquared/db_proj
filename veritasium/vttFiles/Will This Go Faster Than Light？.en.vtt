00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.580
The speed of light is meant to be the ultimate
speed limit in the universe. According to

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.160
Einstein’s special theory of relativity,
nothing should move through space faster than

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.960
light. But that doesn’t stop people from
trying. Every day I get a lot of messages

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.860
proposing ways to go faster than the speed
of light.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.770
There is the classic method where you shine
a laser at the moon. If you can flick that

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.560
beam across the moon’s surface in less than
a hundredth of a second, which is not hard

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.320
to do, then that laser spot will actually
move across the surface of the moon faster

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.930
than the speed of light. Imagine what that
would look like if you were standing on the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.170
moon. If you were quick enough to perceive
it, you would see this laser spot move faster

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.739
than the light coming out of your own laser.
How is that even possible?

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.620
Well, in truth, nothing here is really travelling
faster than the speed of light. The individual

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.079
particles of light, the photons coming out
of my laser are still traveling to the moon

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.539
at the speed of light. It is just that they
are landing side by side in such quick succession

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.090
that they form a spot which moves faster than
the speed of light. But really it is an illusion,

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.839
nothing is actually going faster than the
speed of light. So you couldn’t transmit

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.020
any information this way.
Dan asked: What if instead of a laser we used

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.270
a long rigid stick instead? Now surely if
you flick your wrist, the tip of this stick

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.670
must move across the surface of the moon,
faster than the speed of light.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.980
Well, unfortunately this won’t work either.
As we learned in the slinky drop experiment,

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.320
the fastest a force can propagate through
an object is the speed of sound, that is because

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.270
each atom needs to bump into the one next
to it to transmit that force. And this is

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.110
a lossy process. So you would be lucky if
you any of the energy you have put in at the

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.440
start actually made it to the tip. You would
be lucky if the tip moved at all.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.880
Now this is a really sophisticated idea. Gerard
writes: A very special space age engine would

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.250
need to be designed that is capable of doing
10,000 plus rpm in outer space with very high

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.200
torque. Consult Elon Musk for this. As the
engine is spinning it slowly deploys two very

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.750
long tethers made from carbon nanotubes on
opposing sides. Eventually each carbon nanotube

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.420
tether reaches an amazing length of 285 kilometers.
At this point, the end of the tether will

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.610
be traveling at the speed of light. Can you
point out some reasons as to why it would

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.140
not work?
Yes, Gerard, yes, I can.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.790
First, any object going in a circle requires
a force pulling it in towards the middle of

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.790
that circle. That is called centripetal force.
And you can feel it when you whirl a ball

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.730
above your head. Now that force is dependent
on the speed of the object squared. So if

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.700
that gets to be too great the tether breaks.
Now if you had a single gram rotating at 99

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.250
percent of the speed of light, the amount
of force required to pull it towards the center

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.849
would be 300 meganewtons. That is the weight
of 6000 fully African elephants. But, you

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.400
are right, carbon nanotubes are tremendously
strong. If you had a fiber just eight centimeters

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.819
wide, you could support all of that force.

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.599
But now he problem is if you have less than
a centimeter of that fiber, it adds another

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.220
gram to the tip of you tether. And so now
you need a thicker fiber in order to support

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.980
that additional force. And that would happen
all the way to the base, so the fiber would

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.620
need to get thicker and thicker and thicker
all the way back to the motor. And if you

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.930
do the calculation you find that basically
30 meters from the tip the fiber already has

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.950
to be as wide as the observable universe in
order to support all of that force. It is

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.639
nuts.
But it gets worse. As an object moves faster

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.790
its inertia actually increases. That means
it requires more force to accelerate it. In

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.660
fact, that one gram mass going 99 percent
the speed of light would require seven times

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.239
the amount of force we calculated before.
And so the tether would have to be even thicker.

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.319
But things get even more problematic if you
think about speeding up the tip of the tether

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.379
that extra one percent to the speed of light.
I mean, since the inertia keeps getting greater

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:46.019
and greater, it requires more and more force
to accelerate it. And, in fact, to speed it

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.260
up that extra little bit to go the speed of
light would require an infinite amount of

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.760
energy.
Ok, well putting the infinite energy aside,

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.150
let’s say we could create an incredible
motor and we could find a material much stronger

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.870
and lighter than carbon nanotube. Is it at
least in principle possible that the tip could

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:10.000
go faster than light? No. There is one final
problem which is insurmountable which is that

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.609
a tether, like anything, is held together
by the electromagnetic interaction. That is,

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.230
the attractions between all the tiny little
charges that makeup the material. Now the

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.060
problem is, electromagnetism is a force carried
by photons. I mean, the way that something

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.250
knows that another thing is there to attract
it, is by the exchange of photons, these force

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.620
carrying particles. And the problem is the
photons themselves move at the speed of light.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.060
So even if you could create this incredible
apparatus with ridiculously strong materials

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.700
and spin it up with infinite energy, it still
wouldn’t go the speed of light, because

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.780
the force carrying particles that hold the
whole thing together only go the speed of

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.980
light.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.080
The speed of light really is the ultimate
speed limit in the universe.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.260
Hey, did you see that I made a video about
the problem with Facebook over on my second

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.090
channel? It really seems to have struck a
cord, so you should check it out if you haven’t

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.210
already.
Now I want to thank Audible for supporting

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.530
this episode of Veritasium. They are a leading
provider or audio books with over 150,000

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.610
titles in all areas of literature from fiction
to non fiction and periodicals. Now this week

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.840
I wanted to recommend the book by Bill Bryson
called A Brief History of Nearly Everything.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.330
When this book first came out I really wanted
to dislike it, because I felt like it was

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.640
just piggy backing on Stephen Hawking’s
Brief History of Time, but what Bill Bryson

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.070
has done is something truly different and
extraordinary. I really think it is a great

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.390
summary and a great sort of investigation
of what happens in science. It is a brilliant

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.390
thing to listen to.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:51.540
Also, if you go to Audible.com/Veritasium,
you can download this book for free, or another

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:57.080
of your choosing. Now they actually have this
book in an abridged form read by Bill Bryson

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.290
himself. It is really interesting to hear
the author’s voice. To me he sounds a little

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.660
bit like C. G. P. Gray, but with a hint of
a British accent. So you should really check

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.680
that out. Just go to Audible.com/Veritasium.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.210
All right. Thanks for watching and thanks
to Audible for supporting me.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.550
But there are some things which are going
faster than the speed of light, relative to

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.300
us. There are some distant galaxies which
are receding at a velocity than the light,

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.790
so we will never be able to see the light
that they emit.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.060
But this doesn’t violate Einstein’s theory
of relativity, because they are not moving

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.100
through space faster than light, it is just
that the space between us and them is expanding

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.990
so quickly that their effective velocity is
greater than the speed of light.
