00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.300
- [Derek] This is the world's
largest rainfall simulator,

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.223
located in Tsukuba, Japan.

00:00:06.377 --> 00:00:08.580
Now, I know that it just looks
like a warehouse with a lot

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.183
of sprinklers, but this building
is incredibly important.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.818
The science conducted here
keeps tens of millions

00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:21.213
of people safe, and it's only
becoming more and more vital.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.140
We were given exclusive
access to tour the facility,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.940
and they even let us
experience what it's like

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.310
to stand under the most intense rainfall

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.143
ever recorded.

00:00:30.143 --> 00:00:31.665
- [Petr] This is insane.

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:35.590
Nope, nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope, nope, nope.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.130
- Japan is a land of natural disasters.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.500
Most people will think
of earthquakes, tsunamis,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.430
and volcanoes, but it also
experiences massive typhoons,

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.720
which are like hurricanes

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.820
that pick up energy from the Pacific Ocean

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.703
and dump meters of rain on the islands.

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:55.020
Yakushima Island near the
southern part of Japan is one

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.420
of the wettest places on Earth,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.170
receiving up to 10 meters
of rain every year.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.900
For comparison, the Amazon
rainforest gets only

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.760
about three meters of rain per year.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.150
That's three times less
than Yakushima Island.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.670
Most of the time, rain isn't a problem.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.460
The water evaporates
or seeps into the soil

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.260
and is then absorbed by plants

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.140
or enters the underground aquifer systems.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.210
But too much rain in a short period,

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.410
like after a typhoon can
lead to serious problems.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.970
Problems that scientists working

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.300
at NIED use the rainfall
simulator to study

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.623
and hopefully prevent.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.200
The giant warehouse is equipped

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.320
with 550 nozzles attached to the roof.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.270
The scientists can control the intensity

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.850
of the rain from 15 millimeters per hour

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.850
to 300 millimeters per hour.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.610
The most rainfall ever
measured in one hour occurred

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.110
on the 22nd of June,
1947, when 305 millimeters

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.933
of rain fell on the
town of Holt, Missouri.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.760
So this warehouse can simulate
the most intense rainfall

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.860
anyone has ever experienced.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.430
In a way that makes it the
rainiest place on Earth.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.410
And honestly, I'm having a good time here

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.400
in sunny Australia.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.940
So I sent Veritasium
producer Petr in my stead.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.470
- They're gonna turn on
the rain really soon.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.470
So I'm running out to grab
my rain jacket, I'm ready.

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:24.180
Wow, this is so much rain.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.350
All around me, there is
exactly 300 millimeters

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.230
of rain falling every hour.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.960
We've only turned it on
about five minutes ago,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.820
and there's just so much rain.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.710
There's already puddles, this
is genuinely, absolutely wild.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.380
I don't think I've ever
experienced anything

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.790
like this before.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.250
- The nozzles at the
simulator contain four holes

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.010
of varying diameters, so
they can produce raindrops

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.100
of different sizes, and the
size of the raindrop affects

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.930
how fast it falls.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.850
You've likely experienced the kind of rain

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.040
with the big droplets that pelt your face

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.510
or walked through a drizzle

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.853
where small drops hover like mist.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.653
Because the smaller the
raindrop, the slower it falls.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.030
There are two forces
that act on a raindrop,

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.890
gravity and air resistance.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.690
And the larger raindrops
have a higher weight

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.190
to surface area ratio,

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.140
and so they have a
higher terminal velocity,

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.570
so they will be falling faster.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.090
A raindrop that's one
millimeter in diameter falls

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.520
at only about two meters per second,

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.560
while a three millimeter raindrop falls

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.441
at six meters per second.

00:03:33.441 --> 00:03:36.480
Air resistance is also why
raindrops aren't shaped

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.040
like cartoon raindrops.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.570
They are closer to spherical,

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.280
but a bit flatter on the bottom

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.440
where they encounter oncoming air.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.820
If a raindrop gets too big,

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.190
it flattens out, caves in in the middle

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.590
and briefly resembles a little parachute

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.293
before it breaks up into smaller droplets.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.810
Flooding is something that
Japan takes very seriously

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.250
and for good reason.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.490
In July, 2018, there were
floods all over the country

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.370
due to the rainfall
from Typhoon Prapiroon.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.010
Some regions of the country
received nearly two meters

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.990
of rain in just 10 days,

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.250
and the resulting floods were enough

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.900
that more than 8 million people had

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.720
to be evacuated from their homes.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.000
Over 200 people died,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.950
and the damage to property
from the flooding was more

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.833
than 1 trillion yen, nearly $10 billion.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.340
Tokyo, the capital city of Japan,

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.080
is very vulnerable to flooding.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.660
There are more than a hundred
rivers crisscrossing the city

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.850
of nearly 40 million people.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.250
To prevent the rivers from
overflowing, there are pipes

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.020
and tunnels under the city leading

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.930
to an enormous water storage tank.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.550
In October, 2019,

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.120
typhoon Hagibis dumped over
200 millimeters of rain

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.730
onto the city in under 48 hours.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.240
The underground system diverted
12 million cubic meters

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.953
of water and prevented an
estimated $1.7 billion in damage.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.240
But flooding isn't the only problem.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.240
Japan is a very mountainous
country with many towns

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.670
and villages situated in valleys.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.040
So combined with the heavy rainfall,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.353
this creates the perfect
conditions for another hazard.

00:05:29.152 --> 00:05:31.819
(man screaming)

00:05:41.329 --> 00:05:45.210
The researchers at NIED have
identified over 700,000 places

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.973
where landslides are a
significant threat to homes.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.750
But landslides are so complicated.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.220
There are so many factors

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.530
that affect if a landslide will occur,

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.930
how large it could be,
how fast it will move,

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.240
and how much damage it will do.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.420
Not just the slope angle
or the amount of new rain,

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.150
but the type of soil,
the minerals present,

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.943
and the vegetation growing
on top of the slope.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.670
This is footage from a landslide

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.370
that occurred in Norway in June of 2020.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.830
There's barely any slope angle here,

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.010
but the whole area sits
on a layer of quick clay,

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.890
an incredibly unstable clay
layer, which when exposed

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.980
to intense rainfall loses
its structural integrity,

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.570
becoming a liquid.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.450
In the case of this landslide,
there were no casualties,

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.390
though several homes
were swept out to sea.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.830
The complexity of the physics

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.720
of landslides is why the work done

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.173
at the large scale rainfall
simulator is so important.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.900
The best way to minimize
landslide damage is prevention,

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.540
and it's the same for cybersecurity.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.930
Creating strong passwords,
using anti-malware protection,

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.840
backing up your data and
updating your operating system

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.640
and software regularly.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.140
Something that's particularly useful

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.490
is a virtual private network
like today's sponsor, NordVPN.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.350
NordVPN hides your IP address

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.660
and helps protect your online identity.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.340
Petr filmed on location in Japan

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.850
and he used NordVPN to safely
access public wifi hotspots.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.770
And I am currently in Australia,

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.650
and I've been using
NordVPN to watch NHL games

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.660
'cause I think the
Canucks have a real shot

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.100
at the cup this year.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.650
Something I especially
like about NordVPN is

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.110
that their speeds are blisteringly fast.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.100
So it's effortless to just
keep it turned on all the time.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.500
High speeds are particularly
useful when you're connecting

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.880
to streaming services

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.761
and hopping on servers in distant
locations to watch content

00:07:35.761 --> 00:07:38.730
that's only available in those regions.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.350
For viewers of this channel,

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.650
use the link nordvpn.com/veritasium

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.140
for a huge discount on a two year plan,

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.870
plus an extra four months for free.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.150
So I'll put that link
down in the description.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.370
There's a 30 day money back guarantee,

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.170
so it's entirely risk free.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:58.830
Just go to nordvpn.com/veritasium.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.290
So I wanna thank NordVPN
for sponsoring this part

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:02.730
of the video, and now back

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.283
to the world's largest rainfall simulator.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.030
- All right, I'm gonna try
it without an umbrella.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.430
I have a very nice, very nice jacket.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:14.280
I'm not sure how it's gonna
hold up, but we're gonna try.

00:08:15.188 --> 00:08:17.820
(Petr screaming)

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.351
Oh my God, this is insane.

00:08:20.351 --> 00:08:23.370
Nope, nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope, nope, nope.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.010
My jacket is waterproof, so I was fine.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:30.000
But my jeans are
absolutely soaked through.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.200
- [Derek] To study landslides,

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.323
the whole warehouse
has a secret, it moves.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.750
- [Peter] The rainfall simulator can be

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.033
in one of five positions.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:47.870
- Velocity is about one
meter per one minute.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.400
- One meter per minute.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.220
Wow, it moves on these railway tracks.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.960
Every time you move it, you need

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.960
to grab this gigantic
wrench and undo these bolts.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:04.350
This is the pipe that connects

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.870
all the water up to the sprinklers.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.180
There's a number of these kind

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.300
of openings in the pipe along the line.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.530
So when you move it,

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.530
you just connect it to a different part.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.310
So this is the landslide testing facility?

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:25.230
- Yes, this is a 30 degree
slope, you can see this.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.630
This is a shallow landslide.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:32.630
Now you can put the soil
here, about one meter.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.470
- [Petr] You would put all
the sand and all the soil,

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.053
and then you'd bring the building over.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.273
You'd move it over here.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.970
And then you'd start raining on it.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:45.803
- Yes.

00:09:52.122 --> 00:09:54.540
- [Dr. Sakai] 20 degrees
this slope, is 20 degrees.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.107
- Right, so you have a 30, a 40, and a 20,

00:09:58.107 --> 00:10:00.150
20, 30, 40.
- Yes.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.850
- [Derek] So what causes landslides?

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.710
Well, a slope will slide when the force

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.110
of gravity pulling it down becomes greater

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.540
than the force of friction holding it up.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:10.830
- There's a misnomer out there

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:15.000
that water makes the materials
slipperier, so it rains

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.130
and it soaks into the ground
and it makes it slipperier.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.980
That's not true, water's
actually an anti lubricant

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.410
for many materials, including quartz,

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:27.333
which is our most common
mineral in soils and on earth.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.470
- [Derek] So water doesn't
make soil slipperier,

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.450
but soil is porous.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:37.200
There are grains and there are
pores between those grains.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.050
And as it rains, the
water seeps into the soil,

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.540
the pores become filled with water,

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.590
and as it keeps raining,

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.020
the water pressure in the pores increases,

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.530
which decreases the
friction between the grains.

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:52.290
For a slope that was
already at risk of sliding,

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.900
this decrease in friction
is what ultimately leads

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.753
to the slope breaking
apart and sliding downhill.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.220
- One thing that our
mathematical models are not

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.370
very well developed at yet is determining

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.640
is it going to slide slowly

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.800
or is it going to slide
or maybe flow rapidly?

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.300
That's a tough one, that's, so
experimentation's a great way

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.500
of getting at that.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.410
And you know, the scaler effects are huge.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:22.080
So many people have a
little model in their lab,

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.270
you know, a small scale flume,

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.067
but now you're dealing
with materials, you know,

00:11:26.067 --> 00:11:28.650
you're starting to get off scale.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.490
A large scale stimulation
device like they have in Japan

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:34.023
is really important.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.383
- [Derek] So how can
you prevent landslides?

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:40.380
Well, there are a few things you can do,

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.560
like using steel beams and
mesh to anchor the slope.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.750
Or you can dig up the
top layer of the soil

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.760
to decrease the slope angle.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.650
And when it's expected
that a slope will slide

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:52.710
after too much rain, engineers
drill holes into the slope

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.980
and place pipes to drain the water out.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.470
Another solution is to
create catchment zones

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:01.140
and diversion channels,
big holes in the ground

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.940
that will catch or divert the landslide

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.850
before it hits a residential area.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.940
Trees are incredibly effective
at preventing landslides.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.490
Not only do their roots
provide great anchors,

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:15.390
they draw the water up from
the soil to be evaporated away,

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:16.890
which effectively drains the soil

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.743
and decreases the water level.

00:12:20.458 --> 00:12:23.541
(chainsaw operating)

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:30.870
Where steep slopes have been deforested

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:34.290
for the timber industry,
landslides have become more common.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:35.490
Over the last few decades,

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:38.310
there has been a tenfold
increase in landslides

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.060
in the forests of British Columbia.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.190
- Humans are really good
at causing landslides

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:45.570
and we're shaping the land a heck

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:48.480
of a lot more quickly than
geologic processes do.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.200
So when we excavate over
here or add more weight

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.380
or more landslide or
more material over here,

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.680
and that triggers landslides
very, very regularly.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.280
Study in Seattle from Seattle,
Washington a few decades ago,

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.709
showed that I think more than 85%

00:13:04.709 --> 00:13:09.709
had at least partial human
trigger, if you will.

00:13:14.717 --> 00:13:16.053
- [Derek] While the focus
of the work is primarily

00:13:16.053 --> 00:13:18.360
on landslide study and prevention,

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.190
the simulator is also used to test

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.343
how drones fly in rainy
and windy conditions.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.570
It's also used to test self-driving cars.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.580
The data is used to improve the hardware

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:33.030
and software of how the
cars detect various objects.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:36.060
The two main ways that self-driving
cars detect other cars,

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.850
traffic lights and
pedestrians is with cameras

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:40.680
or LIDAR sensors.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.470
In both cases, rain can
decrease the visibility

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.690
and accuracy of these sensors.

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:48.480
So testing them in a perfectly
repeatable environment

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.520
helps engineers develop solutions

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.143
to these weather challenges.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.600
- In Japan, the rainfall
condition is changing.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.760
And now in this century,

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.540
the rainfall condition
is so many heavy rainfall

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:07.160
in so much short time.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.720
- [Derek] As the world heats
up due to humanity's addiction

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.680
to fossil fuels,

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.320
extreme weather events
are becoming more common.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.230
Compared to 30 years ago, the
number of rain events in Japan

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.870
with an intensity of
50 millimeters per hour

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.300
have become 40% more common.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.500
Rainfall at double

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.740
that intensity has become 70% more common.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.050
Climate change will increase
the rate of flooding

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:30.360
and the occurrence of
landslides in the future,

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.410
which is why the work done

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:34.470
at the world's largest rainfall
simulator is becoming more

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.000
and more important.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.190
But I hope that humanity
focuses its efforts

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:40.950
on addressing the root
causes of climate change

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.223
and not just on the mitigation
of its negative impacts.
