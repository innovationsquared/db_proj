00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.310
Welcome to beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.430
This is actually where I grew up, just across
that water.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.079
And I remember when I was a teenager here
I wanted to be a film maker.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.379
And so what did I do?

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:20.310
Well, I found a film director with a strange
name who lived in Vancouver.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.220
I saw her on the cover of this magazine and
then I just looked up her number in the phone

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.109
book, in the white pages, because that is
how you did back in the year 2000.

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.440
And I gave her a call and she said she was
on the other line, but she would call me back.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.420
And, strangely enough, she did call me back.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.809
And it was amazing.

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.870
I got to chat to her about film making.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.340
I guess what I really wanted was for someone
else to be able to provide me with an opportunity

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.680
to get on set, to get some experience in that
industry and show me what it is like.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.059
I just want to know and it is so hard when
you are on the outside to figure out how to

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.059
break in.

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.420
You just want to reach out to someone who
knows and say: Help me with this.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.680
There is a psychological phenomenon known
as learned helplessness.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.410
And the experiments conducted way back decades
ago that established this phenomenon were

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.490
really quite terrible.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.920
What they would do is take dogs and for some
of them, at least, they would force them to

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.670
endure a punishment.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.670
For example, they would receive electric shocks
and there was nothing they could do to prevent

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.670
those shocks.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.080
For other dogs there were actually little
levers or a fence they could hop over that

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.610
would stop the shocks.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.830
Now later on they took all of those dogs and
they tested them again, but in environments

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.460
where every one of those dogs had the opportunity
to avoid the shocks by taking some action.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.490
Now what was found was those dogs that had
been forced to endure the shocks and had no

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.940
way of stopping them just kind of came to
accept the shocks even when there were actions

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.540
that they could take which would stop them.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.070
So this is learned helplessness.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.090
They have learned that there is nothing they
can do to stop that uncomfortable situation.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.300
There is a related study carried out with
adults where they were trying to complete

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.000
a task, except there was this distracting
noise playing.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.780
Now some of the adults had the ability to
turn off that noise, whereas others did not.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.590
It was not under their control.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.090
And when you look at the performance, the
adults who had the control to turn off the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.920
noise performed better even when they didn’t
actually exercise that control.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.599
So they just let the noise play, but the knowledge
that they could shut it off if they wanted

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.000
to, made them perform better.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.709
I have worked at many jobs now, some very
menial and some more managerial or entrepreneurial

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.650
like I was basically running the show.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.189
And what I found is that there is kind of
this divide between employees and managers.

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:46.079
When you are an employee and you are assigned
to do something, you try to do it as best

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.310
you have been shown, but if you hit a roadblock
you kind of stop and you go to your manager

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.069
or supervisor and you say: Hey, what do I
do now?

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.230
I have done that before.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.049
I have done it when I was a research assistant.

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.049
I would get some result.

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.180
I didn’t really know what was going on.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.340
And I would just take it to my supervisor.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.780
The supervisor would say: Oh, well, why don’t
you try this?

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.859
And that suggestion that they made was always
one that I knew or, you know, I could have

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.829
thought of if I had just spent five minutes
on it or if I really wanted to achieve that

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:14.829
goal.

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:20.159
But instead, I just had this mentality like:
I am carrying out this task and when I get

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:21.420
stuck, I am just going to ask someone else.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.609
You know, there is a story that Tim Ferriss
tells.

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.079
He is the guy who wrote The Four Hour Work
Week which is a book I would recommend.

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:32.549
But he went and visited this university and
he challenged the students that he was talking

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:33.549
to.

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.599
He said: Look, I will give you 25,000 dollars
and a trip around the world for anyone who

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:44.150
shows that they have made contact, by some
sort of signature or email, a letter or something,

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.680
with either Jennifer Lopez, Bill Clinton—who
I think at the time was the President, possibly—and

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.389
J.D. Salinger, who is the most reclusive writer
of all time.

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.450
And did anyone do it?

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.629
No.

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:58.959
Not a one.

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.590
Now the following year he went back to the
same university and in addition to making

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.810
the challenge he told them the story from
the previous year, that no one had actually

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.310
done it, no one had really tried.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.090
And that year six people actually achieved
his challenge.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.520
The point being, you need to find a way around
the learned helplessness mentality, the employee

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.980
mentality and find a way to realize that things
that seem impossible can be accomplished if

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.990
you really accept that you have control of
these things, that it is not outside of your

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.990
control.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.960
It may be a question we should ask is: Does
our school system promote learned helplessness?

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.700
Do we force kids to suffer punishments that
they really can’t change time and time and

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.570
time again and then we expose them to a world
and say: Now you go out and do what you want

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.780
to do?

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.770
I think to a certain degree we are doing that.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:05.340
You know, school is for a lot of kids just
a weird and unusual kind of punishment and

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.980
I guess it is no wonder that they learn that,
you know, there is things beyond their control,

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:14.340
because school is kind of about taking control
away from kids.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.830
You know, for the dogs.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.930
How did they get the dogs to overcome their
learned helplessness and actually get away

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.750
from the shocks they were receiving?

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.180
They tried treats and encouragements, but
it didn’t work.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.090
They had to physically move the dogs away
from the area where they were being shocked

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:36.410
at least twice before they would actually
learn that they had the power to change their

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.750
faith, that they didn’t have to suffer that
kind of punishment again and again.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:48.570
But with you, I feel like just letting you
know that this thing exists might be enough

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.590
to change the way you view your life and your
opportunities.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.890
Let’s talk briefly about career paths.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.250
I applied to acting school three times and
was rejected three times.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.710
I applied to film school twice and was rejected
twice.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.140
I think what I was looking for out of those
institutions was a sure fire way to get to

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.710
the career that I wanted.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.810
I was basically doing the same thing that
I was doing when I asked that director in

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.380
Vancouver to help me out, to get me on set.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.040
I was asking for someone else to make this
possible for me.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.470
I mean, there is a small number of jobs where
the career path is clearly laid out.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.270
You want to be a doctor, you have to go to
med school.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.440
You want to be a lawyer, you have to go to
law school.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.090
You want to be an academic, you have to do
a PhD.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.750
But I think there is a much larger group of
careers where you really have to figure out

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.880
a way to do it yourself.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.120
And that is the whole point.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.260
That is the whole challenge.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.470
You feel like you are not in control and you
want someone else to help you get that control

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.820
or get in the place where you need to be,
but no one can really help you.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.280
Just like that director couldn’t really
help me get where I need to be, I cannot help

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.440
other people get where they need to be.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.360
You really have it all up to you.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.850
I mean, you have to demonstrate that you can
do what you want to do.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.320
You know, there is this quote.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.010
Grant me the serenity to accept the things
I cannot change and the courage to change

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.200
the things I can and the wisdom to know the
difference.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:27.090
Now my point is: When you are contemplating
the things that you can and cannot change,

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:36.880
ere on the side of thinking that you can change
much more than you can, because often you

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.970
will be able to.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:43.620
I mean, everything seems impossible until
it is done.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:49.380
That is a Nelson Mandela quote, which I think
is kind of appropriate in this circumstance.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.350
Things look a lot more impossible than they
are.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:59.990
And, really, it is up to you to find out.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:08.750
Hey, as you can tell, books have had a huge
impact on my life and how I see the world.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.940
And when I am traveling I like to listen to
them as audio books, because it is just more

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.000
convenient on planes and trains.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.760
And there is actually one I wanted to recommend
to you.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.410
It is called Predictably Irrational by Dan
Ariely.

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:23.700
It is about how humans don’t really behave
rationally even when we think that is what

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:24.700
we are doing.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.410
So it provides pretty good insight into how
your brain works and how the brains of everyone

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.460
around you work.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:33.579
And if you want, you can download this book
for free by going to Audible.com/Veritasium

00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:37.199
or you can pick any other book of your choosing
for a one month free trial.

00:08:37.199 --> 00:08:41.709
Audible is a great audio book website with
over 180,000 titles in all areas of literature

00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:44.360
including fiction, non fiction and periodicals.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.830
So you should definitely check them out.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.339
I want to thank Audible for supporting me
and I want to thank you for watching.
