00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.940
Boiling point is something that we normally think of as a stable property of a substance.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.000
But it really depends on what the pressure is around the substance,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.040
so, for example, water only boils at 100 degrees Celsius, if the pressure is 1 atmosphere.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.520
So if you reduce the pressure, then those water molecules that are going quite quickly

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.140
can easily escape from the water if there's no pressure pushing down on them.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.440
So you can get water to boil at room temperature.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.500
This is really boiling water.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.360
The funny thing about boiling water at room temperature

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.480
is that it actually decreases the temperature of the water.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.120
That's because all the fastest water molecules escape,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.140
leaving only the slow ones behind.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.140
We are refrigerating the water

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.460
Refrigerating the water, by boiling it.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.440
Yes, yes

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.060
(Laughing)

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.540
That is a cool concept.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.340
I know everyone's a big fan of liquid nitrogen, but I've never seen solid nitrogen.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.900
So we used the same trick, pumping out the very fastest nitrogen molecules.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.580
And eventually, that decreased the temperature enough that the nitrogen actually froze.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:06.360
(Laughing)

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.260
I'm putting a thermocouple in there so we can measure the temperature of our liquid nitrogen.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
And it reads...

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.740
Okay, so the temperature of our liquid nitrogen is about minus 196 Celsius.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.160
Which is exactly what it should be.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.100
And now we're going to evacuate the chamber.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.100
We're gonna suck the air out of there.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.940
you can see that the nitrogen is boiling

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.000
The temperature's dropping, minus 199, minus 200...

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We're coming up on the triple point of nitrogen.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.020
I don't know.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.280
We're forming solid nitrogen.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.580
The ice is actually getting sucked up by the reduced pressure up here,

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.380
and there is a higher pressure underneath the ice because the vacuum pump hasn't had a chance to work there.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.220
I've never seen solid nitrogen before

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.920
After creating the solid nitrogen,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.080
we poured it onto a water bath.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.720
and we got the whole surface so cold that carbon dioxide actually condensed out of the atmosphere,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.260
and we formed solid carbon dioxide, dry ice, on the surface of the water.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.340
we have a solid piece of CO2
