00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.870
I'll explain more at the end, but let me set up this clip in five words:

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.960
robot killers, Stephen Fry,

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:09.689
watch

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.979
Autonomous weapons have been described as the third revolution in warfare

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.459
after gunpowder and nuclear bombs.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.350
They could mount rapid devastating attacks on a huge scale.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:31.230
Thousands of experts including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking have signed an open letter calling for a ban on the weapons.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.380
They say drones that can autonomously find and eliminate people meeting certain criteria

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.310
are feasible within years, not decades

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.820
But calls for a ban have been rejected by the world's 10 largest military powers

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.980
and Musk has warned that international competition for AI superiority

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.700
is the most likely cause of World War 3

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.960
So, do we have a recipe for disaster?

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.020
Let's start with the current situation

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.860
During Obama's presidency the number of American troops in war zones dropped by around 90 percent

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.620
But there were ten times more drone strikes

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.100
Russia has multiple unmanned drone tanks in development

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.700
and completely autonomous armed vehicles guarding missile bases

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.960
America plans to enable its Abrams tanks to control robotic wingman vehicles

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.240
to attack the enemy while protecting the manned tank

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.520
It is also considering a remote-controlled version of the high speed ripsaw vehicle

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.960
Air power is already used with relative impunity

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.200
And soon the fighters will use AI to control drone wingmen able to carry weapons

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.069
test air defenses and keep human pilots even further from danger

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.690
Around the world

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.690
anti-ballistic missile defenses and drones are diminishing nuclear deterrence

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.680
This is the US Navy's new unmanned ship designed to hunt submarines and launch surface weapons

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.800
It will cost around 20 thousand dollars per day to operate

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.680
compared to 700 thousand dollars per day for a manned destroyer

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.820
In a simulation test with the Air Force Research Lab AI drones repeatedly defeated a human pilot

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.840
Former Air Force battle manager Jean Lee tried and failed to hit the drones

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.420
and was destroyed by them every time

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.140
He said they seemed to be aware of his intention

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.060
and reacted instantly to his movements and attacks

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.540
Autonomous weapons would be cheap to mass-produce

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.080
and may become available to terrorists and dictators on the black market

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:11.340
A recent report by the US defense Science Board called for immediate action to accelerate military AI development

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.680
and understand the capabilities of other powers

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.340
It also noted that commercial drones are rapidly improving

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.620
and private AI firms are well ahead of the military

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.980
Some argue AI will reduce accidental casualties by making fewer mistakes

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.860
If a soldier believes someone is a threat

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.880
their life depends on making a quick decision

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:43.820
A robot on the other hand could react a fraction of a second before it's fired on or even wait until it's attacked

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:51.280
But the weapons could also be extremely effective at assassinations, subduing populations

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.500
and selectively killing particular ethnic groups

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:03.320
The second revolution in warfare brought the world close to World War 3 with the Cuban Missile Crisis

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.220
The third revolution may be even more volatile

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.780
We also need to plan for an even greater threat from AI itself

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.580
Many experts believe it will surpass human intelligence in the next few decades

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.840
It may then assume full control of the world's networked weapons

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.400
Would it use them for peacekeeping?

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.260
Or for bringing humanity to a quick end?

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:38.920
Whether or not humans retain control and AI arms race may be a race to Armageddon

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.720
We believe a ban that's difficult to enforce is better than a world flooded

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.560
with cheap anonymous autonomous weapons

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.500
What do you think?

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.120
So I hope you enjoyed that clip or were frightened by it

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.660
Let me know what you thought in the comments below

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.230
That clip was actually made by friends of mine who run a YouTube channel called Pindex

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.700
They make incredibly high quality educational videos

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.900
If you want to check them out, I will put a link in the description and one up here

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.760
Now, you know whenever I see those Boston Dynamics videos come out

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.220
I'm always simultaneously amazed

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.300
at the achievements that they've been able to produce

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:38.740
and simultaneously scared that I'm watching the birth of the ancestors of our future robot overlords

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.640
So, yeah, I've got mixed feelings about this

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.040
but I think it's a really important topic and that's why I wanted to share this clip with you

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:51.540
And I also wanted to highlight the fine work of the guys over at Pindex, so yeah, definitely check them out

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.020
and for those of you who are asking

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.530
Derrick what about your videos? Why haven't you been posting very much lately?

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.380
Well, I have been working on some stuff

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.730
In fact, I've got a full-length 90-minute documentary coming out in the summer of this year

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.020
It'll be available globally

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.700
so watch out for that. I will be giving you some updates closer to the day

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.820
And I also have a pilot for a brand new series

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.140
that I worked on with minutephysics and MinuteEarth, I will put a link in the description

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.920
And if you're in the U.S., you can go check it out. Other places are geo-blocked

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.510
You know I can't

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.550
say anything for that

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.580
but it's our intention to try to get this series out to as many people around the world as we possibly can

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:36.060
So if you can check it out, go and do that now and I will be posting some more videos soon

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.140
I promise and hopefully it will

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:45.160
explain why I've been absent for some of this time, so yeah. I hope you enjoyed that clip
