00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.480
These are tiny molecular machines, and they are doing this inside your body - right now.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.800
To understand why, we have to zoom out.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.560
Every day, in an adult human body, 50 to 70 billion of your cells die.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.860
Either they're stressed, or damaged, or just old. But this is normal - in fact, it's called "programmed cell death".

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.680
But, to make up for all these lost cells, right now, billions of your cells are dividing,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.520
essentially creating new cells. And that process of cell division, also called mitosis --

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.180
well, it requires an army of tiny molecular machines. So, let's take a closer look.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.400
DNA is a good place to start - the double helix molecule we always talk about.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.540
This is a scientifically accurate depiction of DNA, created by Drew Berry

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.780
at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.180
If you unwind the two strands, you can see that each has a sugar-phosphate backbone

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.660
connected to the sequence of nucleic acid base pairs, known by the letters A, T, G and C.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.660
Now, the strands run in opposite directions, which is important when you go to copy DNA.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.900
Copying DNA is one of the first steps in cell division.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.540
Here,  the two strands of DNA are being unwound and separated

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.760
by the tiny blue molecular machine called "helicase".

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.060
Helicase literally spins as fast as a jet engine!

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.300
The strand of DNA on the right has its complementary strand assembled continuously.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.620
But the other strand is more complicated, because it runs in the opposite direction.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.860
So it must be looped out with its complementary strand assembled in reverse, section by section.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.620
At the end of this process, you have two identical DNA molecules, each one a few centimeters long,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.020
but just a couple nanometers wide.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.180
So, to prevent the DNA from becoming a tangled mess, it is wrapped around proteins called "histones",

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.820
forming a nucleosome.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.820
These nucleosomes are bundled together into a fiber known as chromatin, which is further looped and coiled

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.280
to form a chromosome, one of the largest molecular structures in your body.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.180
You can actually see chromosomes under a microscope in dividing cells.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.980
Only then do they take on their characteristic shape. Otherwise, the DNA is more strewn inside the nucleus.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.660
The process of dividing a cell takes around an hour in mammals, so this footage is from a time-lapse.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.540
You can see how the chromosomes line up on the equator of the cell.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.580
Now, when everything is right, they are pulled apart into the two new daughter cells,

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.800
each one containing an identical copy of DNA.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.420
Now, simple as this looks, the process is incredibly complicated and requires

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.900
even more fascinating molecular machines to accomplish it.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.600
So, let's look at a single chromosome.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.020
One chromosome consists of two sausage shaped chromatids, containing

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.540
the identical copies of DNA made earlier.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.380
Each chromatid is attached to microtubule fibers, which guide and help align them in the correct position.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.600
The microtubules are connected to the chromatid at the kinetochore, here colored red.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.660
The kinetochore consists of hundreds of different proteins working together to achieve multiple

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.740
objectives. In fact, it's one of the most sophisticated molecular mechanisms inside your body.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.920
The kinetochore is central to the successful separation of the chromatids. It creates a dynamic

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.140
connection between the chromosome and the microtubules.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.380
For a reason no one's yet been able to figure out, the microtubules are constantly being built at one end

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.380
and deconstructed at the other.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.500
While the chromosome is still getting ready, the kinetochore sends out a chemical "stop" signal

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.440
to the rest of the cell, shown here by the red molecules,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.180
basically saying, "this chromosome is not yet ready to divide."

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.620
The kinetochore also mechanically senses tension.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.980
When the tension is just right, and the position and attachment are correct,

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.280
all the proteins get ready, shown here by turning green.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.540
At this point, the stop signal broadcasting system is not switched off!

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.500
Instead, it is literally carried away from the kinetochore, down the microtubules,

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.620
by a dynein motor - that's the walking guy.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:50.940
This is really what it looks like: it has long "legs" so it can avoid obstacles and step over the kinesins,

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.940
molecular motors that walk in the opposite direction.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.280
Personally, I'm astounded by these tiny molecular machines, how they're able to

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:07.340
routinely and faithfully execute their functions billions of times over inside your body at this exact instant.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.240
I'm also amazed by the scientists who were able to work out how this happens

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.300
in such detail that we could create realistic depictions of them, like you saw in the animations in this video.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.160
But, perhaps, the most amazing thing is just how much is left to be discovered, like,

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.520
figuring out how exactly the chromatids are pulled to opposite ends of the cell.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.660
There is still so much that we don't quite know.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.320
You know, what I find exciting is, that in science fiction, for decades,

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.580
we've been writing about tiny nanobots that will be injected into our blood streams that can heal us.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.300
But, what this suggests, the existence of these tiny molecular machines inside us,

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:50.089
it suggests that there isn't a physical limit that would prevent that. And so, I think it's pretty likely that, in future,

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:53.880
we will be able to develop our own tiny molecular machines

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.180
that will be able to repair our bodies better than they can repair themselves.
