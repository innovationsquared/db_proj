00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.940
- This is the world's
largest earthquake simulator.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.280
It's called E-Defense.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.540
Its huge shake table can
support a 10-story building

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.670
and then move it in all directions

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.123
with the force of the world's
most destructive earthquakes.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.290
E-Defense has conducted
more than a hundred tests,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.630
subjecting all kinds of buildings

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.360
to different simulated earthquakes,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.220
all to learn how to make buildings

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.693
more earthquake-resistant.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.270
Part of this video was
brought to you by Shopify,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.313
more about them later in the video.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.182
On the 17th of January, 1995

00:00:42.182 --> 00:00:45.150
at 5:46 in the morning,
an earthquake struck

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.430
the city of Kobe Japan.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.043
It took everyone by surprise.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.050
Japan is one of the most
seismically active countries

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.883
in the world.

00:00:58.883 --> 00:01:01.470
It sits on the boundary
of four tectonic plates

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.750
and 90% of all earthquakes,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.700
and almost all of the powerful ones

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.193
happen at tectonic plate boundaries.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.193
But Kobe isn't near one.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.000
This earthquake was caused
by an interplate fault,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.610
essentially a crack in the Earth's surface

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.640
that isn't at the boundary
of a tectonic plate.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.680
This fault hadn't produced any earthquakes

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.500
for around a thousand years,

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.813
so the city was completely unprepared.

00:01:28.813 --> 00:01:33.300
(woman speaking in Japanese)

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.390
The quake measured a magnitude 6.9

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.660
just under the definition
of a major earthquake.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.350
Despite this, the earthquake
killed more than 6,000 people

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.680
and left another 300,000 homeless.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.650
More than 80% of the
fatalities were caused

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.780
by the collapse of buildings.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.880
The total economic cost was estimated

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.850
at 80 billion US dollars.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.980
In response, the government
gathered scientists

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.920
for a conference on earthquake
disaster prevention,

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.030
and there they agreed

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.460
to build the largest earthquake simulator

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.680
the world had ever seen.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.860
So I sent Petr to Japan
for an exclusive look

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.093
inside this facility.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.470
- So we're entering the world's
biggest earthquake simulator

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.170
as they're about to do an experiment.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.043
So let's go.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.760
Right now there's eight concrete walls

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.040
that they're gonna feed seismic signals

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.360
into the shake table,

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.400
and they're gonna see which
ones are the most sturdy.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.410
So the seismic data that
they're gonna feed in

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.420
is from the El Centro earthquake,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.590
which was an earthquake

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.810
that happened on the 18th of May, 1940.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.790
It was a 6.9 magnitude earthquake,

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.170
and it's one of the first ones

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.243
that we actually have seismic data from.

00:02:44.186 --> 00:02:45.543
Oh.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.800
Okay, things are wow, wow,
wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.707
Oh, oh.

00:02:55.521 --> 00:02:56.479
Okay.

00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:00.570
It is just really cool to
see such a big structure

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.360
kind of moving that far and that fast.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.950
Wow.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.073
The first test that I actually saw,

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.700
it was on the schedule
and it said white noise.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.880
- So the white noise is just
all different frequencies,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.744
low frequencies, high frequencies,
everything in between.

00:03:17.744 --> 00:03:18.577
- Yeah.

00:03:18.577 --> 00:03:19.530
They make this big deal.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.970
They're like, oh, one minute,

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.673
like, and then they do like
the 10 second countdown.

00:03:25.655 --> 00:03:27.243
Three, two, one.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.783
And then it's just like
functionally nothing.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.880
We flew all the way to
Japan to to see this,

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.290
so let's hope at least one wall falls down

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.113
and I couldn't figure
out why for a long time.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.460
- All the structure has natural frequency.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.860
When the structure is damaged,

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.920
natural frequency becomes shorter.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.240
So by inputting white noise
with components of wide range

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.810
of frequency, so we can
find natural frequency

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.600
of building.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.520
So first, input white noise fast,

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.310
and after that input as quick motion,

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.030
and then we we usually
input another white noise

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.483
so we can find a change
of natural frequency.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.150
- [Derek] At the center of E-Defense

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.820
is a 20 meter by 15 meter shake table,

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.430
which weighs 800 tons.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.860
On each side there are
five hydraulic actuators,

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.020
which push the table side to side,

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.370
and the whole thing is supported

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.070
by another 14 actuators at the bottom,

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.620
which moved the table up and down.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.260
The whole facility is massive.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.080
There is one warehouse where
the shake table is housed,

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.790
but it's in such high demand

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.560
that all the buildings are constructed

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.070
in a separate warehouse and
then transferred across.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.160
Then there is a whole
area full of giant engines

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.580
and nitrogen storage tanks
just to power the shake table.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.413
- [Petr] Oh my God.

00:04:57.413 --> 00:04:59.070
This is a huge engine.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.000
- [Derek] Using this setup,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.740
the scientists can perfectly simulate

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.120
past earthquakes and determine

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.370
their effects on different buildings.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.300
The shake table can hold
masses up to 1200 tons

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.890
and jolt them with accelerations

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.590
up to 15 meters per second squared.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.993
That's over one 1.5 gs.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.480
Now, I know jet fighters can
pull like 10 gs as they turn,

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.980
but it's another story

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.620
if you're in your house and
the floor starts accelerating

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.333
faster than a falling object.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.170
The goal of the shake table

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.810
is to realistically simulate earthquakes.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.090
To do this, you need two things.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.190
A way of being able to apply enough force

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.580
in a precise and controlled
way, and the signal data

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.680
from real earthquakes.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.793
This is how they do it.

00:05:45.793 --> 00:05:49.380
- Are you okay at high elevation place?

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.230
- Let's see.
(both laughing)

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.640
- This one is actuator.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.280
- The actuators themselves are hydraulic.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.130
Inside each one, there's a 30 ton piston

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.380
driven by high pressure oil.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.940
- This is massive.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.920
This is, I don't know, a meter,

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.110
meter and a half in diameter.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.610
- [Derek] But to generate
the pressure needed

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.050
to operate the shake table

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.180
and sustain it for minutes at a time,

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.870
E-Defense needs huge
reserves of pressure storage.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.880
That's why there's a whole
section of the warehouse

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.390
with massive high pressure
storage tanks full of nitrogen.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:26.390
- We have 20 of these lead
spherical shaped accumulators,

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.410
so we accumulate the pressure.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.750
- To pressurize these
tanks liquid nitrogen

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.900
is pumped in from a large
storage tank outside,

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.750
and as that liquid warms
up, it turns into a gas

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.040
and expands 694 times its original volume.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.300
It's relatively easy

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.150
to obtain very high
pressures with nitrogen.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:49.620
Then when the pressure is needed,

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.250
it's transferred to the oil
using a bunch of pistons.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.250
As the test runs, the oil
is pumped to the actuators

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.080
by these giant engines,

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.150
but even they can't
sustain the pressure needed

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.490
to operate the shake table for very long.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.710
And so the nitrogen pressure reserves mean

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:05.880
that the shake table can deliver

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.530
a consistent amount of force

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.813
from the start of the
test right to the end.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.970
While a test is run, the
pressurized oil needs to be pumped

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.950
to the actuators by the engines.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.140
The flow to each actuator is controlled

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.500
by electronic servo valves,
meaning precisely timed

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.330
and measured forces can be applied

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.210
to the table to match any earthquake.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.480
Now, because the actuators can
only move in one dimension,

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.700
if they were fixed directly to the table,

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.460
there would be no flexibility
and they would break.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.280
And so the engineers at
E-Defense designed bespoke

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.230
seven meter long universal joints

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.230
to transfer the force from the
actuators to the shake table.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.680
To simulate real earthquakes.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.720
The shaking can't be random.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.370
I mean, each earthquake has its own

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.320
characteristic pattern of movement,

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.080
which can be recorded using a seismometer.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.140
Early seismometers were
basically just a pen attached

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:02.250
to some springs, drawing a line
over a moving roll of paper.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.200
And when there was an
earthquake, the pen would shake

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.560
and draw out the pattern of
acceleration of that earthquake.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.390
The trace that was seen on the paper

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.940
is known as a seismograph.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.250
Nowadays we use geophones.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.740
A geophone is made from
a coil of wire suspended

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.560
around a magnet all
held together by springs

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.690
when the ground shakes, the springs shake,

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.300
causing the wire to move up
and down over the magnet,

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.040
which generates a current.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.160
This current is recorded
to produce a seismograph

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.090
to get the full picture

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.640
of how the earth's surface
moves in all three dimensions,

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.350
three geophones are needed,

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:37.083
one oriented in each orthogonal direction.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.290
The strength of an earthquake is measured

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:41.820
on the magnitude scale.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.930
The smallest earthquake

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:46.530
that humans can feel is about
a billion times less powerful

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.170
than the biggest earthquake ever recorded.

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.260
Because of this, the magnitude
scale is logarithmic.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.840
An increase of one on the
magnitude scale represents

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.993
a tenfold increase in the
force of the earthquake.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.440
An earthquake under 2.5
on the magnitude scale

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.450
is imperceptible to humans.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.910
These happen millions of times every year,

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.640
but can only be detected by geophones.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.100
Earthquakes higher than
six on the magnitude scale

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.280
can damage buildings, but
occur far less frequently,

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.133
only a few hundred times a year globally.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.100
The most powerful earthquake ever recorded

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.650
was the great Chilean earthquake of 1960,

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.980
which measured 9.5 on the magnitude scale.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.980
It killed somewhere
between 1 and 6,000 people

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.450
and caused more than 400 million
US dollars worth of damage.

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.340
But how destructive an earthquake is

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.470
isn't just determined by the magnitude.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.263
It also matters how
close the epicenter is.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.580
- Behind me is what was until 2022

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.070
the world's longest suspension bridge.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.800
The Akashi Kaikyo Bridge connects Honshu,

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.830
the main island of Japan to Awaji Island

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.290
nearly four kilometers away.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.390
The center span the distance

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:02.390
between the two towers is 1,990
meters and 80 centimeters.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.670
I'm here because a few
kilometers that way,

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:09.330
and 16 kilometers
underground was the epicenter

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:13.770
for the Great Hanshin earthquake of 1995.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.030
As the earthquake struck,

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.820
the bridge was still under construction.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.310
And despite being right
above the epicenter,

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:23.310
there was no major
damage to the structure.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.520
But the earth underneath
the bridge had moved,

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.670
and the original plans
would no longer work.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.190
The plans would need to be modified.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:35.520
So that's how the world's
longest suspension bridge

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.073
became 80 centimeters longer.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.850
- [Derek] After E-Defense opened in 2005,

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.830
one of their first tests was a comparison

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:50.070
between two traditional
Japanese wooden houses.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:53.850
The houses were transported
from the nearby city of Akashi.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.500
They were rebuilt on the table

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.173
and shaken at the magnitude
of the Kobe earthquake.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:06.780
The house that stayed up

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.030
had been retrofitted with wooden braces,

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:13.050
beams, and metal joints making
it more earthquake resistant.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.780
The other was unmodified.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.540
This test demonstrated
that older Japanese houses

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.123
are not able to withstand
powerful earthquakes.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.943
It also presented a solution.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.970
Some relatively simple

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:28.950
and inexpensive structural reinforcement

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.073
can significantly increase
earthquake resistance.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.807
- In 1981, the Japanese
government introduces

00:11:36.807 --> 00:11:40.560
like all these new building
codes for new houses, right?

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.810
And they're like, you need
this kind of seismic dampening,

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.100
you need these isolation things.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.900
You need these like wooden beams.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:50.900
All of the buildings that
were built post 1981 in Kobe

00:11:52.007 --> 00:11:57.007
0.3% of them collapsed
during this earthquake.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.840
Of the ones that didn't, 8.4%,

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.310
like about a 30 time difference

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:06.243
between new houses and old houses, right?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.290
This is kind of like weird thing,

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:15.663
like I was there on day one, you know,

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.810
watching like the shake table work,

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:20.880
and I'm just kind of like looking around

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.410
this entire, like this giant warehouse,

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.870
and I see this section
where it's just like,

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:27.240
what looks like IKEA furniture?

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.487
Can you tell me what this is for?

00:12:29.487 --> 00:12:32.490
- To see the, you know, in room safety,

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:37.030
yeah, we place lots of furniture
in the structured specimen.

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.630
- A lot of the injuries, right,

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.390
that happen in earthquakes
is from stuff falling

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:43.223
on top of you.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.040
A cabinet falling over
and hitting your head,

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.390
or, you know, you being crushed

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.140
by a fridge or something like that.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.510
Half of the injuries that were sustained

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.070
indoors in Kobe were from,

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.410
you know, furniture
falling on top of people.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.870
So one of the things that
E-Defenses does is like,

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.190
how do you make sure
buildings don't collapse,

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:06.240
but it's also how do you make sure

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.643
that the insides of the
buildings are also safe?

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.770
- This part of the video was
brought to you by Shopify.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.980
You know, back in 2015,
I came up with Snatoms,

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.870
a better way of modeling molecules,

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.230
and I've been using Shopify
to sell Snatoms ever since.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:26.910
And over those last eight years,

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.610
I found Shopify really easy to work with.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.860
They offer an all-in-one commerce platform

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.800
that anyone can use to sell
products, manage inventory,

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.300
or grow their business.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.920
One of my favorite things about Shopify

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.170
is the depth of data that they provide.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.180
You can see real-time data

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.360
on how many people are on
your site at any given time

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.550
and how many are checking out.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:48.660
Plus, from the analytics,

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.540
I can learn which products
are selling and when.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.330
There are more than
8,000 easy-to-use apps,

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:55.830
which help with ad tracking,

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.740
integrating your shop
with TikTok or Pinterest,

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.890
or automatically recommending
frequently bought products.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.020
Despite it being so powerful,

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.960
Shopify is incredibly easy to use.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.060
So if you are just
starting out your business

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.790
or side hustle, or if you
wanna make the sales process

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:14.640
more efficient, you really
should be using Shopify.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.640
They power more entrepreneurs
than any other platform

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.240
with millions of businesses
in 175 countries.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.430
Seriously, Shopify is great,

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:27.570
and for a free trial, you can
go to shopify.com/veritasium

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.330
or just scan this QR code.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.070
And if you wanna buy a Snatoms kit,

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.830
there is a link for that
in the description too.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:36.060
So I wanna thank Shopify

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.440
for sponsoring this part of the video,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.603
and now back to earthquakes.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:42.960
- So for this next test,

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.570
they're gonna feed in the seismic signals

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.790
from the Great Hanshin earthquake

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:49.950
which is also known as
the Kobe earthquake.

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.770
It only lasted for about 20 seconds,

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:54.720
but it had a magnitude of 6.9,

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.560
and the maximum acceleration
was about 0.9 g,

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.510
which is, you know, kind
of crazy to think about

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:01.410
for an earthquake.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:13.343
Oh boy.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:16.293
Like, that rumble.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:19.583
Oh man.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.030
Oh, the whole building is,

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:24.863
oh my God.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.430
How short that was and
how powerful that was.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:46.473
Boy, earthquakes are no joke.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.770
- That's a nice way to
observe an earthquake.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:51.570
Like how else can you
observe an earthquake

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:54.090
without being subject
to that shaking, right?

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.310
No one has got to experience
the Kobe earthquake

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:59.343
from like just right
beside it, but not shaking.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:05.180
- In Kobe earthquake, we
recorded very, very large motion,

00:16:05.619 --> 00:16:06.663
but it's very short.

00:16:06.663 --> 00:16:09.000
But in 2011 in Japan earthquake,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.120
we recorded very, very
long duration motion,

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.500
like five minutes.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:18.180
And the bottom one,
it's expected earthquake

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.700
in future Tokai Tonankai earthquake.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:24.450
So we are expecting very,
very long duration motion.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:25.650
- [Petr] How do you predict

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.930
what kind of earthquake
you're going to get

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.190
- Ask seismologists.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:30.300
- [Petr] I'll ask seismologists.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.950
- I'm sorry about that.
- No, that's good.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.330
That's good.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.580
- Seismologists give a 70% chance

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.800
that a magnitude eight
earthquake will occur

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.690
somewhere near the Tokai region,

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:42.090
home to more than 15 million people

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:43.890
within the next 30 years.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:47.400
The Nankai trough located off
the southeast coast of Japan

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.140
is where the Eurasian plate pushes

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.120
against the Philippine plate and produces

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.270
a massive earthquake
every 100 years or so.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.220
But the Tokai region hasn't experienced

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.850
such an earthquake in over 160 years.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:00.870
The government estimates

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:04.890
that more than 320,000 people
could lose their lives.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.660
Most fatalities will likely be caused

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.400
by the 30 meter tsunami,

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.680
but a quarter, around 82,000,

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.260
could result from building collapse.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.503
This is why earthquake
preparedness is such a big deal.

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.969
- Newly built buildings
are very, very safe.

00:17:23.969 --> 00:17:28.470
You know, they, they have
very high seismic performance.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:33.210
So even in a very, very large earthquake,

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:35.610
you know, these buildings can survive.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:37.110
- [Derek] Except in extreme cases,

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.210
most new buildings in Japan can survive

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:40.710
most large earthquakes.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.320
So the next challenge is
to keep them functional.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.510
Currently, even when
buildings don't collapse,

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:47.580
water pipes often burst leaving people

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.380
without water and electricity,

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.780
and so they still have
to leave their homes.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.130
This is the next challenge

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.470
they're trying to solve at E-Defense.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:58.440
- So now we can prevent a fatal collapse,

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.428
but now we have to think how to prevent

00:18:01.428 --> 00:18:03.990
this kind of functional loss.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:05.400
- [Petr] You guys are now at the step

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.147
that's beyond what I was thinking, right?

00:18:07.147 --> 00:18:09.540
My step was like, how do we make sure

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.980
that houses don't fall down

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.990
and you guys are like, yeah,
no, we figured that out.

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.030
We can make sure that
houses don't fall down

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.410
more or less.

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:17.730
Doing this very important work

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:20.580
like you guys are making
the world a safer place.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.170
You guys are making Japan a safer place.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.390
You're updating building codes to make it,

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:26.130
you know, so fewer people die.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.500
- What I love about the story of E-Defense

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.200
is that Japan didn't simply
wait for more earthquakes

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.330
to happen and just hope for the best.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.310
They spent billions in research

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:38.430
to prevent people suffering
from these disasters.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.620
They realize that while they can't predict

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.170
the next big earthquake,
they can make sure

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.813
that they are prepared
when it does happen.
