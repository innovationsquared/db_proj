00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.870
Have you heard of Virtual Bagel? Their Facebook
page has over 4,000 likes.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.030
They use the page to promote their brilliant
business model 'we send you bagels via the

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.490
Internet -- just download and enjoy.'

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.300
It sounds like a joke, and it is, sort of.
This page was set up by BBC technology correspondent

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.539
Rory Cellan-Jones in 2012.

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.109
He wanted to find out what is the worth of
a like on a Facebook page, so he bought some

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.960
likes for Virtual Bagel. Now there are two
ways to buy 'likes', the legitimate way and

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.539
the illegitimate way.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.340
The illegitimate way is to go to a website
like BoostLikes.com purchase some likes. You

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.580
can get 1000 for $70.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.830
Sites like these use clickfarms in developing
countries like India, the Philippines, Nepal,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.480
Sri Lanka, Egypt, Indonesia and Bangladesh.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.760
Here employees are routinely paid just 1 dollar
per thousand clicks of the like button.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.210
So Facebook explicitly forbids buying likes
this way.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.110
Instead they offer the 'legitimate' way to
pay for likes by advertising your page. Prominently

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.530
displayed is a link to "Get more likes" with
the promise: "Connect with more of the people

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.070
who matter to you."

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.690
And this is how Virtual Bagel got its 4000
likes. Rory Cellan-Jones paid 100 dollars

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.440
to Facebook and the likes rolled in. He targeted
his ad to the UK and the United States, but

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.140
also to countries like Egypt, Indonesia and
the Philippines. Now where do you think Virtual

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.030
Bagel was most popular? I'll give you a hint,
it wasn't the US or the UK. But within a day

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.980
he had over 1600 likes mostly from developing
countries.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.630
Now what was more problematic was the people
who followed Virtual Bagel looked suspicious.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.780
For example there was one Cairo-based follower
whose name was Ahmed Ronaldo.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.070
His profile consisted almost exclusively of
pictures of Cristiano Ronaldo and he liked

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.750
3,000 pages.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.600
Cellan-Jones also observed that his new throng
of fans was particularly disengaged, just

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.100
as you'd imagine those from a click-farm would
be. But he hadn't hired a click-farm, he had

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.159
paid for Facebook ads.

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.390
This story was reported in July 2012. In August,
Facebook reported it had identified and deleted

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.580
83 million fake accounts (that was 9% of the
total at the time). This resulted in noticeable

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.140
drops for popular singers and celebrities.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.810
So did they delete all of the fake likes?
Nope, not even close. I know because most

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.700
of the likes on my Facebook page are not genuine.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.670
In May 2012, I received a number of emails
from Facebook offering me $50 worth of free

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.150
promotion of my page, which at the time had
only 2,000 likes.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.150
My YouTube channel had twenty times that following
so I thought surely this free 'paid' promotion

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.700
could help me reach more of the people who
mattered to me. And immediately I could see

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.230
results. Within just a few days my likes had
tripled, and they kept on growing, thousands

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.120
per day.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.840
And after a few months I had about 70,000
Facebook likes, which matched my YouTube subscribers

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.180
at the time. Now what was weird was my posts
on Facebook didn't seem to be getting any

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.010
more engagement than when I had 2,000. If
anything, they were getting less engagement.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.279
I didn't understand why at the time, but I
have since realized it's because most of those

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:03.749
likes I was gaining through Facebook ads were
not from people who were genuinely interested

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:10.059
in Veritasium. How do I know? Well because
fake likes behave very differently from real

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.829
followers.

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.849
Have a look at this graph of the engagement
of my Facebook followers. Here I'm plotting

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:20.319
countries as bubbles, so this is Canada and
the size represents the number of likes I've

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.370
received from that country. So this is the
United States, it's a nice big bubble. Now

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.430
I'm ranking these countries on the horizontal
axis based on what percentage of those likes

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.389
have engaged with my page this month. So as
you can see roughly 30% Canadians and Americans

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:39.999
have engaged with my page, but they're not
as active as the Germans where over 40% of

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:45.079
my likes have engaged, and they are not as
active as the Austrians a small but passionate

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.829
group of Veritasium fans at nearly 60%

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.379
These are all of the other Western countries.
So you can see that it's common for between

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.230
25% and 35% of my page likes to engage with
my page every month.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.680
Now here is Egypt, where less than 1% of my
likes have engaged with my page. Now this

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.719
is India, the Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh,
Indonesia, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:14.480
That's a big followings, but no engagement.
Together all of these countries make up 80,000

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.590
likes, that's roughly 75% of the total likes
I had before the last video. And these are

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.080
the profiles that followed me when I used
Facebook advertising. And they are worse than

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.099
useless. Here's why:

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:30.900
When you make a post, Facebook distributes
it to a small fraction of the people who like

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.569
your page just to gauge their reaction.
If they engage with it by liking, commenting,

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:39.300
and sharing then Facebook distributes the
post to more of your likes and even their

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.330
friends.
Now if you somehow accumulate fake likes,

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.659
Facebook's initial distribution goes out to
fewer real fans, and therefore it receives

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:51.560
less engagement, and so consequently you reach
a smaller number of people. That's how a rising

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.830
number of fans can result in a drop in engagement.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.259
And from this Facebook makes money twice over
-- once to help you acquire new fans, and

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:03.740
then again when you try to reach them. I mean
your organic reach may be so restricted by

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.050
the lack of engagement, that your only option
is to pay to promote the post.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.470
What's worse, there is no way to delete fake
likes in bulk -- all you can do is target

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.610
posts around them.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.460
And I should re-iterate I never bought fake
likes. I used Facebook's legitimate advertising,

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.330
but the results are as if I had paid for fake
likes from a clickfarm.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.159
Now you might think the solution to all this
is just to exclude countries with click-farms

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:33.729
from your ad campaigns. But unfortunately
the problem goes much deeper.

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:36.949
Meet Virtual Cat, a virtual pet like none
other.

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:42.680
Its page is committed to supplying only the
worst, most annoying drivel you can imagine.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.439
Only an idiot would like this page. And that's
not just my opinion, that's actually what

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:50.090
it says in the page description.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.419
And I should know because I wrote it. I created
this page yesterday and I then paid $10 to

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:01.159
advertise the page through Facebook targeted
only to cat-lovers in the United States, Canada,

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:06.259
Australia and the UK. Now I expected that
because I had excluded all of the big click-farm

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:11.469
countries and because the page is so terrible
that I basically wouldn't get any likes. But

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:17.080
within 20 minutes I had blown through my whole
budget and I got 39 likes. So who are these

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.539
people liking a blank page and costing me
25 cents a piece?

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.800
All of the profiles were all from the places
I had targeted, mostly the US, but there was

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:31.460
something strange about them. All of these
people liked a LOT of things, like hundreds

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.860
and thousands things.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.080
And a lot of the things they liked were odd
too. Like in one account this person liked

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:44.819
T-mobile, AT&amp;T and Verizon. They liked Jeep
and Lexus and Mercedes and Volvo and Volkswagon.

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:49.120
They like everything. Other accounts I saw,
they liked kitchen scrubbers and they liked

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.120
mouthwash. Who reports that on their Facebook
page? It just baffles me.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.530
So the real mystery to me is why someone,
somewhere would click on ads they didn't care

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.580
about without making money from them. I mean
I don't think these likes came from bots - they

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.580
are too easy to identify and eliminate. And
I also don't think for a second Facebook would

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:13.139
pay click-farms to click on those ads to generate
revenue for them, so it really seems like

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:14.099
a mystery.

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:19.759
And then, in this article I found what I think
is the most reasonable hypothesis.

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:25.319
Click-farms click the ads for free. In order
to avoid detection by Facebook's fraud algorithms,

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:29.960
they like pages other than the ones they've
been paid for to seem more genuine. I mean

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.229
you can imagine 1000 likes on a particular
page coming from one geographic area in a

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:40.219
short period of time would seem suspicious.
But buried in a torrent of other 'like' activity?

00:07:40.219 --> 00:07:42.530
They would be impossible to identify.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:46.430
So workers at these click-farms will literally
click anything. I mean where do you think

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:53.430
Facebook's Security page is most popular?
Dhaka, Bangladesh. What about Google? Dhaka.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:58.449
What about soccer star David Beckham? It's
actually Cairo, but you take my point.

00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:03.150
So wherever you're targeting, advertising
your page on Facebook is a waste of money.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:07.550
I wish Facebook would remove the fake likes
from my page and all the others. But that

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:12.020
would mean admitting that they have generated
significant ad revenue from clicks that weren't

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:16.830
genuine, which then suppressed the reach of
pages who had low engagement, forcing those

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:22.879
pages to pay again to reach inauthentic fans.
So the truth is Facebook benefits by maintaining

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:27.520
this status quo because the reality is nobody
likes this many things.
