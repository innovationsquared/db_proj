00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.970
Alright here is the setup: I have a rifle
mounted vertically and we're going to shoot

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.580
a bullet into this block, right into the middle
of it.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.280
So obviously the block is going to go flying
into the air.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.219
But we're going to do this again and instead
of firing the bullet right into the middle

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.060
of the block, we're going to shoot it off
to one side and I want you to make a prediction.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.590
Will that spinning block, when we shoot hit
it to one side, will it go the same height

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.140
as this first block?

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.140
Will it go not as high?

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.800
Or will it go higher?

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.700
OK so versus being shot in the middle, when
you shoot on the side is the question, right?

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.700
Yeah.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.800
How high will it go in comparison?

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.370
It depends on if the bullet stays in the block
- and I'm assuming it does?

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.790
It does stay in the block, yes, I'll guarantee
you that.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.790
Same height.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.180
I'm purely basing it on just like an instinct
that I have.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.260
I feel like I'm being tricked.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.780
I just feel like you're trying to trick us
and that it's going to do something that we

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.780
can't predict.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.750
I feel like the obvious answer is not as high
so I'm going to say higher.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.530
I'll say higher, but it's going to like fly
in a different direction or something.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.540
So you have angular momentum, which is L,
and you have translational momentum, which

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.152
is P. When you hit it in the middle of the
block, the block doesn't really spin at all

00:01:10.152 --> 00:01:12.330
so it just goes up to a certain height.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.570
But when you hit it on the side of the block,
it's going to be spinning so it's going to

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.680
have imparted some kinetic energy so there
won't be as much potential energy.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.920
So the total energy of the system basically
has to stay constant and the kinetic plus

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.470
potential, which would be the height it goes
to will have to be constant so if it's spinning

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.299
it has kinetic energy, it can't go as high.

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:29.299
That's my prediction.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.700
So my prediction is it'll go up, not as high
but it'll spin more if it's hit to the side.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.650
Am I wrong?

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.360
I want you to think which do you think is
the most reasonable and then click one of

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.659
the annotations above.

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.159
Alright are you ready?

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.240
Make your prediction in three, two, one...
