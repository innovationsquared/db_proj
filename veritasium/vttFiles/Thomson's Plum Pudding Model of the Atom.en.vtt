00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.230
So the word atom means uncuttable

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.110
so the Greeks were thinking of it as a tiny hard
sphere
Phil: that's right
Derek: and even up until the eighteen

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.679
hundred's that was the idea of an atom, the
smallest piece of matter, a tiny hard sphere

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.250
but then we find out that that's not quite
right

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.420
not quite

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.320
there were experiments in the eighteen hundreds
that discovered the electron, JJ Thomson's

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.660
experiments

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.910
really worked out the electron was

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.660
smaller than an atom, about 1000
times smaller than a hydrogen atom

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.210
and it was in all atoms

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.150
that's right, not just hydrogen

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.780
whatever material he did his experiments on
he found there was electrons in them

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.830
there are electrons in an all atoms

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.190
so I guess when you find something smaller than an atom
you need to propose a new model for the atom

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.430
that actually has something smaller in it some
substructure
Phil: that's right so something

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.470
like this

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.280
this is our model of the atom
Phil: This is our model of the atom -

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.740
in his day, it was known as the plum pudding
model but uh... here we have

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.060
cherry tart
Phil: cherry tart, ok so

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.310
but the idea being that we have an overall atom

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.620
usually pictured as spherical rather than 2D but

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.770
uh... but imbedded within it

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.830
and this is the important part

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.650
there are negative electrons represented by
cherries and they can come out

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.020
the overall atom is neutral, so

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.410
that means that pudding part must be positive
Derek: now how would you get one of these

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.260
electrons

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.070
out of our pudding here

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.020
so electrons are negatively charged so we'll need
to put something very positive which attracts

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.850
electrons, a high voltage
Derek: and that would have
the effect of say like

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.300
plucking a cherry out of the pudding

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.310
that's pretty much it

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.670
yeah you could do it kind of like that

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.929
so we're simulating

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:49.080
what it would be like

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.470
to put a positive charge up here.
Phil: that's right, that's right
Derek: pulling the electrons out of the atom

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.509
that's quite a

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.680
delicious
Phil: Yeah!

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.729
well that is the most delicious model of the atom,
I've gotta say

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.780
so shall we uh split the atom?

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.090
why don't you go ahead
Phil: you want me to do it? 
Derek: yes

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.439
Who knows what could happen,
a whole bunch of energy could be released.
Phil: Yeah

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:11.999
one, two, three...
