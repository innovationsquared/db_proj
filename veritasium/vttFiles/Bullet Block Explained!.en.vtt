00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.060
In my last video we performed an experiment
in which two identical wood blocks were shot

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.990
with the same rifle, one through the center
of mass and the other one slightly off to

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.990
one side.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.420
Now if you haven’t seen that video yet,
then click here now and go and watch it.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.720
Or, if you are on a mobile device, click the
link in the description.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.780
So the question was: Compared to the block
shot straight through its center, how high

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.190
would the block shot to one side go?

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.480
Now 60 percent of you predicted that it wouldn’t
go as high.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.969
&gt;&gt; It didn’t seem as high.

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:37.309
&gt;&gt; Now check out the high speed footage.

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.290
&gt;&gt; Oh, no.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.929
&gt;&gt; You can clearly see that both blocks...

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:41.929
&gt;&gt; What?

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:43.139
&gt;&gt; ... go to the exact same height.

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:44.190
&gt;&gt; Oh, come on.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.839
&gt;&gt; Nineteen percent said that it would go
higher.

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:52.569
And only 21 percent correctly predicted that
both blocks would go to the exact same height.

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:56.859
So most of us got it wrong the first time
around and that includes Henry and me and

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:59.029
Destin who has a lot of experience with this
stuff.

00:00:59.029 --> 00:01:02.639
&gt;&gt; I mean, I can’t tell you how many times
I have hit wood with a rifle.

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:06.500
&gt;&gt; So even experienced and intelligent people
get it wrong sometimes.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.640
In this case I think the result was particularly
counter intuitive, because the spinning block

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.890
clearly ended up with more energy than the
other block.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.560
So I asked you guys to make me a video response
and explain what is happening.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.400
And this is what I received.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:29.230
&gt;&gt; If you imagine the bullet traveling through
the center of the block, then...

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:35.750
[multiple voices]

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.000
&gt;&gt; Whoa.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.740
That is a lot of video responses.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.250
And that is not even all of them.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.430
I have got to say I was blown away by all
of the great video responses I received.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.850
You guys are awesome and really, really appreciate
all the effort you went to.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.590
You know, some of you actually replicated
the experiment, perhaps with different setups.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.630
&gt;&gt; Oh, ah.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.090
&gt;&gt; The experiment was featured on blog posts,
including Scientific America and Wired.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.530
There is an interactive simulation you can
try.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.750
Link is in the description.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.729
And someone even made a web comic.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.239
It is so incredible, you know, watching all
of those video responses.

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.950
And I did watch all of them.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.569
That was my proudest moment making this YouTube
channel, seeing all of you guys doing science

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.340
and getting so involved and putting in so
much effort.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.560
It just blows my mind.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.560
It is amazing.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.250
Thank you guys so much.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.250
Thank you, thank you.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.659
I can’t even put it into words how awesome
it is.

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.019
Whoo.

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.629
So what is the answer?

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.030
How could two identical blocks shot with the
same rifle end up with different amounts of

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.030
energy?

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.390
Well, some of you felt that the amount of
rotational energy would be basically insignificant.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.180
&gt;&gt; What if the amount of energy necessary
to get that very small block rotating really

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.140
is negligible in comparison to the amount
of energy necessary to lift it into the air

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.140
and resist gravity?

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.909
&gt;&gt; Well, we can calculate it, because the
spinning block was rotating at about 11 times

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:03.940
per second.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.330
So you can calculate that its rotational energy
would be equal to 50 percent of the gravitational

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.209
potential energy when those blocks were at
their peak.

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.650
So the spinning block actually had 1.5 times
the energy of the non-rotating block.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.090
And in my books that is not negligible.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.370
So what else could be causing this?

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.750
Well, some of you actually measured the height
difference using pixel counters and found

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.230
that the blocks didn't go to exactly the same
height.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.799
So this raises an important question, which
is: How different would those heights have

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.530
to be before you can think that there really
is a difference there?

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.799
Well, given that the rotational energy is
about 50 percent of the gravitational potential

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.180
energy, you might expect the spinning block
to go half as high.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.950
But looking at the video footage you can clearly
see it doesn’t go half as high.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.609
It goes basically to the same height.

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.309
To know for sure, you would probably want
to do the experiment a number of times.

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:58.969
In science you have got to repeat things and
make sure what you saw is not just a fluke,

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:00.809
that it will happen every time.

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:05.400
So, in fact, we did repeat the experiment
a number of times and here are all of the

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:14.639
blocks lined up side by side so you can compare
their heights.

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.780
The blocks clearly do not all go to the same
height.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.259
So you might say: Derek, you were tricking
us.

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:22.699
You just picked the two that went the closest
and used those.

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:23.699
It is true.

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:24.699
I did do that.

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.849
But the point is do the spinning blocks go
systematically to a lower height than the

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:29.919
non-spinning blocks?

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.860
And I think from the video footage the answer
is clearly no.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.560
So why not?

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.840
Well, another common response I saw was that
air resistance must play a role, that the

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.030
spinning block exposes a small surface area
as it is traveling upwards and this means

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.050
there is less air resistance impeding it.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.830
So even with a lower velocity it could make
it to the same height as the non-spinning

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.830
block.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.259
But you can do the calculation and find that
the difference in air resistance would be,

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.169
at most, about 0.6 percent of the weight of
the block.

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.560
In other words, negligible.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.139
So what is the real answer?

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.530
Well, there are a number of ways of approaching
the problem and I saw you guys try almost

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.500
all of them: force, torque, momentum, energy.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.120
But the easiest one of these is the law of
conservation of momentum.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.470
You see, when the bullet is fired out of the
rifle it has a certain amount of momentum

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.970
entirely in the vertical direction.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.520
And when the bullet becomes lodged in the
block the bullet and block together must have

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.009
that same momentum that the bullet had.

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:36.410
Now it doesn’t matter where on the block
the bullet hits, because the bullet had a

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.240
certain momentum before it hit the block.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.539
The block and bullet together afterwards must
have that amount of momentum upwards.

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:46.699
So this means regardless of whether the block
is spinning or not, it must have the same

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:52.120
upwards velocity, so that it has the same
momentum, so it will got the same height regardless

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.039
of whether it is spinning or not.

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:56.800
It is simple conservation of momentum.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.939
Momentum is always, always conserved.

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:01.210
It is something you can always rely on.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.289
And it is why you should think about it first.

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:07.569
But some of you may say: Ok, well, there is
also angular momentum in the spinning block.

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:12.240
But the point is: Angular moment and linear
momentum are independent and they are conserved

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.240
independently.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.300
So you can simply think about the upward momentum
of the bullet and that is going to have to

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.139
be the upward momentum of those two blocks
and it doesn’t matter that one is spinning,

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:24.330
because they have the same total linear momentum
upwards.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.410
So they have to go to the same height.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.669
But if that is the case, why does the spinning
block end up with this extra rotational energy?

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:35.550
Well, the thing about energy is it is a little
bit tricky.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.580
Although total energy is conserved, the energy
of motion—which is called kinetic energy—is

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.990
not conserved.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:47.490
So what happens is as the bullet strikes the
wood a lot of its kinetic energy is lost,

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.560
heating up the wood, creating sound and deforming
that wood block.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.669
So it would be possible for the rotating block
to end up with more energy of motion, more

00:06:55.669 --> 00:07:02.370
kinetic energy, if the bullet loses less energy
deforming the wood and heating it up and creating

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.870
that sound.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.180
And this kind of makes a little bit of intuitive
sense, because if you imagine the bullet entering

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:14.039
the block on the side, the block will be moving
away from it faster, because it is rotating.

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:17.871
So that may mean that the bullet doesn’t
penetrate in as far and so it wouldn’t lose

00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:22.580
as much energy as it is entering the wood,
which explains why the block has extra energy

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.909
allowing it to rotate and go the same height
as the other block.

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:29.860
Let’s have a look at how far in the bullet
went into each block.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:30.860
This is our first test.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.159
Here we go.

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:33.479
This is the one where it went straight in.

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:35.409
&gt;&gt; There.

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:37.339
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:39.810
&gt;&gt; And we come over here to the opposite end.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.539
&gt;&gt; This is where the bullet went in off center.

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:43.389
&gt;&gt; It is not going in here.

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:44.800
See where my...?

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.539
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let’s see the other one.

00:07:47.539 --> 00:07:49.069
&gt;&gt; Ok.

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:52.349
It is all the way in.

00:07:52.349 --> 00:07:54.210
It is part way in.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:58.620
&gt;&gt; So the bullet didn’t go as far into the
spinning block.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.720
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.199
&gt;&gt; So that was pretty convincing evidence.

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:05.270
But just to be extra sure we x-rayed both
blocks and this is what we saw.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:10.639
I am going to overlay the blocks so we can
see the difference in penetration depth.

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:11.639
Hang on.

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:17.430
It looks like both blocks penetrated each
block to the same depth.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.550
So does that mean our theory is wrong?

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.120
Well, let’s think about how different the
bullet depths should be.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.939
I mean, when the bullet strikes the block
it actually loses 97 percent of its original

00:08:27.939 --> 00:08:28.939
kinetic energy.

00:08:28.939 --> 00:08:33.889
And the amount of rotational energy the spinning
block has only works out to about one percent

00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:36.240
of the original kinetic energy of the bullet.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.740
So we would only expect a difference in depths
of about one percent.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:44.670
And for our measurements, that would be about
a tenth of a millimeter.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:49.430
That would be immeasurable and that is what
we see.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:55.060
So although this answer is a little bit unsatisfying,
at least it is the truth.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:59.060
As an extra challenge, I want you guys to
think about how we could perhaps modify this

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.490
experiment so the difference in bullet depth
would be measurable.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.660
You can leave your answers in the comments
or make me another video response, because

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:10.570
I love those so much.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:14.690
This episode of Veritasium was brought to
you by Audible.com, a leading provider of

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:18.240
audio books with over 100,000 titles in all
different types of literature.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.080
Now today I wanted to recommend a book that
changed my life.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.010
It is called The Four Hour Work Week and it
is by Tim Faris who I actually got to meet

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.589
this year at VidCon.

00:09:26.589 --> 00:09:29.480
So I read this book about three years ago
when I was thinking about quitting my job

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.709
and starting this YouTube channel.

00:09:30.709 --> 00:09:33.260
And it is one of the things that contributed
to my decision.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.910
So if you are thinking about quitting your
job, perhaps this is the book for you.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:41.150
You can actually download it for free by going
to Audible.com/Veritasium, click the link
