00:00:00.060,00:00:01.170,"- [Derek] This is a video"
00:00:01.170,00:00:04.170,"about how Japanese swords are made,"
00:00:04.170,00:00:06.750,"swords that are strong enough and sharp enough"
00:00:06.750,00:00:09.240,"to slice a bullet in half."
00:00:09.240,00:00:12.300,"The access we got for this video is incredible."
00:00:12.300,00:00:16.140,"We were able to film everything from gathering the iron sand"
00:00:16.140,00:00:19.503,"to smelting the iron, forging the sword,"
00:00:20.490,00:00:23.310,"to sharpening and polishing it."
00:00:23.310,00:00:25.620,"They even let us use it."
00:00:25.620,00:00:26.870,"- [Petr] That is so cool!"
00:00:28.860,00:00:30.540,"- [Derek] The method of making these swords"
00:00:30.540,00:00:34.740,"has remained virtually unchanged for hundreds of years,"
00:00:34.740,00:00:37.263,"with everything done by hand."
00:00:38.220,00:00:41.820,"They are still considered to be among the best in the world."
00:00:41.820,00:00:43.740,"- The Japanese made a weapon"
00:00:43.740,00:00:47.130,"that was the absolute pinnacle for their style of warfare"
00:00:47.130,00:00:48.880,"and the materials they had at hand."
00:00:49.890,00:00:52.770,"- These swords are held in such high regard"
00:00:52.770,00:00:54.450,"that one from the 16th century"
00:00:54.450,00:00:57.813,"has been appraised at $105 million,"
00:00:58.650,00:01:02.516,"making it the most expensive sword ever built."
00:01:02.516,00:01:06.441,"(sword thwacks) (dramatic music)"
00:01:06.441,00:01:09.930,"(river noises)"
00:01:09.930,00:01:12.240,"In the Shimane province of Japan"
00:01:12.240,00:01:16.770,"there is a smelter that is lit for only one night each year"
00:01:16.770,00:01:21.663,"where steel is made in the same way it was 1300 years ago."
00:01:22.710,00:01:25.260,"It's known as the Tatara method,"
00:01:25.260,00:01:27.840,"and only steel made in this way ends up"
00:01:27.840,00:01:30.243,"in the very best Japanese swords."
00:01:31.560,00:01:34.657,"And we were invited to come film it."
00:01:34.657,00:01:38.430,"(drums and flute music)"
00:01:38.430,00:01:42.210,"Just after 9:00 AM, the ceremonial prayers are said"
00:01:42.210,00:01:44.733,"and the fire is lit by a Shinto priest."
00:01:46.230,00:01:48.780,"Everyone that will be working this smelter will be here"
00:01:48.780,00:01:51.630,"for at least the next 24 hours."
00:01:51.630,00:01:54.930,"That includes Veritasium producer Petr."
00:01:54.930,00:01:56.580,"- I'm committed. We're gonna do this."
00:01:56.580,00:01:57.907,"It's gonna be fun."
00:01:59.160,00:02:03.360,"- [Derek] Sword making in Japan goes back about 3000 years,"
00:02:03.360,00:02:06.900,"but in those days, swords were made out of bronze."
00:02:06.900,00:02:10.470,"We're not sure how people first learned to smelt metal,"
00:02:10.470,00:02:13.470,"but it was likely related to pottery."
00:02:13.470,00:02:15.450,"- In that you were using these rocky oars"
00:02:15.450,00:02:17.610,"to make glazes and such for pottery"
00:02:17.610,00:02:20.190,"under very controlled atmospheres."
00:02:20.190,00:02:23.160,"And then find maybe the potters found metallic beads"
00:02:23.160,00:02:25.440,"in the bottom of the furnaces that they were firing it."
00:02:25.440,00:02:27.780,"This possibly gave them the idea."
00:02:27.780,00:02:29.910,"- [Derek] Bronze was discovered before steel"
00:02:29.910,00:02:33.570,"because it's an alloy of copper, and usually tin,"
00:02:33.570,00:02:35.520,"both metals with low enough melting points"
00:02:35.520,00:02:39.120,"that they can be smelted in regular pottery kilns."
00:02:39.120,00:02:40.320,"The problem with bronze"
00:02:40.320,00:02:42.510,"is that although it can be sharpened,"
00:02:42.510,00:02:45.480,"it's too soft to hold an edge for long."
00:02:45.480,00:02:49.590,"So Japanese sword makers shifted to steel 1200 years ago"
00:02:49.590,00:02:51.540,"in the Heian period."
00:02:51.540,00:02:53.730,"This is what most people would recognize"
00:02:53.730,00:02:55.410,"as a Japanese sword."
00:02:55.410,00:02:58.173,"It's made of steel with a curved blade."
00:03:01.470,00:03:03.540,"Steel is an alloy of iron,"
00:03:03.540,00:03:06.690,"the fourth-most-common element in Earth's crust."
00:03:06.690,00:03:11.520,"The oceans of the world used to be rich with dissolved iron."
00:03:11.520,00:03:13.500,"But two and a half billion years ago,"
00:03:13.500,00:03:18.090,"cyanobacteria started photosynthesizing and creating oxygen."
00:03:18.090,00:03:20.310,"The iron reacted with that oxygen"
00:03:20.310,00:03:21.930,"precipitating out of solution"
00:03:21.930,00:03:25.470,"to be deposited at the bottom of the ocean."
00:03:25.470,00:03:29.010,"Incidentally, the cyanobacteria were poisoned by the oxygen"
00:03:29.010,00:03:31.230,"that they themselves produced"
00:03:31.230,00:03:33.420,"so it's thought that when levels got high enough,"
00:03:33.420,00:03:37.050,"they died off, and as a result, oxygen levels dropped"
00:03:37.050,00:03:40.830,"and iron no longer precipitated out of solution."
00:03:40.830,00:03:43.320,"Then the cyanobacteria could multiply again"
00:03:43.320,00:03:44.883,"and the cycle repeated."
00:03:45.720,00:03:48.810,"That's why most of the world's iron is found in layers"
00:03:48.810,00:03:53.160,"of sedimentary rock called banded iron formations."
00:03:53.160,00:03:55.320,"Each layer of iron was formed"
00:03:55.320,00:03:58.410,"during a global flourishing of cyanobacteria"
00:03:58.410,00:04:01.620,"that infused the ocean with oxygen."
00:04:01.620,00:04:03.570,"The majority of the global iron supply"
00:04:03.570,00:04:06.330,"comes from these banded iron formations"
00:04:06.330,00:04:09.450,"because of their high concentration of iron,"
00:04:09.450,00:04:12.903,"up to around 60% iron oxide by weight."
00:04:14.775,00:04:16.500,"(gentle music)"
00:04:16.500,00:04:19.500,"But Japan, with its mostly volcanic geology,"
00:04:19.500,00:04:22.890,"has barely any of these sedimentary iron oxides."
00:04:22.890,00:04:24.960,"And this is likely why the country was late"
00:04:24.960,00:04:26.940,"to the steel production game."
00:04:26.940,00:04:30.090,"Archeologists have found steel artifacts in Anatolia,"
00:04:30.090,00:04:34.740,"which is modern day Turkey, that are nearly 4,000 years old."
00:04:34.740,00:04:37.230,"But in Japan, metals including steel,"
00:04:37.230,00:04:39.030,"were imported from China and Korea"
00:04:39.030,00:04:41.100,"up until the eighth century"
00:04:41.100,00:04:44.670,"when Japan started making its own steel."
00:04:44.670,00:04:47.433,"So where did they get the raw ingredients?"
00:04:49.860,00:04:52.470,"Well, igneous rocks like granite and diorite"
00:04:52.470,00:04:54.630,"still contain iron oxides,"
00:04:54.630,00:04:57.300,"just in much lower concentrations."
00:04:57.300,00:04:59.130,"But as the mountains are weathered,"
00:04:59.130,00:05:03.240,"these iron oxides are broken apart and washed downstream."
00:05:03.240,00:05:05.703,"Eventually they become part of the sand."
00:05:07.350,00:05:10.110,"The Japanese noticed that because iron oxides"
00:05:10.110,00:05:12.750,"are denser than other minerals in the sand,"
00:05:12.750,00:05:14.460,"they accumulate in places"
00:05:14.460,00:05:17.460,"where the river changes direction or speed."
00:05:17.460,00:05:19.470,"The heavier iron sinks to the bottom"
00:05:19.470,00:05:21.663,"and the lighter material is washed away."
00:05:23.700,00:05:25.140,"To amplify this effect,"
00:05:25.140,00:05:28.170,"they deliberately created diversions in the river"
00:05:28.170,00:05:30.960,"to increase the concentration of iron."
00:05:30.960,00:05:33.600,"- What do you do is you dam off a section of river"
00:05:33.600,00:05:36.270,"and then you drag sand into it."
00:05:36.270,00:05:39.780,"Because iron is heavier than the other parts of the sand,"
00:05:39.780,00:05:41.430,"it is the thing that gets left behind"
00:05:41.430,00:05:44.490,"and everything else gets washed downstream."
00:05:44.490,00:05:46.650,"- [Derek] With this method, you can get iron sands"
00:05:46.650,00:05:49.590,"with 80% iron oxides by weight."
00:05:49.590,00:05:52.803,"That's more concentrated than high-quality iron ore."
00:05:54.060,00:05:55.860,"And since it has fewer impurities,"
00:05:55.860,00:05:59.463,"it's an excellent source for high-quality steel."
00:06:00.330,00:06:02.070,"If you heat up those iron oxides"
00:06:02.070,00:06:04.860,"to over 1,250 degrees Celsius,"
00:06:04.860,00:06:08.850,"you can break the bonds with oxygen and get pure iron."
00:06:08.850,00:06:12.540,"But pure iron is actually softer than bronze."
00:06:12.540,00:06:16.380,"So in its elemental state, iron provides no advantage."
00:06:16.380,00:06:19.500,"But nature gave humans a lucky break."
00:06:19.500,00:06:21.840,"One of the few ways you can heat something up"
00:06:21.840,00:06:25.500,"to 1,250 degrees is with charcoal,"
00:06:25.500,00:06:28.650,"and charcoal is basically pure carbon,"
00:06:28.650,00:06:32.130,"and if you add just a little bit of carbon to iron,"
00:06:32.130,00:06:36.743,"it creates an incredibly strong alloy: steel."
00:06:36.743,00:06:39.840,"- Yeah, a lot of people see it as a heat process."
00:06:39.840,00:06:42.480,"I see it as a chemical process."
00:06:42.480,00:06:45.060,"- [Derek] Alloys are usually stronger than pure metals"
00:06:45.060,00:06:48.120,"because they contain different sized atoms,"
00:06:48.120,00:06:50.250,"and this reduces the ability of atoms"
00:06:50.250,00:06:53.943,"to slide past each other when an external force is applied."
00:06:57.540,00:07:02.220,"- So I've just been given gloves, other gloves, and a towel."
00:07:02.220,00:07:05.820,"So things are very much getting real."
00:07:05.820,00:07:08.339,"I'm genuinely quite worried."
00:07:08.339,00:07:09.780,"(serious music)"
00:07:09.780,00:07:12.750,"Here is the room with all of the charcoal"
00:07:12.750,00:07:14.910,"that we're going to be using overnight."
00:07:14.910,00:07:18.573,"There's just bags and bags of this stuff."
00:07:21.695,00:07:24.612,"(charcoal rattles)"
00:07:25.570,00:07:28.320,"(flame crackles)"
00:07:30.016,00:07:31.957,"There's a Buddhist saying:"
00:07:31.957,00:07:35.670,"""Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water."
00:07:35.670,00:07:39.420,"After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water."""
00:07:46.020,00:07:49.113,"So we're lining up on the four corners, I guess."
00:07:50.144,00:07:53.061,"(charcoal rattles)"
00:07:55.088,00:07:56.850,"Oh. Oh boy."
00:07:56.850,00:08:00.033,"Didn't do a great job of that. (chuckles)"
00:08:00.941,00:08:01.860,"(thunder rumbles)"
00:08:01.860,00:08:02.910,"So the rain is coming,"
00:08:02.910,00:08:05.010,"so we're quickly getting all of the charcoal out"
00:08:05.010,00:08:06.780,"and then measuring it."
00:08:06.780,00:08:10.210,"So each bag of these is 10 kilos. Okay."
00:08:10.210,00:08:13.380,"(serious music)"
00:08:13.380,00:08:17.310,"So with the iron sand, it is mixed together with water"
00:08:17.310,00:08:18.960,"because if you don't mix it with water"
00:08:18.960,00:08:21.710,"and you put it on the flame, it just flies straight up."
00:08:22.590,00:08:25.440,"But if you mix it with too much water,"
00:08:25.440,00:08:27.750,"then there is water that's gonna heat up."
00:08:27.750,00:08:28.770,"It's gonna become water vapor,"
00:08:28.770,00:08:31.320,"and the whole kiln could explode."
00:08:31.320,00:08:34.230,"Terrifyingly enough, they do this by feel."
00:08:34.230,00:08:38.790,"They mix in enough water until the iron sand is clumpy."
00:08:38.790,00:08:43.707,"But again, if it's too much, the whole thing could explode."
00:08:56.467,00:08:58.383,"Okay, put some iron in."
00:09:00.330,00:09:01.800,"It is just past four in the afternoon,"
00:09:01.800,00:09:02.820,"and over the last couple of hours"
00:09:02.820,00:09:06.180,"we have added 250 kilograms of charcoal"
00:09:06.180,00:09:09.660,"and nearly 60 kilograms of iron sand."
00:09:09.660,00:09:11.850,"So yeah, it's a slow process,"
00:09:11.850,00:09:14.610,"but I think we're starting to get somewhere."
00:09:14.610,00:09:17.403,"I have no idea because obviously the thing is hidden,"
00:09:18.750,00:09:20.613,"but it should be growing."
00:09:22.800,00:09:24.600,"- [Derek] To achieve the high temperatures"
00:09:24.600,00:09:26.280,"required to make steel,"
00:09:26.280,00:09:29.880,"you need a strong, steady supply of oxygen."
00:09:29.880,00:09:31.500,"For hundreds of years,"
00:09:31.500,00:09:35.040,"this was provided by huge foot-operated bellows."
00:09:35.040,00:09:38.130,"It would've taken an around-the-clock, full-body effort"
00:09:38.130,00:09:42.150,"by many men to maintain the furnace's temperature."
00:09:42.150,00:09:42.983,"- When I came here,"
00:09:42.983,00:09:45.420,"I was a little bit sad that the bellows were electric."
00:09:45.420,00:09:48.720,"I really wanted to, you know, have this proper experience,"
00:09:48.720,00:09:49.800,"have this proper workout"
00:09:49.800,00:09:53.223,"of stepping on these bellows for 24 hours."
00:09:54.742,00:09:57.510,"(serious music)"
00:09:57.510,00:09:59.190,"- [Derek] The temperature inside the smelter"
00:09:59.190,00:10:02.070,"gets up to 1500 degrees Celsius,"
00:10:02.070,00:10:06.450,"just below the melting point of iron, which is 1538 Celsius."
00:10:06.450,00:10:09.750,"So the iron being smelted isn't liquid,"
00:10:09.750,00:10:11.670,"but it's soft and malleable enough"
00:10:11.670,00:10:15.000,"to clump together into a big block of iron."
00:10:15.000,00:10:17.760,"No matter how high quality the iron sand is,"
00:10:17.760,00:10:20.070,"there will always be some impurities,"
00:10:20.070,00:10:23.730,"like sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon oxides."
00:10:23.730,00:10:26.250,"They combine with carbon from the charcoal"
00:10:26.250,00:10:28.920,"and melt at a lower temperature than iron,"
00:10:28.920,00:10:32.430,"so they become liquid and flow to the bottom."
00:10:32.430,00:10:34.593,"This is known as slag."
00:10:35.490,00:10:39.150,"After many more hours of adding charcoal and iron sand,"
00:10:39.150,00:10:42.123,"it is time for the first removal of the slag."
00:10:43.290,00:10:46.573,"Before the first removal of slag, another prayer is said."
00:10:46.573,00:10:49.920,"(steelworkers clap)"
00:10:49.920,00:10:51.107,"- Oh, that's insane."
00:11:06.287,00:11:08.162,"(slag sizzles)"
00:11:08.162,00:11:10.707,"(serious music)"
00:11:10.707,00:11:13.457,"(hammer pinging)"
00:11:15.512,00:11:16.345,"Whoa."
00:11:18.750,00:11:20.100,"So for the last three hours,"
00:11:20.100,00:11:22.950,"there's been three processes that we've been doing."
00:11:22.950,00:11:26.880,"One is adding the charcoal, two is adding the iron sand,"
00:11:26.880,00:11:30.600,"and three is opening up the smelter from the bottom"
00:11:30.600,00:11:34.507,"to break apart the impurities so they can flow out."
00:11:43.420,00:11:46.170,"(shovels scrape)"
00:11:54.480,00:11:57.960,"Just want you guys to know that it's 3:16 in the morning"
00:11:57.960,00:12:00.693,"and I'm still here and I'm really sleepy."
00:12:01.632,00:12:04.382,"(subdued music)"
00:12:06.360,00:12:09.330,"So it's currently six o'clock in the morning the next day."
00:12:09.330,00:12:11.160,"We've been smelting for 21 hours."
00:12:11.160,00:12:13.770,"I'm exhausted, but the sun is about to come out"
00:12:13.770,00:12:16.110,"and it's been pretty amazing, I gotta be honest."
00:12:16.110,00:12:17.640,"We gotta close these doors really quick"
00:12:17.640,00:12:18.940,"before they get mad at me."
00:12:20.730,00:12:22.350,"- [Derek] At 9:00 AM the next morning,"
00:12:22.350,00:12:24.510,"the smelting is complete."
00:12:24.510,00:12:28.230,"A total of 614 kilograms of iron sand"
00:12:28.230,00:12:32.193,"and 670 kilograms of charcoal were added to the smelter."
00:12:33.930,00:12:36.000,"At this point, in a traditional smelter,"
00:12:36.000,00:12:37.590,"the only way to get the steel out"
00:12:37.590,00:12:38.973,"would be to break it apart."
00:12:42.270,00:12:44.190,"These days, a crane is used"
00:12:44.190,00:12:45.729,"to take the smelter apart."
00:12:45.729,00:12:47.388,"- [Petr] Oh wow, okay."
00:12:47.388,00:12:48.221,"Oh!"
00:12:51.030,00:12:53.970,"- [Derek] And what is left to show for all that hard work"
00:12:53.970,00:12:58.590,"is a 100 kilogram block of steel, iron, and slag."
00:12:58.590,00:13:01.770,"Only around a third of this block is high enough quality"
00:13:01.770,00:13:03.470,"to be used in sword making."
00:13:03.470,00:13:06.120,"(crane whirs and clunks)"
00:13:06.120,00:13:09.900,"- Oh, that's insane. That's so cool."
00:13:09.900,00:13:11.913,"The result for all the hard work."
00:13:15.750,00:13:19.614,"This is step one of making a Japanese sword."
00:13:19.614,00:13:21.060,"(subdued music)"
00:13:21.060,00:13:24.000,"- [Derek] The steel is sorted by quality and carbon content,"
00:13:24.000,00:13:26.070,"which is also done by eye,"
00:13:26.070,00:13:28.470,"in fact, this is one of the exams you need to pass"
00:13:28.470,00:13:30.393,"to be certified as a swordsmith."
00:13:31.320,00:13:33.540,"Then, the different grades of steel are sent out"
00:13:33.540,00:13:36.990,"to one of 300 swordsmiths around the country."
00:13:36.990,00:13:40.020,"Only 30 do it as their full-time job,"
00:13:40.020,00:13:42.810,"and one of them is Akihara Kokaji,"
00:13:42.810,00:13:44.880,"who we went to visit next."
00:13:44.880,00:13:48.000,"This is when the forging of the sword begins."
00:13:48.000,00:13:50.400,"In a coal oven with hand-pumped bellows,"
00:13:50.400,00:13:53.403,"the steel is heated until it is soft and malleable."
00:13:54.720,00:13:56.040,"Then using hammers,"
00:13:56.040,00:13:58.803,"the master swordsmith flattens out the steel."
00:13:59.850,00:14:02.580,"In the old days, this would've been done by the swordsmith"
00:14:02.580,00:14:04.140,"and three apprentices."
00:14:04.140,00:14:07.350,"The swordsmith using a smaller hammer, would set the rhythm"
00:14:07.350,00:14:09.600,"and the apprentices would use big mallets"
00:14:09.600,00:14:10.923,"to flatten the steel."
00:14:12.673,00:14:17.673,"(hammers clank) (Petr grunts)"
00:14:18.910,00:14:21.160,"- Woo. That was terrifying."
00:14:23.010,00:14:25.773,"- [Derek] These days, electric hammers are used."
00:14:33.690,00:14:35.583,"When the steel is flat enough,"
00:14:36.750,00:14:38.883,"it is then bent back on itself,"
00:14:44.785,00:14:48.037,"(fire crackles)"
00:14:48.037,00:14:49.320,"and it is then hammered again"
00:14:49.320,00:14:52.263,"to press the steel back together into a solid block."
00:14:53.813,00:14:57.030,"(gentle music)"
00:14:57.030,00:14:59.730,"So why go to all this effort flattening the steel,"
00:14:59.730,00:15:01.650,"only to fold it back on itself"
00:15:01.650,00:15:04.893,"and end up with a chunk of steel the same size as before?"
00:15:06.240,00:15:09.840,"Well, because folding does two very important things."
00:15:09.840,00:15:12.030,"First, it spreads out the impurities"
00:15:12.030,00:15:14.700,"like silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus."
00:15:14.700,00:15:16.890,"It spreads them out throughout the steel."
00:15:16.890,00:15:21.660,"This ensures a uniform consistency without any weak points."
00:15:21.660,00:15:24.630,"Second, it gives the steel a grain."
00:15:24.630,00:15:27.330,"After folding the sword, it is now reinforced"
00:15:27.330,00:15:30.540,"in the direction that it will be hit in combat,"
00:15:30.540,00:15:33.750,"and as a bonus, the steel is exposed to the air."
00:15:33.750,00:15:35.220,"So there is a small amount"
00:15:35.220,00:15:38.640,"of oxidation creating a darker colored steel,"
00:15:38.640,00:15:41.763,"which when folded makes beautiful patterns."
00:15:42.990,00:15:47.220,"There are some swords which have more than a billion layers."
00:15:47.220,00:15:48.480,"Now this doesn't mean the sword"
00:15:48.480,00:15:50.610,"has been folded a billion times"
00:15:50.610,00:15:53.670,"since every fold doubles the number of layers,"
00:15:53.670,00:15:58.290,"so you only need about 30 folds to get a billion layers."
00:15:58.290,00:16:01.770,"But usually a sword is folded 10 to 13 times,"
00:16:01.770,00:16:04.863,"resulting in a few thousand layers of steel."
00:16:05.850,00:16:09.060,"Now a blade isn't made from a single block of steel."
00:16:09.060,00:16:12.180,"The carbon content affects how hard the steel is."
00:16:12.180,00:16:13.830,"So different carbon percentages"
00:16:13.830,00:16:16.443,"are used in different parts of the blade."
00:16:17.430,00:16:20.460,"Because carbon atoms are much smaller than iron atoms,"
00:16:20.460,00:16:23.850,"they can fit inside the crystal lattice of iron."
00:16:23.850,00:16:25.500,"These trapped carbon atoms"
00:16:25.500,00:16:27.990,"then apply an outward force to the lattice"
00:16:27.990,00:16:30.270,"putting the steel under stress."
00:16:30.270,00:16:32.040,"The higher the carbon percentage,"
00:16:32.040,00:16:34.950,"the harder and more rigid the steel."
00:16:34.950,00:16:37.230,"But this hardness comes at a cost."
00:16:37.230,00:16:38.850,"The steel becomes brittle,"
00:16:38.850,00:16:42.753,"making it more likely to chip and shatter rather than bend."
00:16:44.490,00:16:46.440,"So what swordsmiths do"
00:16:46.440,00:16:49.110,"is they use steel with different carbon contents"
00:16:49.110,00:16:51.120,"for different parts of the blade."
00:16:51.120,00:16:53.490,"The edge is always high carbon steel"
00:16:53.490,00:16:54.960,"to make it hard and rigid"
00:16:54.960,00:16:58.170,"so it can maintain a sharp edge for a long time."
00:16:58.170,00:17:01.050,"But the spine is usually made of lower-carbon steel,"
00:17:01.050,00:17:03.753,"which allows the sword to flex without breaking."
00:17:04.590,00:17:07.590,"This is done by welding together pieces of steel"
00:17:07.590,00:17:09.633,"with different carbon contents."
00:17:10.620,00:17:13.830,"- So we have about a 15-minute break"
00:17:13.830,00:17:16.500,"because you know it takes a while for the iron"
00:17:16.500,00:17:18.990,"to heat up and then meld together,"
00:17:18.990,00:17:20.910,"and then we're back in there."
00:17:20.910,00:17:23.610,"It's very hot. It's very, very hot in there."
00:17:23.610,00:17:25.470,"It's kind of unbelievable"
00:17:25.470,00:17:27.720,"that he can do this for four hours at a time."
00:17:28.710,00:17:31.110,"- [Derek] After the sword is hammered into shape,"
00:17:31.110,00:17:35.880,"which is a straight blade, it is covered in a layer of clay,"
00:17:35.880,00:17:37.740,"a thick layer for the spine,"
00:17:37.740,00:17:40.200,"and a thin layer for the blade itself."
00:17:40.200,00:17:42.030,"It's then heated in the furnace"
00:17:42.030,00:17:44.610,"and then rapidly cooled in water,"
00:17:44.610,00:17:46.353,"a process known as quenching."
00:17:47.280,00:17:50.130,"Now, because the layers of clay have different thicknesses,"
00:17:50.130,00:17:54.093,"the rate of cooling is faster for the edge than the spine."
00:17:55.080,00:17:59.190,"When the steel is heated, carbon enters the iron lattice,"
00:17:59.190,00:18:02.100,"and since the spine of the sword is covered in thick clay,"
00:18:02.100,00:18:03.870,"it will cool slowly,"
00:18:03.870,00:18:07.500,"giving time for the carbon atoms to leave the iron matrix."
00:18:07.500,00:18:11.280,"This will lead to a very low-carbon steel called ferrite,"
00:18:11.280,00:18:13.470,"but the carbon atoms which have left the matrix"
00:18:13.470,00:18:15.480,"will be caught by other iron atoms"
00:18:15.480,00:18:18.390,"and created a type of steel known as cementite."
00:18:18.390,00:18:20.610,"The combination of ferrite and cementite"
00:18:20.610,00:18:22.140,"is known as perlite,"
00:18:22.140,00:18:25.500,"and it's a mostly soft and ductile form of steel,"
00:18:25.500,00:18:28.860,"though parts of it are hard due to the cementite."
00:18:28.860,00:18:32.640,"So per light forms the spine of the sword."
00:18:32.640,00:18:35.400,"In contrast, the very thin layer of clay on the blade"
00:18:35.400,00:18:37.830,"means that it cools very rapidly,"
00:18:37.830,00:18:41.010,"so more of the carbon is trapped in the lattice."
00:18:41.010,00:18:42.600,"This forces the lattice structure"
00:18:42.600,00:18:45.690,"to change from cubic to tetragonal"
00:18:45.690,00:18:49.080,"making a form of steel known as martensite."
00:18:49.080,00:18:52.050,"Since the trapped carbon puts stress on the lattice,"
00:18:52.050,00:18:54.540,"martensite is incredibly hard,"
00:18:54.540,00:18:57.183,"exactly what you'd want for the edge of a sword."
00:19:00.330,00:19:02.460,"The tetragonal lattice structure of martensite"
00:19:02.460,00:19:04.170,"also takes up more space"
00:19:04.170,00:19:07.290,"so the edge of the blade expands relative to the spine,"
00:19:07.290,00:19:09.390,"curving the sword backwards."
00:19:09.390,00:19:11.760,"The iconic curve of a samurai sword"
00:19:11.760,00:19:14.643,"comes from the formation of martensite."
00:19:15.750,00:19:17.340,"You can actually see the boundary"
00:19:17.340,00:19:20.520,"between different types of steel in a finished sword"
00:19:20.520,00:19:22.650,"by the difference in color."
00:19:22.650,00:19:27.650,"This is known as hamon, which literally means edge pattern."
00:19:28.897,00:19:31.530,"- At the Victoria Albert Museum in London,"
00:19:31.530,00:19:33.300,"there is a Japanese sword"
00:19:33.300,00:19:36.090,"that has a very detailed little dragon in the hamon,"
00:19:36.090,00:19:37.470,"and I've looked at it many times."
00:19:37.470,00:19:40.980,"I don't, okay, I don't know how he did that. (laughs)"
00:19:40.980,00:19:43.260,"- [Derek] About one third of all blades"
00:19:43.260,00:19:46.110,"shatter during the quenching process."
00:19:46.110,00:19:47.400,"- You quench it once"
00:19:47.400,00:19:50.640,"and you thank the stars that you made it."
00:19:50.640,00:19:52.950,"- [Derek] The sword is then placed back in the forage"
00:19:52.950,00:19:55.740,"to evaporate any remaining water."
00:19:55.740,00:19:57.600,"This also provides a little bit of energy"
00:19:57.600,00:19:59.880,"to loosen some of the crystal structures"
00:19:59.880,00:20:01.830,"making the sword less brittle."
00:20:01.830,00:20:03.090,"- And that's about the extent"
00:20:03.090,00:20:06.330,"of the tempering process on a Japanese sword,"
00:20:06.330,00:20:08.670,"which that that might be enough to relax things a bit,"
00:20:08.670,00:20:11.430,"but they kept the edge much harder"
00:20:11.430,00:20:13.023,"than you would've in the West."
00:20:13.950,00:20:15.360,"- [Derek] After the sword is forged,"
00:20:15.360,00:20:17.370,"it is sent to a polisher."
00:20:17.370,00:20:19.530,"The polishing and sharpening of a sword"
00:20:19.530,00:20:21.450,"is also done by hand"
00:20:21.450,00:20:24.690,"with whetstones of different coarsenesses."
00:20:24.690,00:20:29.250,"It can take a month to sharpen and polish a single sword."
00:20:29.250,00:20:31.920,"- One of the things that I love is that like,"
00:20:31.920,00:20:33.780,"this table is sloping down"
00:20:33.780,00:20:36.630,"and the entire floor over there is sloping down."
00:20:36.630,00:20:38.730,"So when you like add the water,"
00:20:38.730,00:20:40.770,"all of the residue and all the water,"
00:20:40.770,00:20:43.893,"you know, flows downhill so it's not perfectly flat."
00:20:43.893,00:20:46.050,"(hammer taps softly)"
00:20:46.050,00:20:47.070,"- [Derek] Sometimes the swords"
00:20:47.070,00:20:49.740,"are also engraved with beautiful patterns,"
00:20:49.740,00:20:51.573,"though this is quite rare."
00:20:54.630,00:20:57.483,"And after all that, the sword is done."
00:20:59.190,00:21:01.320,"To learn how to use a Japanese sword,"
00:21:01.320,00:21:05.880,"Petr got a lesson from a master, Takara Takanashi."
00:21:05.880,00:21:08.280,"He is the 10th-generation student"
00:21:08.280,00:21:11.763,"of Miyamoto Musashi, a legendary samurai."
00:21:12.990,00:21:16.200,"Musashi killed his first opponent in single combat"
00:21:16.200,00:21:18.450,"at the age of 13."
00:21:18.450,00:21:21.420,"He spent the rest of his life perfecting his sword-fighting,"
00:21:21.420,00:21:24.900,"inventing a new technique with two swords."
00:21:24.900,00:21:28.290,"Musashi fought in more than 60 duels to the death,"
00:21:28.290,00:21:30.802,"and he won every last one of them."
00:21:30.802,00:21:32.677,"(serious music)"
00:21:32.677,00:21:33.720,"(subdued music)"
00:21:33.720,00:21:35.400,"There is a story about a duel"
00:21:35.400,00:21:37.800,"that took place during a snowstorm."
00:21:37.800,00:21:40.860,"As he faced his opponent, katana outstretched,"
00:21:40.860,00:21:44.310,"Musashi was so calm and kept his sword so still"
00:21:44.310,00:21:46.500,"that snowflakes began to accumulate"
00:21:46.500,00:21:48.543,"on the thin edge of the blade."
00:21:51.330,00:21:52.350,"- [Petr] So during the lesson,"
00:21:52.350,00:21:55.050,"I thought I would get to use a katana,"
00:21:55.050,00:21:57.600,"but instead we spent the entire time"
00:21:57.600,00:21:59.940,"learning how to take the blade out of its sheath"
00:21:59.940,00:22:01.143,"and then put it back in."
00:22:04.470,00:22:07.710,"So when I actually got the chance to use a katana"
00:22:07.710,00:22:11.673,"to slice through some things, I was deeply unprepared."
00:22:13.756,00:22:16.339,"(katana thuds)"
00:22:17.668,00:22:20.130,"(playful music)"
00:22:20.130,00:22:22.655,"- [Producer] Well, it looks like it's your turn."
00:22:22.655,00:22:23.822,"I'm so scared."
00:22:24.970,00:22:27.000,"Okay, so this has been an amazing day."
00:22:27.000,00:22:29.070,"We've looked at some beautiful katanas,"
00:22:29.070,00:22:31.680,"and now these wonderful people are letting me use one"
00:22:31.680,00:22:35.610,"of their just unbelievably beautiful pieces of art"
00:22:35.610,00:22:37.195,"to chop some things."
00:22:37.195,00:22:40.927,"(Petr exhales forcefully)"
00:22:40.927,00:22:43.738,"(katana thuds) - Oh."
00:22:43.738,00:22:44.571,"Oh."
00:22:44.571,00:22:45.404,"- Woo!"
00:22:46.657,00:22:49.233,"Like this is kind of the best day ever."
00:22:50.805,00:22:53.220,"(subdued music)"
00:22:53.220,00:22:55.230,"- [Derek] There really is something remarkable"
00:22:55.230,00:22:56.970,"about Japanese swords."
00:22:56.970,00:22:59.700,"The amount of care, attention, and expertise"
00:22:59.700,00:23:01.500,"that each step requires,"
00:23:01.500,00:23:03.930,"from the gathering and refining of the iron sand"
00:23:03.930,00:23:04.763,"to the smelting,"
00:23:04.763,00:23:07.380,"to the forging and sharpening a sword,"
00:23:07.380,00:23:10.680,"each step takes so much time and skill."
00:23:10.680,00:23:13.260,"It's incredible that all these things were discovered"
00:23:13.260,00:23:17.610,"by trial and error to produce artifacts of such high quality"
00:23:17.610,00:23:20.603,"that they are still prized centuries later."
00:23:20.603,00:23:22.925,"(steelworkers speaking Japanese)"
00:23:22.925,00:23:25.680,"(steelworkers clap)"
00:23:25.680,00:23:27.120,"- [Derek] Before I made this video,"
00:23:27.120,00:23:28.530,"I didn't really appreciate"
00:23:28.530,00:23:31.140,"that swords can be art."
00:23:31.140,00:23:33.480,"To me, it's a good reminder that whatever you do,"
00:23:33.480,00:23:36.480,"you should do it with deep care, attention to detail,"
00:23:36.480,00:23:38.127,"and love for the craft."
00:23:38.127,00:23:40.980,"(both speaking Japanese)"
00:23:40.980,00:23:42.630,"- Do that enough times"
00:23:42.630,00:23:45.333,"and you might just make something beautiful."
00:23:46.731,00:23:50.670,"(audio chimes and warbles)"
00:23:50.670,00:23:51.810,"Hey, this part of the video"
00:23:51.810,00:23:54.450,"was brought to you by Henson Shaving."
00:23:54.450,00:23:57.000,"You know, making high quality things is hard,"
00:23:57.000,00:23:58.260,"and as far as I'm concerned,"
00:23:58.260,00:24:01.740,"Henson make the highest-quality razors in the world,"
00:24:01.740,00:24:04.470,"the katanas of the shaving world, if you will."
00:24:04.470,00:24:07.170,"I've been using their AL-13 razor for the last year,"
00:24:07.170,00:24:10.590,"and it's the best razor I've used by a long margin."
00:24:10.590,00:24:11.700,"One of the reasons for that"
00:24:11.700,00:24:14.940,"is Henson really understands the physics of shaving,"
00:24:14.940,00:24:18.030,"because as aerospace machinists for 20 years,"
00:24:18.030,00:24:20.430,"they understand how to cut things effectively."
00:24:20.430,00:24:22.320,"They get precision."
00:24:22.320,00:24:25.170,"Human hair is much harder than the skin it's growing out of,"
00:24:25.170,00:24:27.390,"and as a result, typical razors drag"
00:24:27.390,00:24:29.460,"and pull on the hair while cutting."
00:24:29.460,00:24:31.980,"What a multi-blade razor does is it assumes"
00:24:31.980,00:24:33.810,"that the first cut will be ineffective,"
00:24:33.810,00:24:36.450,"and so they build in extra blades to cut the hair"
00:24:36.450,00:24:38.670,"before it can snap back into position."
00:24:38.670,00:24:40.530,"And that does result in a good cut,"
00:24:40.530,00:24:42.750,"but it also increases friction"
00:24:42.750,00:24:45.540,"leading to razor burn and skin irritation."
00:24:45.540,00:24:47.490,"Henson carefully studied that problem"
00:24:47.490,00:24:50.040,"and realized that you didn't need to add extra blades,"
00:24:50.040,00:24:53.430,"you just needed to properly support a single blade."
00:24:53.430,00:24:55.290,"Virtually every razor on allows"
00:24:55.290,00:24:59.010,"for too much play in the blade, but Henson doesn't."
00:24:59.010,00:25:00.660,"The result is an effective cut"
00:25:00.660,00:25:03.300,"without the additional friction on your skin."
00:25:03.300,00:25:05.850,"Seriously, a Henson is truly a great razor."
00:25:05.850,00:25:07.530,"It'll last you a lifetime."
00:25:07.530,00:25:09.720,"You will get a better shave with less irritation,"
00:25:09.720,00:25:12.030,"and you'll also save money in the long run."
00:25:12.030,00:25:15.120,"So head over to hensonshaving.com/veritasium"
