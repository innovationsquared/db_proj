00:00:00.030,00:00:03.200,"Now, you may have seen this thumbnail on YouTube."
00:00:03.200,00:00:05.343,"I mean, I can actually basically guarantee"
00:00:05.343,00:00:07.800,"that YouTube has been shoving this in your face"
00:00:07.800,00:00:10.680,"like, ""Click! Click! Click it again!"""
00:00:10.680,00:00:12.640,"So you might be wondering why."
00:00:12.640,00:00:16.120,"Why did this video in particular go viral?"
00:00:16.120,00:00:19.720,"Well, that is what I'm gonna set out to explain in this video"
00:00:19.720,00:00:22.960,"but I'm gonna start with something that seems unrelated,"
00:00:23.960,00:00:26.040,"which is YouTuber burnout."
00:00:26.120,00:00:30.720,"Now, there's no secret, there have been a lot of YouTubers recently talking about burnout:"
00:00:30.720,00:00:34.700,"people like Casey Neistat, Superwoman, Ryan Higa, Grace Helbig,"
00:00:34.740,00:00:37.760,"and many, many, MANY more,"
00:00:37.760,00:00:40.840,"and I think, when you have all of these people"
00:00:40.840,00:00:45.400,"with different YouTube channels, different experiences, they're all saying something similar;"
00:00:45.400,00:00:51.480,"I think it's worth understanding that there may be sort of a common factor at play amongst all of them."
00:00:51.480,00:00:57.040,"So what I'm actually gonna present is a kind of theory of everything when it comes to YouTube;"
00:00:57.040,00:01:01.320,"everything from YouTuber burnout, through to videos going viral;"
00:01:01.320,00:01:04.600,"why do videos go viral on the platform right now."
00:01:04.600,00:01:09.160,"Okay, so, you know, I think as a viewer your response to burnout might be to say,"
00:01:09.160,00:01:11.960,"""Well these YouTubers are just entitled"" or, ""They're soft"""
00:01:11.960,00:01:15.040,"or, you know, ""Boohoo, you have the best job in the world"""
00:01:15.040,00:01:19.200,"or your other response might be that burnout happens in every industry,"
00:01:19.200,00:01:21.120,"so why should we care about this YouTuber thing,"
00:01:21.120,00:01:25.280,"but I think that YouTuber burnout is a more specific phenomenon;"
00:01:25.280,00:01:28.200,"I think there's something particular going on here."
00:01:28.200,00:01:32.560,"and it all starts with the YouTuber life cycle."
00:01:32.560,00:01:35.440,"I mean, if you think about a YouTuber who's complaining about burnout,"
00:01:35.440,00:01:38.120,"you know they've had some success on the platform"
00:01:38.120,00:01:41.080,"where their views are rising - and of course that's exhilarating,"
00:01:41.080,00:01:46.360,"it feels great and you're working pretty hard, but you're seeing it pay off,"
00:01:46.360,00:01:50.080,"and then at some point your views start to falter"
00:01:50.080,00:01:54.200,"so maybe you work a little bit harder but things don't really change"
00:01:54.200,00:01:57.240,"and-and the views, you know, continue to fall."
00:01:57.240,00:02:00.840,"I think there's a certain thing to do with the psychology of anchoring here."
00:02:00.840,00:02:04.000,"You know, once you have a certain number of subscribers,"
00:02:04.000,00:02:07.720,"then, you know, a hundred thousand views which might be amazing in the beginning"
00:02:07.720,00:02:10.080,"feels like a horrible disappointment."
00:02:10.080,00:02:14.600,"So there's a real problem between sort of expectations and reality,"
00:02:14.600,00:02:18.880,"and to me, this is a big part of why YouTuber burnout happens."
00:02:19.280,00:02:23.040,"Now, if you look at what the YouTubers are saying about this,"
00:02:23.040,00:02:27.360,"you find that a lot of them are taking responsibility themselves,"
00:02:27.360,00:02:31.800,"and they're also making some clear cause-and-effect relationships,"
00:02:31.800,00:02:36.000,"which you know this kind of seemed to make sense:"
00:02:36.000,00:02:41.600,"okay, so this idea we assume that views reflect something about video quality,"
00:02:41.600,00:02:43.520,"we kind of make that assumption,"
00:02:43.520,00:02:48.120,"and so when there are, you know, fewer views taking place,"
00:02:48.120,00:02:49.960,"that means the video is lower quality."
00:02:49.960,00:02:52.572,"This is just kind of, I think, instinctive,"
00:02:52.572,00:02:54.400,"but I want to question that."
00:02:54.400,00:02:58.120,"I also want to question these YouTubers who essentially put the blame on themselves"
00:02:58.120,00:03:02.000,"and say, you know, they're just not making as good videos anymore"
00:03:02.000,00:03:05.000,"to me I think there's something else at play,"
00:03:05.000,00:03:07.800,"and it is the system."
00:03:07.920,00:03:10.860,"So, from time to time, I like to go over to Google Trends,"
00:03:10.920,00:03:13.320,"where you can basically search any search term"
00:03:13.320,00:03:17.720,"and see how much traffic there is, how many people are searching that term at any given time,"
00:03:17.720,00:03:22.200,"and if you search for ""Veritasium"" basically since 2004"
00:03:22.200,00:03:25.200,"you see, well,  this kind of curve,"
00:03:25.200,00:03:27.520,"which might make you ask the question:"
00:03:27.520,00:03:31.480,"""Where on the YouTuber life cycle do you think I am?"","
00:03:31.480,00:03:34.280,"and of course this little spike here is from my black hole videos,"
00:03:34.280,00:03:38.800,"this over here must be some Harry Potter fans who are bad at spelling."
00:03:38.800,00:03:40.800,"So this is how much people are searching for me,"
00:03:40.800,00:03:45.720,"which I think kind of correlates to how much my videos are being shown on YouTube,"
00:03:45.720,00:03:47.840,"and how much people are watching them and enjoying them."
00:03:47.840,00:03:54.080,"Now let's look at a similar channel for comparison. How about the channel Numberphile?"
00:03:54.080,00:03:56.040,"It's also an educational channel,"
00:03:56.040,00:03:59.720,"but it's, uh, you know, very diff- made by very different people"
00:03:59.720,00:04:02.360,"with very different schedules, very different topics that we've tackled,"
00:04:02.360,00:04:05.200,"and yet these graphs look pretty similar,"
00:04:05.200,00:04:07.160,"Uhh, let me have a look at one more."
00:04:07.760,00:04:11.000,"So this is the AsapSCIENCE curve."
00:04:11.720,00:04:17.600,"So here you have Veritasium, Numberphile, and AsapSCIENCE: three educational YouTube channels,"
00:04:17.600,00:04:22.480,"which all follow a fairly similar pattern on Google Trends."
00:04:23.280,00:04:28.920,"So my question is: You know, why is this? Why should we follow a similar trend?"
00:04:28.920,00:04:31.760,"Well, the obvious answer is the algorithm."
00:04:32.840,00:04:35.160,"And the algorithm has a very important job,"
00:04:35.160,00:04:39.480,"because in traditional media, there are not that many works produced."
00:04:39.480,00:04:43.880,"I mean, in American theaters last year, there were about 800 films."
00:04:44.360,00:04:45.600,"800 films. That's it."
00:04:45.600,00:04:49.400,"On TV there were 500 scripted TV shows."
00:04:49.400,00:04:53.040,"But when it comes to YouTube, it doesn't even compare."
00:04:53.040,00:05:00.120,"I mean, I don't even think that they advertise the number of hundreds of hours uploaded every minute."
00:05:00.120,00:05:04.520,"The obvious analogy is that you're really just seeing the tip of the iceberg,"
00:05:04.520,00:05:08.840,"but in the case of icebergs, you see, you know, almost 10% of the ice above the surface."
00:05:08.840,00:05:14.360,"In the case of YouTube you're seeing just (the tip of)x5 of the iceberg"
00:05:14.360,00:05:18.880,"basically, statistically speaking, you are ignorant of everything on YouTube."
00:05:19.320,00:05:26.760,"And yet, YouTube claims that they have this algorithm, which you can think of, like, the brain of the platform"
00:05:26.760,00:05:31.040,"that can connect an audience (that knows almost nothing of what's on the platform),"
00:05:31.040,00:05:34.320,"to the particular types of content they like."
00:05:35.040,00:05:42.480,"And in the best case, they would argue, YouTube would argue, that the algorithm is basically the audience."
00:05:42.840,00:05:47.520,"You know, the audience decides what they want to watch and-and the algorithm is just reflecting that,"
00:05:47.520,00:05:50.680,"but of course, we are not in this ideal world,"
00:05:50.680,00:05:54.560,"and the audience itself is always kind of shifting"
00:05:54.560,00:05:58.000,"and changing who they are and what they like to watch,"
00:05:58.000,00:06:01.960,"and so, the algorithm, you can think of as following the audience"
00:06:01.960,00:06:07.280,"the algorithm is-is chasing this audience around and trying to reach them."
00:06:07.280,00:06:10.520,"Now, what YouTube doesn't much consider, is that"
00:06:10.520,00:06:17.360,"well, the YouTube creators use their content to try to chase the algorithm."
00:06:17.360,00:06:20.240,"So these YouTubers who would love to be creating content about,"
00:06:20.240,00:06:23.040,"you know, whatever they're most passionate about in whatever way"
00:06:23.040,00:06:29.000,"they also see what's popular on the site and they try to make content that will please the algorithm."
00:06:29.000,00:06:33.800,"And so there's a way in which the content is chasing the algorithm, the algorithm is chasing the audience,"
00:06:33.800,00:06:37.720,"and if the content actually manages to catch up with the algorithm,"
00:06:37.720,00:06:40.800,"you get a-a kind of perverse situation,"
00:06:40.800,00:06:44.600,"in which the algorithm is the content."
00:06:45.680,00:06:46.180," "
00:06:46.180,00:06:47.520,"I mean, what do I mean by that?"
00:06:47.520,00:06:52.040,"Just a crazy thought experiment: if YouTube wanted more videos of snails,"
00:06:52.040,00:06:53.160,"they could make that happen;"
00:06:53.160,00:06:55.160,"they don't actually have to go out and make any snail videos,"
00:06:55.160,00:06:58.360,"if they just, you know, promoted videos with snail in the title,"
00:06:58.360,00:07:01.160,"tomorrow there's gonna be a whole bunch on the front page and trending and then"
00:07:01.160,00:07:04.760,"creators be like, ""Oh snails are the new thing!"", and they're going to go make a bunch of videos about snails."
00:07:05.160,00:07:09.940,"YouTube would love to believe that-that creators don't care about the algorithm - but they do!"
00:07:09.940,00:07:15.400,"It's like the core aspect of how creators decide what content to make."
00:07:15.400,00:07:19.120,"Just as a more, uh, down-to-earth example,"
00:07:19.920,00:07:25.400,"I can show you a graph of the length of my videos from 2011, through to today."
00:07:25.400,00:07:31.120,"And what you see is, at the beginning, uh, all of my videos averaged about 2 or 3 minutes in length,"
00:07:31.120,00:07:36.520,"but these days, I'm fast approaching an average length of video of 10 minutes."
00:07:37.040,00:07:40.760,"Now, YouTube never came to me and said, ""Derek, you have to make longer videos"";"
00:07:40.760,00:07:47.480,"all they said was, well videos that are longer and get longer watch time will be promoted more on the site,"
00:07:48.000,00:07:52.120,"so, people like myself and, you know, all the other creators who wanted to be seen,"
00:07:52.120,00:07:54.760,"we made longer videos. It's just, what we did."
00:07:56.000,00:07:59.280,"Now, we know that the algorithm is always changing;"
00:07:59.280,00:08:01.760,"they're always trying to optimize it make it work better,"
00:08:01.760,00:08:05.560,"but they also change what it's trying to optimize for."
00:08:05.560,00:08:07.960,"In the beginning it was simple: just views,"
00:08:07.960,00:08:12.440,"but they quickly figured out that, of course, like, a 20 minute view is worth a lot more than a 5 second view,"
00:08:12.440,00:08:15.520,"so the actual metric should be watch time."
00:08:15.520,00:08:18.400,"And this, uh, was advantageous to people like gamers,"
00:08:18.400,00:08:21.640,"because people like to watch people play video games for long periods of time."
00:08:21.640,00:08:23.680,"They also reduced the latency of the algorithm,"
00:08:23.680,00:08:28.000,"by which I mean it updates every 10 minutes instead of, say, every day,"
00:08:28.000,00:08:32.040,"and that's beneficial for news content and things that are really time-sensitive,"
00:08:32.040,00:08:38.760,"and to me as a YouTuber what this means is it's impossible to be an expert on YouTube."
00:08:38.760,00:08:42.600,"If you look at what it takes to become an expert at anything,"
00:08:42.600,00:08:45.840,"according to the Nobel prize-winning economist Daniel Kahneman,"
00:08:45.840,00:08:50.560,"you need, of course, many, many hours of practice. Effortful, deliberate practice."
00:08:50.560,00:08:53.560,"And on YouTube I would argue we get that."
00:08:53.560,00:08:56.360,"You also need timely feedback,"
00:08:56.360,00:09:03.000,"and, again, on YouTube we're given plenty of tools to be able to see how our videos are performing;"
00:09:03.000,00:09:06.400,"but, when it comes to a reliable environment -"
00:09:06.400,00:09:10.560,"this is an environment in which the rules of the game aren't changing:"
00:09:10.560,00:09:12.160,"so you can think of something like chess"
00:09:12.160,00:09:14.280,"it's possible to be a chess expert,"
00:09:14.280,00:09:18.840,"because in the middle of a game of chess, the rules don't suddenly change on you."
00:09:18.840,00:09:21.600,"Now, on YouTube, that is not true."
00:09:21.600,00:09:24.220,"We are not playing by the same rules the whole time,"
00:09:24.220,00:09:26.720,"because the algorithm is constantly changing."
00:09:26.720,00:09:31.280,"And so, that puts us in this position, where it's kind of impossible to be experts,"
00:09:31.280,00:09:36.080,"and instead we're a little bit more like [page flips], caged pigeons."
00:09:36.080,00:09:37.360,"Okay, go with me on this."
00:09:37.360,00:09:41.880,"Uh, there was this famous experiment where, you know, pigeons were put in a cage with a lever"
00:09:41.880,00:09:45.320,"and if they push the lever then they would get some food,"
00:09:45.320,00:09:49.640,"and so they very quickly learned that they needed to push the lever and the food would come out,"
00:09:49.640,00:09:50.960,"so that's fine."
00:09:50.960,00:09:56.600,"But in a another part of the experiment they disconnected, the lever from the food output"
00:09:56.600,00:10:00.480,"and they just supplied food into the cage, kind of, at random"
00:10:01.000,00:10:02.680,"and what did the pigeons do?"
00:10:03.280,00:10:07.920,"Well, they started to do the types of behaviors that they were doing when the food appeared,"
00:10:07.920,00:10:11.840,"so, if one was preening itself then it would keep preening itself,"
00:10:11.840,00:10:13.440,"with the expectation that food was coming,"
00:10:13.440,00:10:16.360,"and this one, maybe he was pecking the ground;"
00:10:16.360,00:10:20.960,"so, the point being they started to engage in these superstitious behaviors,"
00:10:20.960,00:10:23.760,"um, because they had related some sort of cause and effect,"
00:10:23.760,00:10:26.280,"but there actually wasn't a cause and effect there,"
00:10:26.280,00:10:30.440,"and to me, this partly explains the whole YouTube burnout phenomenon,"
00:10:30.440,00:10:34.600,"because you have these creators who are stretching themselves to try to chase that algorithm"
00:10:34.600,00:10:36.720,"meanwhile the algorithm is constantly shifting"
00:10:36.720,00:10:39.840,"and so you never feel like an expert and never quite know what's going on"
00:10:39.840,00:10:43.040,"even though you're constantly trying to relate cause and effect"
00:10:43.040,00:10:45.520,"now I can understand why the algorithm has to change."
00:10:45.520,00:10:51.000,"I mean in the early days of YouTube, it was this situation where if you had subscribers you were golden"
00:10:51.000,00:10:53.560,"because the next time you uploaded some content"
00:10:53.560,00:10:56.680,"then YouTube would show it to all your subscribers it'll get a ton of views"
00:10:56.680,00:11:01.400,"YouTube would say ""oh this is a popular video"", show it to even more people, getting you even more subscribers"
00:11:01.400,00:11:05.880,"so the next time you launch another video then it goes to more subscribers more views"
00:11:05.880,00:11:09.640,"and it was just this positive feedback loop where you would grow and grow and grow a channel"
00:11:09.640,00:11:13.040,"so the rich got richer and small channels stayed small"
00:11:13.040,00:11:15.640,"so obviously we needed something to break the cycle"
00:11:15.640,00:11:18.760,"and so YouTube started doing some experiments"
00:11:18.760,00:11:24.440,"where they would essentially change what was recommended to your audience"
00:11:24.440,00:11:28.520,"so they would stop showing some of the content from certain subscribers"
00:11:28.520,00:11:30.920,"and they saw what happened to views"
00:11:30.920,00:11:35.440,"so they started disconnecting these subscribers from the channel"
00:11:35.440,00:11:39.200,"No longer was a subscription like ""I want to see every video by this person"""
00:11:39.200,00:11:45.880,"it was more of a suggestion that maybe something this person creates is something I might like to see"
00:11:45.880,00:11:48.200,"and what YouTube found when they did that"
00:11:48.200,00:11:54.040,"was that the number of views on the platform the amount of watch time all rose dramatically"
00:11:54.040,00:12:01.440,"so for YouTube to get growth of the site they found that reducing the importance of subscriptions was essential"
00:12:01.440,00:12:03.160,"and this kind of makes sense if you think about it"
00:12:03.160,00:12:05.200,"I mean if you make one great video,"
00:12:05.200,00:12:08.880,"that doesn't necessarily mean that every video you're gonna make is gonna be great"
00:12:08.880,00:12:10.760,"so it makes sense for YouTube to step in"
00:12:10.760,00:12:16.200,"and play some role in terms of determining what gets shown to which audience members"
00:12:16.200,00:12:20.320,"Now, as has been observed by MatPat previously,"
00:12:20.320,00:12:27.040,"moving away from subscriptions moves YouTube back to what it was like to sell newspapers on the street"
00:12:27.040,00:12:30.400,"you really had to inspire people to buy on the spot"
00:12:30.400,00:12:35.160,"you have to serve up really sensational news items. This is also called yellow journalism."
00:12:35.160,00:12:38.520,"it was only once the newspapers built subscription models"
00:12:38.520,00:12:44.880,"that newspapers could make sober journalism a reality, something that they focused on"
00:12:44.880,00:12:48.920,"because they already had your eyeballs, they didn't have to fight for that sort of attention"
00:12:48.920,00:12:51.120,"they didn't have to be as sensational"
00:12:51.120,00:12:54.040,"but YouTube is going in the opposite direction"
00:12:54.680,00:13:00.240,"reducing the importance of subscribers means increasing the importance of sensationalism"
00:13:00.240,00:13:02.400,"and click-baity thumbnails"
00:13:02.400,00:13:06.680,"and so a few weeks ago I was out at the creator summit in New York"
00:13:06.680,00:13:08.240,"and I met MrBeast."
00:13:08.240,00:13:13.200,"I showed him some of the footage from this video I was working on about the shade balls in LA Reservoir"
00:13:13.200,00:13:16.800,"and MrBeast took one look at it, and he said to me"
00:13:19.200,00:13:20.290,"that's a banger"
00:13:21.240,00:13:26.360,"which I think it's pretty funny but I think clearly he knew that this was going to be a video that would take off"
00:13:26.360,00:13:28.880,"and we talked about titles and thumbnails"
00:13:28.880,00:13:35.600,"you might have noticed that the thumbnail borrows a bit from say his work with cereal and Orbeez in backyards"
00:13:35.600,00:13:39.160,"and I told him that I was thinking about calling it something like,"
00:13:39.160,00:13:41.080,"Throwing Shade Balls"
00:13:41.800,00:13:43.560,"and he was like, ""No""."
00:13:44.160,00:13:48.960,"He suggested, why are there 96 million black balls on this lake"
00:13:49.600,00:13:54.360,"Now I changed it to reservoir because I mean let's be real that's what it is"
00:13:54.360,00:13:58.320,"but it just goes to show how important the title and thumbnail are"
00:13:58.320,00:14:05.120,"what I learned talking to MrBeast was that going viral you can boil down to two metrics:"
00:14:05.120,00:14:08.360,"you need to do two things with your video in order for it to go viral"
00:14:08.360,00:14:11.720,"and I mean tens of millions of views as his channel shows"
00:14:11.720,00:14:15.360,"Okay the first thing, maybe not surprising, is watch time."
00:14:15.360,00:14:19.880,"so when people click on your video they actually have to watch a significant portion of it"
00:14:19.880,00:14:22.360,"It's useful if that's sort of seven or eight minutes"
00:14:22.360,00:14:26.080,"now that is the actual time that they watch, so you need a longer video than that,"
00:14:26.080,00:14:31.040,"say 15 minutes, if you want the average watch time to be around that 7 or 8 minute mark"
00:14:31.040,00:14:35.760,"Now for me, watch time is not that exciting of a metric to know that I have to hit"
00:14:35.760,00:14:39.800,"because I know that most people already watch most of my videos"
00:14:39.800,00:14:42.480,"so for me the big insight came with number two"
00:14:42.480,00:14:46.560,"if you want a viral video you need to have a high click-through rate"
00:14:46.560,00:14:50.560,"so that is the total number of clicks on your titles and thumbnails"
00:14:50.560,00:14:54.960,"divided by the number of times that title and thumbnail have been shown"
00:14:54.960,00:14:56.360,"that is your click-through rate"
00:14:56.360,00:15:03.440,"and MrBeast showed me this graph showing that as you approach 10% 20% 30% click-through rate"
00:15:03.440,00:15:07.080,"then the number of views and the number of impressions that video will get"
00:15:07.080,00:15:09.960,"Just skyrockets. It jumps dramatically"
00:15:10.640,00:15:12.600,"now on the one hand that kind of makes sense"
00:15:12.600,00:15:16.600,"because you know people are clicking a video obviously you're going to get more views"
00:15:16.600,00:15:19.760,"but it is such a dramatic increase"
00:15:19.760,00:15:26.200,"that it really turns the site into a place where the title and thumbnail are everything"
00:15:26.200,00:15:30.520,"you can have a great video but unless you have a great hook to get people in"
00:15:30.520,00:15:31.800,"it's not going to go viral"
00:15:32.400,00:15:35.480,"and so it was amazing to hear all these different YouTubers"
00:15:35.480,00:15:37.720,"talk about how they optimized a thumbnail"
00:15:37.720,00:15:41.040,"many people told me that when they were working on a thumbnail for a new video"
00:15:41.040,00:15:46.880,"they would actually Photoshop it onto a screenshot of their current YouTube home screen"
00:15:46.880,00:15:50.440,"in various positions and just see how eye catching it was"
00:15:50.440,00:15:56.200,"they're really working hard to make these thumbnails as clickable as possible"
00:15:56.200,00:15:58.320,"it's like weaponizing the thumbnail"
00:15:58.320,00:16:04.040,"and that arms race is only set to increase with the introduction of real-time click-through rate"
00:16:04.040,00:16:06.440,"which is coming out in a month or two"
00:16:06.440,00:16:08.120,"so what you can bet will happen"
00:16:08.120,00:16:13.400,"is that creators will launch a video and then they'll be sitting there with all these different variants of thumbnails"
00:16:13.400,00:16:17.720,"and they'll be swapping them out and looking at what that does to click-through rate"
00:16:17.720,00:16:22.040,"and then going with the one that leads to the greatest click-through rate"
00:16:22.560,00:16:26.360,"and you can imagine, if you don't do this, you're gonna be left behind"
00:16:26.360,00:16:30.520,"because all the other creators are sitting there swapping their thumbnails"
00:16:30.520,00:16:34.080,"to get the highest engagement that they possibly can on their videos"
00:16:34.080,00:16:38.160,"and if you're not doing that, then your videos will end up getting buried"
00:16:38.960,00:16:43.440,"So, acknowledging that this is the reality of YouTube"
00:16:43.440,00:16:47.560,"I want to outline to you my plan for what I will do going forward"
00:16:47.560,00:16:50.960,"First and foremost, I want to keep making high-quality videos"
00:16:50.960,00:16:53.480,"because if I don't do that I'm not going to be happy"
00:16:53.480,00:16:55.720,"I won't be satisfied and neither will you"
00:16:55.720,00:17:01.000,"but second of all I'm gonna have to choose topics that are more clickable"
00:17:01.000,00:17:06.880,"because frankly if I'm going to work for days and weeks and months on a video"
00:17:06.880,00:17:12.240,"I would like that video to get say 10 million views instead of half a million"
00:17:12.240,00:17:16.600,"so a lot of that comes down to ""is this topic clickable"""
00:17:16.600,00:17:21.960,"and so or number three I'm gonna have to use some clickbaity titles and thumbnails"
00:17:21.960,00:17:24.560,"and I apologize for that"
00:17:24.560,00:17:27.360,"but it just seems like it's an existential threat"
00:17:27.360,00:17:30.520,"that if you don't do that your channel will not be around for very long"
00:17:30.520,00:17:33.320,"and you'll be on that sort of downward slide"
00:17:33.320,00:17:36.200,"I'd love to know what you think, If you think it's a good idea a bad idea"
00:17:36.200,00:17:38.400,"I'm totally open to hearing you out"
00:17:38.400,00:17:42.880,"CaseyNeistat talked about how he's got to trust his audience, you know to come back to him"
00:17:42.880,00:17:47.280,"the truth is, the audience only knows you're there if they see your titles and thumbnails"
00:17:47.280,00:17:50.720,"I went to buy something at B&amp;H a little while ago, and the guy was like"
00:17:50.720,00:17:55.320,"""oh hey I love your videos!"" and then he said, ""are you still making them?"""
00:17:55.320,00:17:58.560,"and I was like, ""yeah yeah I'm making them. How do you not know?"""
00:17:58.560,00:18:00.760,"and I also see comments on my videos where people are like,"
00:18:00.760,00:18:03.200,"""oh great here's a veritasium video see you again in six months"""
00:18:03.760,00:18:06.920,"but I'm like, ""no I'm making these every week, every other week,"
00:18:06.920,00:18:09.480,"like I'm making them you just got to know that they're here"
00:18:09.480,00:18:11.600,"but you can only know that they're there if they surface"
00:18:11.600,00:18:14.360,"to the tip of the tip of the tip of the tip of the iceberg"
00:18:14.360,00:18:17.360,"which now is a click-through rate game"
00:18:20.080,00:18:25.480,"On the one hand, you could be a little bit disappointed by the way the game is working right now"
00:18:25.480,00:18:29.200,"but on the other hand I challenge you to think of a better way"
00:18:29.200,00:18:36.240,"because they have this limited real estate in which to show people potential videos they might be interested in"
00:18:36.240,00:18:41.160,"and of course they want to put the videos there that people are most likely to click"
00:18:41.160,00:18:43.760,"and then most likely to watch once they've clicked it"
00:18:43.760,00:18:47.120,"and like part of me is like, yeah I guess that's kind of fair"
00:18:47.120,00:18:51.600,"would you make the argument that you should put some videos there that people are less likely to click?"
00:18:52.760,00:18:55.720,"No. I mean, that doesn't seem to make any sense."
00:18:57.600,00:19:02.920,"so I kind of feel like this is the inevitable, rational endpoint"
00:19:02.920,00:19:07.040,"for any algorithm that is trying to optimize what people are watching"
00:19:07.040,00:19:13.000,"we want to give you the things that you want to watch and you indicate your desire by clicking on them"
00:19:13.760,00:19:18.960,"but by doing that it also means that things that are just less catchy, less sensational"
00:19:19.880,00:19:23.480,"don't rise into this level here"
00:19:24.160,00:19:29.760,"and I wonder more broadly, how does that affect us?"
00:19:29.760,00:19:32.160,"How does that affect the YouTube platform?"
00:19:32.160,00:19:35.680,"if the YouTube platform becomes a real clickbait site"
00:19:36.560,00:19:38.040,"Who wants to go there?"
00:19:38.040,00:19:40.000,"What types of audience will come there?"
00:19:40.000,00:19:43.120,"Will there even be an audience for educational content?"
00:19:44.040,00:19:48.080,"I think it's all these decisions about the system and the algorithm that determine"
00:19:48.080,00:19:51.440,"what the actual media looks like"
00:19:51.440,00:19:53.440,"what content is created"
00:19:53.440,00:19:55.000,"what people come to the site"
00:19:55.000,00:19:56.960,"what audiences are served there"
00:19:56.960,00:20:00.080,"And I think this is a broader issue than just YouTube."
00:20:00.080,00:20:05.160,"I mean, everywhere now we can be served the things that we you really want."
00:20:05.880,00:20:07.440,"but what does that world look like?"
00:20:07.440,00:20:10.400,"I mean you might have thought it would be this utopia"
00:20:11.040,00:20:13.360,"but I would argue that it's not."
00:20:13.920,00:20:22.120,"because it silences all these voices that you would otherwise get you know in a more curated marketplace"
00:20:22.120,00:20:25.440,"if you're just going for the things that drive the clicks"
00:20:26.040,00:20:30.720,"That is a very skewed view on the world and I'm not sure it's for the best"
00:20:31.360,00:20:38.280,"But there is one way on YouTube at least to short-circuit this effect"
00:20:38.280,00:20:42.120,"and it is to ring that bell"
00:20:43.720,00:20:47.680,"and you're like, ""oh the whole point of this video is to get to this point and tell you to ring the bell!"""
00:20:47.680,00:20:53.520,"I mean, no, if you want to ring the bell, I encourage you to do that now"
00:20:53.520,00:20:58.520,"because I feel like I never encouraged people to subscribe or ring the bell on this channel"
00:20:58.520,00:21:03.880,"because it seems needy and I think you can do whatever you want, whenever you want it"
00:21:04.520,00:21:08.280,"but in this ecosystem where click-through rate is king,"
00:21:08.280,00:21:13.880,"where millions of black balls on a reservoir is the thing that is going to rise to the surface,"
00:21:13.880,00:21:19.880,"the only way to get around that is to have people who are notified every time I make something"
00:21:20.240,00:21:25.040,"so I want you to think about the videos that I've made you know in the past and so far this year"
00:21:25.040,00:21:28.360,"and think about do you want to know about every single one of those?"
00:21:28.920,00:21:31.720,"and if you do then I encourage you to click the bell"
00:21:31.720,00:21:38.840,"and the more people who do that, the less I will be driven to make clickbaity titles and thumbnails and videos"
00:21:38.840,00:21:40.880,"because I'll know that I can reach my audience"
00:21:40.880,00:21:45.680,"without having to appeal to, you know, the basest instincts of people"
00:21:46.560,00:21:51.240,"So, if you want to see more of what I'm doing, click to subscribe, ring the bell"
00:21:51.240,00:21:53.640,"and if you don't then please you know unsubscribe"
00:21:53.640,00:21:57.160,"because it's good to give YouTube as clear of signals as possible"
00:21:58.480,00:22:00.520,"but I think there is a bit of hope for the future"
00:22:00.520,00:22:04.720,"because what I've described is the way YouTube appears to be working right now"
00:22:04.720,00:22:09.120,"but I think that, well we know that the algorithm is always shifting"
00:22:09.120,00:22:13.280,"and what I've heard is that the direction YouTube wants to go"
00:22:13.280,00:22:19.120,"is optimizing for long term, satisfied, watch time"
00:22:19.120,00:22:20.680,"That's got three pieces."
00:22:20.680,00:22:23.640,"You have to look at, are people coming back time after time"
00:22:23.640,00:22:27.040,"If they watch someone's videos do they come back time after time for months"
00:22:27.040,00:22:28.550,"That would be one signal."
00:22:28.550,00:22:30.800,"Are they watching for a long period of time?"
00:22:30.800,00:22:32.640,"That's also a sign that people are enjoying it"
00:22:32.640,00:22:35.040,"And finally, there's the satisfied piece."
00:22:35.040,00:22:38.480,"Are people satisfied by the things that they've seen?"
00:22:38.480,00:22:40.720,"This is a new metric to add in"
00:22:40.720,00:22:44.040,"And how do you really gauge satisfaction?"
00:22:44.040,00:22:47.480,"Well, YouTube is experimenting with surveys."
00:22:48.400,00:22:50.960,"Surveys just like this one."
00:22:50.960,00:22:57.640,"and they will hopefully allow us to come to a different place"
00:22:57.640,00:23:00.720,"where the algorithm isn't just about click-through rate and watch time"
00:23:00.720,00:23:02.644,"but it's also about satisfaction."
00:23:02.644,00:23:04.742,"How much you're driven to come back"
00:23:04.742,00:23:06.960,"How much you really love the content."
00:23:06.960,00:23:09.480,"So my great hope is if we move in this direction"
00:23:09.480,00:23:14.080,"there may be a time in the future where click-through rate is no longer king"
00:23:14.080,00:23:16.560,"I'd love to know what you think so let me know down in the comments"
00:23:16.560,00:23:18.640,"and I'm gonna jump straight into end screen here"
00:23:18.640,00:23:24.200,"I'm going to post a few thumbnails for videos that are not particularly a click-baity"
00:23:24.200,00:23:27.280,"so feel free to click these. I mean you're gonna look at them and be like, ""I don't want to click that"""
00:23:27.280,00:23:28.680,"but that's exactly the point."
00:23:28.680,00:23:33.840,"these are apparently good videos that maybe just aren't as catchy in terms of titles and thumbnails"
00:23:33.840,00:23:35.640,"If you want to subscribe you can click up here"
00:23:36.680,00:23:42.000,"and thanks for listening to the rant that I've given many times to whoever will listen"
