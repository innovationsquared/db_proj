00:00:00.030,00:00:02.680,"I want to thank the sponsor of this episode, LastPass,"
00:00:02.680,00:00:05.320,"which remembers your passwords so you don't have to"
00:00:05.320,00:00:07.960,"More about them at the end of the show"
00:00:09.680,00:00:13.280,"What you are looking at is known as the Dzhanibekov effect"
00:00:13.280,00:00:14.920,"or the tennis racket theorem"
00:00:14.920,00:00:17.200,"or the intermediate axis theorem"
00:00:17.200,00:00:18.960,"but we'll get to that"
00:00:18.960,00:00:21.880,"Now you may have seen clips like this one before,"
00:00:21.880,00:00:27.760,"but in this video I will provide the best intuitive explanation of how this effect works"
00:00:27.760,00:00:29.800,"or, at least, that's my goal."
00:00:29.800,00:00:33.400,"Now it involves arguably the best mathematician alive,"
00:00:33.400,00:00:37.120,"Soviet era secrets, and the end of the world"
00:00:37.120,00:00:45.360,"So in 1985, cosmonaut Vladimir Dzhanibekov was tasked with saving the Soviet space station Salyut 7"
00:00:45.360,00:00:47.920,"which had completely shut down"
00:00:47.920,00:00:52.560,"The mission was so dramatic that the Russians made a movie out of it in 2017"
00:00:52.560,00:00:54.720,"and after rescuing the space station,"
00:00:54.720,00:01:00.640,"Dzhanibekov unpacked supplies sent up from Earth which were locked down with a wing-nut"
00:01:00.640,00:01:05.880,"and as the wing-nut spun off the bolt, he noticed something strange:"
00:01:05.880,00:01:09.720,"the wing-nut maintained its orientation for a short time,"
00:01:09.720,00:01:12.720,"and then it flipped, 180 degrees."
00:01:12.720,00:01:15.960,"And as he kept watching, it flipped back a few seconds later"
00:01:15.960,00:01:20.240,"and it continued flipping back and forth at regular intervals"
00:01:20.240,00:01:25.440,"this motion wasn't caused by forces or torques applied to the wing-nut: there were none."
00:01:25.440,00:01:27.440,"And yet it kept flipping"
00:01:27.440,00:01:30.760,"It was a strange and counterintuitive phenomenon"
00:01:30.760,00:01:35.000,"One that the Russians kept secret for 10 years"
00:01:35.000,00:01:39.240,"Why the secrecy? Well that is what we're gonna find out"
00:01:39.240,00:01:45.240,"6 years later in 1991 a paper was published in the Journal of Dynamics and Differential Equations"
00:01:45.240,00:01:47.400,"called, ""The Twisting Tennis Racket"""
00:01:47.400,00:01:52.760,"and although it was related, it of course makes no mention of the secret Dzhanibekov effect"
00:01:52.760,00:01:55.840,"the paper says if you hold a tennis racket facing you,"
00:01:55.840,00:01:58.320,"and then flip it in the air like this,"
00:01:58.320,00:02:00.760,"it not only rotates the way you intend it to,"
00:02:00.760,00:02:04.800,"it also makes a half turn around an axis that passes through its handle"
00:02:04.800,00:02:09.880,"so the side that was originally facing you will be facing away when you catch it"
00:02:09.880,00:02:12.720,"Now to understand this we need to go through some basics"
00:02:12.720,00:02:17.720,"Like there are three ways spent a tennis racket about its three principal axes"
00:02:17.720,00:02:22.200,"the first is about an axis that runs through the handle, like this"
00:02:22.200,00:02:27.560,"the second is the way we were spinning it before with an axis that runs parallel to the head of the racket"
00:02:27.560,00:02:32.640,"and the third is about an axis that runs perpendicular to the head of the racket"
00:02:33.360,00:02:36.800,"now it's easier to spin the racket around some of these axes than others"
00:02:36.800,00:02:41.680,"That is, you get more angular velocity for a given amount of torque"
00:02:41.680,00:02:45.200,"It's easiest to spend the racket around this first axis"
00:02:45.200,00:02:46.800,"it gets going really fast"
00:02:46.800,00:02:52.880,"and that is because the mass is distributed closer to this axis than to any of the others"
00:02:52.880,00:02:58.880,"we say its moment of inertia is the smallest when spinning in this orientation"
00:02:58.880,00:03:03.360,"spinning about the third axis has the greatest moment of inertia"
00:03:03.360,00:03:06.800,"and so the racket gets spinning pretty slowly"
00:03:06.800,00:03:12.200,"and that's because this mass is distributed as far from this axis as possible"
00:03:12.200,00:03:15.120,"so this is the maximum moment of inertia axis"
00:03:15.120,00:03:19.360,"Now what you'll notice with spins about these axes, is that they're stable"
00:03:19.360,00:03:23.560,"There's no rotation happening about any of the other axes"
00:03:23.560,00:03:26.560,"when you try to rotate around the first or third axes"
00:03:26.560,00:03:30.320,"But rotating about the second axis, the intermediate axis,"
00:03:30.320,00:03:34.200,"where the moment of inertia is in between the other two"
00:03:34.200,00:03:41.880,"Well that is where you get this half twist, and there's virtually nothing you can do to stop it"
00:03:42.480,00:03:44.320,"and it's not just tennis rackets of course"
00:03:44.320,00:03:46.760,"I've done this before with cell phones"
00:03:46.760,00:03:49.440,"and with a disc with a hole in it"
00:03:49.440,00:03:53.080,"I took this disc on an ice rink and in a zero g plane"
00:03:53.080,00:03:56.880,"I have been obsessed with the intermediate axis theorem"
00:03:56.880,00:04:00.120,"and what you need to make the intermediate access effect work"
00:04:00.120,00:04:05.560,"is an object that has three different moments of inertia about its three principal axes"
00:04:05.560,00:04:08.280,"and well that's not every object"
00:04:08.280,00:04:10.760,"this object, for example, a spinning ring"
00:04:10.760,00:04:12.840,"has only two different moments of inertia"
00:04:12.840,00:04:14.160,"For rotation like that,"
00:04:14.160,00:04:17.240,"and then rotations like this"
00:04:18.040,00:04:19.840,"spinning things is not a specialty"
00:04:20.560,00:04:22.120,"Wow, I feel like it should be--"
00:04:22.120,00:04:25.240,"rotations like that. That's the one I was looking for"
00:04:25.240,00:04:29.160,"Anything with spherical symmetry has only one moment of inertia,"
00:04:29.160,00:04:32.760,"so these objects will not demonstrate the tennis racket theorem"
00:04:32.760,00:04:36.400,"for that you need what's called an asymmetric top"
00:04:36.400,00:04:40.200,"something with three different moments of inertia in its three different principal axes"
00:04:41.600,00:04:43.400,"now the tennis racket paper claims,"
00:04:43.400,00:04:46.360,"the twisting phenomenon seems to be new"
00:04:46.360,00:04:49.840,"it is not mentioned in general texts on classical mechanics"
00:04:49.840,00:04:52.240,"amongst other sources that they've checked"
00:04:52.240,00:04:54.440,"but it is actually"
00:04:54.440,00:04:58.360,"It's even in the textbook they've cited -- Landau and Lifschitz"
00:04:58.360,00:05:01.240,"In fact, an understanding of the intermediate axis theorem"
00:05:01.240,00:05:04.320,"goes back at least another a hundred and fifty years"
00:05:04.320,00:05:10.400,"to a book called ""The New Theory of Rotating Bodies"" by Louis Poinsot"
00:05:10.400,00:05:13.400,"So this is old physics"
00:05:13.400,00:05:18.040,"but in space, the phenomenon looks like something new"
00:05:18.040,00:05:24.280,"in microgravity, the effects are just so much more striking than a half twist of a tennis racket"
00:05:24.280,00:05:26.560,"and it random intervals on social media,"
00:05:26.560,00:05:29.440,"these videos crop up to frenzied questions of,"
00:05:29.440,00:05:33.840,"""Is this real?"" and ""What's going on?"", ""How does this work?"""
00:05:34.480,00:05:38.200,"well a number of simulations and animations have been made"
00:05:38.200,00:05:41.960,"but if you really want to understand what's happening,"
00:05:41.960,00:05:44.080,"most people resort to the math."
00:05:44.080,00:05:46.080,"Including me in the past."
00:05:46.080,00:05:47.960,"well the mathematics is kind of complicated"
00:05:47.960,00:05:50.720,"and boy is there a lot of math"
00:05:51.280,00:05:55.560,"there's this story of a student who asked famous physicist Richard Feynman"
00:05:55.560,00:05:59.640,"if there was any intuitive way of understanding the intermediate axis theorem"
00:05:59.640,00:06:04.960,"and as the story goes he thought about it carefully and deeply for ten or fifteen seconds,"
00:06:04.960,00:06:06.640,"and then said.."
00:06:06.640,00:06:07.560,"""No."""
00:06:08.280,00:06:13.000,"Well the goal of this video is to prove Feynman wrong"
00:06:13.000,00:06:17.080,"To provide an intuitive explanation of the intermediate axis theorem"
00:06:17.080,00:06:19.400,"but the explanation is not mine"
00:06:19.400,00:06:23.160,"it actually comes from one of the greatest living mathematicians,"
00:06:23.160,00:06:24.200,"Terry Tao."
00:06:24.200,00:06:28.240,"He has won the Fields Medal amongst a host of other awards"
00:06:28.240,00:06:31.040,"and for this video I actually asked him for an interview"
00:06:31.040,00:06:35.320,"but he declined because he's busy solving centuries-old math problems"
00:06:35.320,00:06:36.720,"so, you know, fair enough."
00:06:36.720,00:06:42.440,"But that's okay, because we have the explanation he posted to Math Overflow in 2011"
00:06:42.440,00:06:44.520,"and it goes like this"
00:06:44.520,00:06:51.480,"Imagine we have a thin rigid massless disc centered in our coordinate system."
00:06:51.480,00:06:56.480,"Now add some heavy point masses to opposite edges of the disks on the x-axis"
00:06:56.480,00:06:58.200,"Even though they're point masses,"
00:06:58.200,00:07:02.600,"I'll put some large cubes around them to remind us of their significant mass"
00:07:02.600,00:07:07.560,"Then, add some light point masses on opposite edges of the disc on the y-axis"
00:07:07.560,00:07:12.840,"now this disc has three different moments of inertia about its three principal axes"
00:07:12.840,00:07:16.200,"Rotating around the x-axis has the smallest moment of inertia,"
00:07:16.200,00:07:18.360,"since only the light masses are moving"
00:07:18.360,00:07:21.480,"Rotating about the z axis has the greatest moment of inertia,"
00:07:21.480,00:07:23.560,"since all four masses are going around"
00:07:23.560,00:07:28.080,"and rotating about the y axis has the intermediate moment of inertia"
00:07:28.080,00:07:32.400,"rotating like this, the only forces in the disc are centripetal forces"
00:07:32.400,00:07:35.520,"which accelerate the big masses towards the center"
00:07:35.520,00:07:39.240,"this keeps them turning in uniform circular motion"
00:07:39.240,00:07:41.340,"now what if we change reference frames"
00:07:41.340,00:07:43.400,"so now we're rotating with the disc?"
00:07:43.400,00:07:46.400,"well then we see centrifugal forces appear."
00:07:46.400,00:07:49.080,"Normally I don't like talking about centrifugal forces,"
00:07:49.080,00:07:53.640,"because well if you analyze things in inertial frames of reference, you never have to deal with them"
00:07:53.640,00:07:56.240,"But, if you're in a rotating frame of reference,"
00:07:56.240,00:08:03.480,"then centrifugal forces do appear in the analysis pushing any masses away from the rotation axis"
00:08:03.480,00:08:07.120,"and those forces are proportional to their distance from the axis"
00:08:07.120,00:08:09.240,"In this case, the y axis"
00:08:09.240,00:08:14.920,"So here there is no centrifugal force on the small masses because they're located right on the y axis"
00:08:14.920,00:08:18.960,"so the only centrifugal force acts on the big masses outwards"
00:08:18.960,00:08:22.520,"and that's balanced by the centripetal forces pushing inwards"
00:08:23.040,00:08:26.000,"now this is all fine and good, but what if the disc is bumped"
00:08:26.000,00:08:29.800,"so that it's no longer rotating perfectly about the y axis?"
00:08:29.800,00:08:33.240,"well now the small masses will experience some centrifugal force"
00:08:33.240,00:08:35.800,"proportional to their distance from the y axis"
00:08:36.240,00:08:41.400,"tension forces within the disc ensure that these small masses remain orthogonal to the big masses"
00:08:41.400,00:08:45.880,"and since the big masses are still spinning in roughly the same positions as they were before,"
00:08:45.880,00:08:47.520,"with lots of inertia"
00:08:47.520,00:08:51.680,"they constrain the small masses to lie more or less in the y-z plane"
00:08:52.600,00:08:57.240,"the little centrifugal forces on these small masses start accelerating them"
00:08:57.240,00:09:03.200,"and those forces get bigger as the masses move further and further from the y axis"
00:09:03.200,00:09:07.920,"and they keep accelerating until they flip onto opposite sides"
00:09:07.920,00:09:13.320,"now for the first half of this flip the centrifugal forces are accelerating the small masses,"
00:09:13.320,00:09:17.760,"but in the second half the centrifugal forces slow the masses down,"
00:09:17.760,00:09:20.640,"Reversing all the previous acceleration"
00:09:20.640,00:09:24.800,"so that they basically come to rest when they reach the opposite side"
00:09:25.400,00:09:27.680,"the pattern then repeats indefinitely"
00:09:27.680,00:09:31.640,"with the disc flipping back and forth at regular intervals"
00:09:31.640,00:09:36.560,"and there you have it-- an intuitive explanation for the intermediate axis theorem"
00:09:36.560,00:09:41.160,"or tennis racket theorem, or Dzhanibekov effect, or whatever you want to call it"
00:09:43.360,00:09:46.080,"so if this is well established classical physics"
00:09:46.080,00:09:49.400,"why did the Soviets make it classified for ten years?"
00:09:49.400,00:09:55.080,"well possibly because of what Dzhanibekov did after observing the strange behavior of the wing-nut"
00:09:55.080,00:09:58.600,"he attached a ball of modeling clay or plasticine to it"
00:09:58.600,00:10:00.120,"and tried spinning that"
00:10:00.120,00:10:05.080,"And sure enough, he found that just like the wing-nut, this ball flipped over periodically"
00:10:05.080,00:10:10.720,"and the implication was that maybe since the Earth is a spinning ball in space,"
00:10:10.720,00:10:13.560,"it too could flip over"
00:10:13.560,00:10:17.880,"I mean we know the Earth's magnetic poles have reversed in the past so could this be related?"
00:10:18.600,00:10:22.440,"In 2012 with the Mayan prophecies of the end of the world,"
00:10:22.440,00:10:24.480,"speculation about the Dzhanibekov effect"
00:10:24.480,00:10:29.080,"proved irresistible for some conspiracy theorists and people in the media"
00:10:29.080,00:10:35.360,"Plus on May 13th 2012, the official site of the Russian federal space agency, RusCosmos,"
00:10:35.360,00:10:39.280,"posted an article in honor of Dzhanibekov's 70th birthday"
00:10:39.280,00:10:40.840,"and in it they said,"
00:10:40.840,00:10:45.400,"the spinning nut of Dzhanibekov caused astonishment and simultaneous danger"
00:10:45.400,00:10:48.040,"to a certain part of the scientific world"
00:10:48.040,00:10:50.040,"a hypothesis was proposed"
00:10:50.040,00:10:55.440,"that our planet, in the course of its orbital motion, can execute the same overturn"
00:10:56.600,00:11:00.280,"So, how do we assess the validity of this hypothesis?"
00:11:00.280,00:11:03.960,"I mean, is the earth actually going to flip over?"
00:11:04.640,00:11:07.520,"well we can get some clues from simple experiments"
00:11:07.520,00:11:11.200,"performed by astronaut Don Pettit aboard the space station"
00:11:11.200,00:11:18.040,"he shows that a book will spin stably about its first or third axis just as we'd expect"
00:11:18.040,00:11:23.960,"and a solid cylinder will also spin stably around its first or third axis"
00:11:23.960,00:11:29.640,"but a liquid filled cylinder spinning about the first axis-- that's the one with the smallest moment of inertia,"
00:11:29.640,00:11:31.040,"it's unstable"
00:11:31.040,00:11:35.760,"and it'll end up rotating about its axis with the largest moment of inertia"
00:11:36.360,00:11:37.920,"Why is this?"
00:11:38.440,00:11:40.680,"For an isolated object spinning in space,"
00:11:40.680,00:11:45.880,"you'd probably think both its angular momentum and its kinetic energy would be constant"
00:11:45.880,00:11:48.080,"but, that's only half true."
00:11:48.080,00:11:50.000,"angular momentum stays constant,"
00:11:50.000,00:11:54.520,"but kinetic energy can be converted into other forms of energy, like heat"
00:11:54.520,00:11:59.920,"So, in this case, as the liquid's sloshing around inside, the energy can be dissipated"
00:11:59.920,00:12:03.320,"and spinning about the axis with the smallest moment of inertia"
00:12:03.320,00:12:06.640,"also means spinning with the greatest kinetic energy"
00:12:06.640,00:12:08.520,"and as this kinetic energy is dissipated,"
00:12:08.520,00:12:14.040,"the cylinder has no other option but to spin about the axis that achieves the minimum kinetic energy"
00:12:14.040,00:12:17.400,"and that is the one with the largest moment of inertia,"
00:12:17.400,00:12:19.800,"so when it's rotating end-over-end"
00:12:19.800,00:12:24.560,"for a given amount of angular momentum then, rotating with the maximum moment of inertia"
00:12:24.560,00:12:26.840,"is the lowest energy state"
00:12:26.840,00:12:29.760,"so that is the state that all bodies will tend towards"
00:12:29.760,00:12:32.440,"if they have any way of dissipating their energy"
00:12:32.440,00:12:37.600,"the u.s. learned this the hard way with their first satellite-- the Explorer one"
00:12:37.600,00:12:42.800,"it was designed to spin about its long axis and be spin stabilized"
00:12:42.800,00:12:47.120,"but within hours of achieving orbit it was rotating end over end"
00:12:47.800,00:12:51.400,"But, what happened? I mean it seems like a rigid cylinder"
00:12:51.400,00:12:54.600,"Well the problem was these flexible antennas"
00:12:54.600,00:12:58.760,"they allowed the satellite to dissipate energy as they swung back and forth"
00:12:58.760,00:13:01.520,"gradually reducing the kinetic energy of the satellite"
00:13:01.520,00:13:06.000,"until it had to rotate by the axis that maximized its moment of inertia"
00:13:06.600,00:13:08.760,"Now the earth is just like this."
00:13:08.760,00:13:11.560,"It has ways of dissipating energy internally,"
00:13:11.560,00:13:17.160,"So over time it has come to spin about the axis with maximum moment of inertia"
00:13:17.160,00:13:20.200,"and most astronomical objects do the same."
00:13:20.200,00:13:27.840,"Mars for example has a mass concentration or major positive gravity anomaly called the Tharsis Rise"
00:13:27.840,00:13:31.600,"and it is located, not coincidentally, at the equator"
00:13:31.600,00:13:34.880,"because that puts it as far as possible from the axis of rotation"
00:13:34.880,00:13:38.960,"and ensures that Mars is rotating with the maximum moment of inertia"
00:13:38.960,00:13:42.440,"Most asteroids, far from rotating about random axes,"
00:13:42.440,00:13:46.920,"They spin, almost all of them around the axis with the maximum moment of inertia"
00:13:46.920,00:13:48.920,"So the Earth won't flip."
00:13:48.920,00:13:52.120,"It's spinning about the axis with the maximum moment of inertia"
00:13:52.120,00:13:54.280,"And that is stable."
