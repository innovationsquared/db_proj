00:00:00.136,00:00:03.891,"- Take the number 5 and square it, you get 25."
00:00:03.891,00:00:07.642,"Now take 25 and square it, you get 625."
00:00:07.642,00:00:08.475,"Square 625, and you get 390,625."
00:00:12.930,00:00:14.790,"Do you see the pattern?"
00:00:14.790,00:00:16.860,"5 squared ends in a 5,"
00:00:16.860,00:00:21.727,"25 squared ends in 25, and 625 squared ends in 625."
00:00:23.010,00:00:25.020,"So does this pattern continue?"
00:00:25.020,00:00:29.310,"Well, let's try squaring 390,625."
00:00:29.310,00:00:31.470,"It doesn't quite end in itself,"
00:00:31.470,00:00:33.270,"but the last 5 digits match,"
00:00:33.270,00:00:36.120,"so it extends the pattern by a few places."
00:00:36.120,00:00:40.530,"So let's try squaring just that part, 90,625."
00:00:40.530,00:00:42.420,"Well, that does end in itself,"
00:00:42.420,00:00:45.060,"and if we squared that whole number,"
00:00:45.060,00:00:46.860,"it also ends in itself,"
00:00:46.860,00:00:49.560,"and now we're up to 10 digits,"
00:00:49.560,00:00:51.180,"and you can keep doing this."
00:00:51.180,00:00:52.530,"Squaring the part of the answer"
00:00:52.530,00:00:54.480,"that matches the previous number"
00:00:54.480,00:00:57.630,"and increasing the number of digits they share in common,"
00:00:57.630,00:01:00.630,"it's as though we are converging on a number,"
00:01:00.630,00:01:03.540,"but not in the usual sense of convergence."
00:01:03.540,00:01:07.920,"This number will have infinite digits, and if you square it,"
00:01:07.920,00:01:10.560,"you'll get back that same number."
00:01:10.560,00:01:13.800,"The number is its own square."
00:01:13.800,00:01:15.247,"Now, I bet you're thinking,"
00:01:15.247,00:01:17.430,"""Does it even make sense to talk about numbers"
00:01:17.430,00:01:18.960,"that have infinite digits going off"
00:01:18.960,00:01:20.610,"to the left of the decimal point?"
00:01:20.610,00:01:23.370,"I mean, isn't that just infinity?"""
00:01:23.370,00:01:25.620,"In this video, my goal is to convince you"
00:01:25.620,00:01:27.870,"that such numbers do make sense."
00:01:27.870,00:01:29.280,"They just belong to a number system"
00:01:29.280,00:01:30.450,"that works very differently"
00:01:30.450,00:01:32.190,"from the one we're used to,"
00:01:32.190,00:01:34.380,"and that allows these numbers"
00:01:34.380,00:01:36.480,"to solve problems that are impenetrable"
00:01:36.480,00:01:38.100,"using ordinary numbers,"
00:01:38.100,00:01:39.990,"which is why they are a fundamental tool"
00:01:39.990,00:01:42.840,"in cutting edge research today in number theory,"
00:01:42.840,00:01:45.240,"algebraic geometry, and beyond."
00:01:45.240,00:01:47.160,"So let's start by looking at the properties"
00:01:47.160,00:01:47.993,"of the number system"
00:01:47.993,00:01:50.133,"that includes the number we just found."
00:01:51.570,00:01:54.180,"We'll call these 10-adic numbers"
00:01:54.180,00:01:56.700,"because they're written in base 10."
00:01:56.700,00:01:58.860,"If you have two 10-adic numbers,"
00:01:58.860,00:02:00.660,"can you add them together?"
00:02:00.660,00:02:04.290,"Sure, you just go digit by digit from the right to the left,"
00:02:04.290,00:02:08.580,"adding them up as usual, addition is not a problem."
00:02:08.580,00:02:10.140,"What about multiplication?"
00:02:10.140,00:02:12.840,"Well, again, you can take any two 10-adic numbers"
00:02:12.840,00:02:14.550,"and multiply them out."
00:02:14.550,00:02:16.800,"This works because the last digit of the answer"
00:02:16.800,00:02:20.370,"depends only on the last digits of the 10-adic numbers,"
00:02:20.370,00:02:22.440,"and subsequent digits depend only"
00:02:22.440,00:02:24.420,"on the numbers to their right."
00:02:24.420,00:02:26.040,"So it might take a lot of work,"
00:02:26.040,00:02:29.553,"but you can keep going for as many digits as you like."
00:02:30.930,00:02:33.300,"Let's take one 10-adic number ending"
00:02:33.300,00:02:36.610,"in 857142857143, and multiply it by 7."
00:02:41.280,00:02:44.670,"So 7 times 3 is 21, carry the 2,"
00:02:44.670,00:02:48.330,"7 times 4 is 28 plus 2 makes 30, carry the 3,"
00:02:48.330,00:02:52.080,"7 times 1 is 7 plus 3 makes 10, carry the 1,"
00:02:52.080,00:02:55.920,"7 times 7 is 49 plus 1 is 50, carry the 5,"
00:02:55.920,00:03:00.180,"7 times 5 is 35 plus 5 is 40, carry the 4,"
00:03:00.180,00:03:01.913,"and you can keep going forever"
00:03:01.913,00:03:05.362,"and you'll find all the other digits are 0."
00:03:05.362,00:03:10.110,"So this number times 7 equals 1,"
00:03:10.110,00:03:12.690,"which means this 10-adic number"
00:03:12.690,00:03:15.273,"must be equal to 1/7th."
00:03:16.890,00:03:18.030,"What we have just found"
00:03:18.030,00:03:20.790,"is that there are rational numbers, fractions,"
00:03:20.790,00:03:22.230,"in the 10-adic numbers"
00:03:22.230,00:03:24.693,"without having to use the divided by symbol."
00:03:26.520,00:03:29.880,"Say you wanna find the 10-adic number that equals 1/3."
00:03:29.880,00:03:31.530,"How would you do it?"
00:03:31.530,00:03:34.410,"Well, let's imagine we have an infinite string of digits,"
00:03:34.410,00:03:37.770,"and when we multiply them by 3, we get 1."
00:03:37.770,00:03:39.630,"This implies that all the digits"
00:03:39.630,00:03:42.360,"to the left of the 1 must be 0."
00:03:42.360,00:03:44.490,"So what do we multiply 3 by to get a 1"
00:03:44.490,00:03:46.080,"in the unit's place?"
00:03:46.080,00:03:48.600,"Well, 3 times 7 is 21,"
00:03:48.600,00:03:52.170,"so that gives us the 1, and then we carry the 2."
00:03:52.170,00:03:57.170,"Now what times 3 plus 2 gives us a 0? 6."
00:03:57.180,00:04:00.810,"3 x 6 = 18 + 2 = 20."
00:04:00.810,00:04:03.720,"So we have a 0 and we carry the 2."
00:04:03.720,00:04:06.270,"Put another 6 there and we get another 20 again."
00:04:06.270,00:04:09.480,"So if we put a string of 6s all the way to the left,"
00:04:09.480,00:04:11.820,"they will all multiply to make a 0."
00:04:11.820,00:04:16.820,"So an infinite string of 6s and one 7 is equal to 1/3."
00:04:17.822,00:04:21.390,"This looks similar to the infinite digits we're used to"
00:04:21.390,00:04:23.580,"going off to the right of the decimal point,"
00:04:23.580,00:04:26.790,"like 0.9999999 repeating."
00:04:26.790,00:04:28.650,"What does this equal?"
00:04:28.650,00:04:32.250,"Well, I'll claim that it's exactly equal to 1,"
00:04:32.250,00:04:34.440,"but how do we prove it?"
00:04:34.440,00:04:36.060,"Let's call this number k,"
00:04:36.060,00:04:38.450,"and then multiply both sides by 10."
00:04:38.450,00:04:42.785,"So now we've got 9.999 repeating equals 10k."
00:04:42.785,00:04:45.600,"Now, subtract the top equation from the bottom one"
00:04:45.600,00:04:50.600,"to get 9 = 9k, so k = 1."
00:04:50.910,00:04:52.680,"This is a fairly standard argument"
00:04:52.680,00:04:57.680,"for why 0.999 repeating must be exactly equal to 1."
00:04:57.990,00:04:59.460,"But what if instead of going"
00:04:59.460,00:05:00.960,"to the right of the decimal place,"
00:05:00.960,00:05:04.440,"the 9s went to the left of the decimal place,"
00:05:04.440,00:05:07.560,"that is a 10-adic number of all 9s."
00:05:07.560,00:05:09.840,"What does this number equal?"
00:05:09.840,00:05:11.610,"Well, we can do the same thing,"
00:05:11.610,00:05:13.560,"set it equal to say m,"
00:05:13.560,00:05:15.810,"and then multiply both sides by 10."
00:05:15.810,00:05:20.810,"So we have 999999990 equals 10m."
00:05:21.060,00:05:23.670,"Now, subtract this equation from the first one,"
00:05:23.670,00:05:28.670,"and we get 9 = -9m, meaning m = -1."
00:05:31.410,00:05:36.410,"So this 10-adic string of all 9s is actually -1."
00:05:37.080,00:05:40.980,"Now, I know that seems weird, so let's try adding 1 to it."
00:05:40.980,00:05:43.710,"Well, 9 + 1 is 10, carry the 1,"
00:05:43.710,00:05:45.540,"9 + 1 is 10, carry the 1,"
00:05:45.540,00:05:48.420,"and you just keep doing this all the way down the line"
00:05:48.420,00:05:50.970,"and every digit becomes 0."
00:05:50.970,00:05:52.860,"I know it seems like at some point,"
00:05:52.860,00:05:55.680,"you're gonna end up with a 1 all the way down on the left,"
00:05:55.680,00:05:59.610,"but this never happens because the 9s go on forever."
00:05:59.610,00:06:01.980,"All 9s + 1 = 0,"
00:06:01.980,00:06:05.610,"therefore all 9s must be equal to -1."
00:06:05.610,00:06:07.350,"This also means that all 9s"
00:06:07.350,00:06:10.860,"and then say a 3 equals -7."
00:06:10.860,00:06:13.050,"What we have just discovered is that the 10-adics"
00:06:13.050,00:06:15.630,"contain negative numbers as well."
00:06:15.630,00:06:17.550,"You don't need a negative sign"
00:06:17.550,00:06:19.860,"by the structure of these numbers alone,"
00:06:19.860,00:06:21.990,"negatives are included."
00:06:21.990,00:06:23.100,"To do subtraction,"
00:06:23.100,00:06:26.160,"you just add the negative of that number."
00:06:26.160,00:06:28.110,"To find the negative of any 10-adic number,"
00:06:28.110,00:06:30.300,"you could multiply by all 9s"
00:06:30.300,00:06:33.060,"or just perform these 2 steps."
00:06:33.060,00:06:34.830,"First, take the 9s complement,"
00:06:34.830,00:06:35.663,"that is the difference"
00:06:35.663,00:06:39.450,"between each digit and 9, and then add 1."
00:06:39.450,00:06:43.410,"So if this number is 1/7, then -1/7"
00:06:43.410,00:06:46.083,"is 142857142856 + 1,"
00:06:51.266,00:06:55.080,"and we can verify that this is indeed -1/7"
00:06:55.080,00:06:57.180,"by adding it to positive 1/7,"
00:06:57.180,00:07:00.933,"and finding that these numbers annihilate each other to 0."
00:07:02.055,00:07:05.880,"So to sum up, 10-adic numbers can be added, subtracted,"
00:07:05.880,00:07:09.150,"multiplied, and they work exactly as you'd expect."
00:07:09.150,00:07:11.760,"Plus they contain fractions and negative numbers"
00:07:11.760,00:07:14.250,"without having to use additional symbols."
00:07:14.250,00:07:16.650,"There is just one big problem,"
00:07:16.650,00:07:19.710,"and you can see it with the first 10-adic number we found."
00:07:19.710,00:07:22.350,"Remember, if you multiply this number by itself,"
00:07:22.350,00:07:24.870,"you get back that same number."
00:07:24.870,00:07:27.960,"This number is its own square,"
00:07:27.960,00:07:30.330,"and that's a problem which you can see"
00:07:30.330,00:07:33.240,"if we move the end to the left-hand side and factor it."
00:07:33.240,00:07:37.170,"Well, then we have n times n minus 1 equals 0."
00:07:37.170,00:07:40.500,"The numbers 0 or 1 would satisfy this equation,"
00:07:40.500,00:07:44.100,"but our 10-adic number is not 0 or 1."
00:07:44.100,00:07:46.380,"You can even verify by multiplying it out."
00:07:46.380,00:07:51.380,"This number n times n minus 1 really does work out to 0."
00:07:52.080,00:07:55.050,"This breaks 1 of the tools mathematicians rely on"
00:07:55.050,00:07:56.430,"to solve equations."
00:07:56.430,00:07:57.510,"I mean, have you ever thought"
00:07:57.510,00:08:00.030,"about why when faced with some complicated equation,"
00:08:00.030,00:08:01.770,"we move all the terms to one side,"
00:08:01.770,00:08:04.290,"set them equal to 0, and then factor them?"
00:08:04.290,00:08:07.350,"Well, I certainly haven't before making this video,"
00:08:07.350,00:08:09.120,"but there is a good reason,"
00:08:09.120,00:08:12.630,"and it comes down to the special property of 0."
00:08:12.630,00:08:15.900,"If several terms multiplied together equal 0,"
00:08:15.900,00:08:19.740,"then you know at least one of those terms must be 0,"
00:08:19.740,00:08:20.850,"and this allows us"
00:08:20.850,00:08:23.550,"to break down complicated higher order equations"
00:08:23.550,00:08:27.093,"into a set of smaller, simpler equations, and solve."
00:08:29.070,00:08:31.440,"But this won't work with the 10-adics,"
00:08:31.440,00:08:34.020,"and fundamentally, the reason is because we're working"
00:08:34.020,00:08:37.770,"in base 10, and 10 is a composite number,"
00:08:37.770,00:08:41.310,"it's not a prime, it's 5 x 2."
00:08:41.310,00:08:43.260,"Say you wanna find two 10-adic numbers"
00:08:43.260,00:08:44.970,"that multiply to 0,"
00:08:44.970,00:08:48.810,"then to start off, you know that the last digit must be 0."
00:08:48.810,00:08:51.600,"So which two numbers could you multiply to get a 0"
00:08:51.600,00:08:53.220,"in the unit's place?"
00:08:53.220,00:08:55.770,"Well, you could multiply a 0 times any number,"
00:08:55.770,00:08:57.270,"that's no problem,"
00:08:57.270,00:09:01.290,"but you could also multiply say 5 x 4 and get 20,"
00:09:01.290,00:09:03.720,"which gives you a 0 in the unit's place."
00:09:03.720,00:09:06.300,"Then you can carry the 2 and find another two numbers"
00:09:06.300,00:09:08.760,"that will give you a 0 in the ten's place,"
00:09:08.760,00:09:11.040,"and you can keep building the numbers from there,"
00:09:11.040,00:09:13.980,"so that all the digits work out to 0."
00:09:13.980,00:09:15.450,"There is a way to avoid this,"
00:09:15.450,00:09:18.960,"and that is to use a prime number base instead of base 10."
00:09:18.960,00:09:22.950,"It could be any prime like 2, 3, 5, 7, et cetera."
00:09:22.950,00:09:25.590,"As an example, let's create a 3-adic number."
00:09:25.590,00:09:28.320,"So this is a base 3 number with infinite digits"
00:09:28.320,00:09:30.360,"to the left of the decimal point."
00:09:30.360,00:09:31.500,"In the 3-adics,"
00:09:31.500,00:09:34.860,"the only digits we can use are 0, 1, and 2"
00:09:34.860,00:09:38.100,"because 3 is the same thing as 10."
00:09:38.100,00:09:42.300,"Now, how could you multiply 2, 3-adic numbers to get 0?"
00:09:42.300,00:09:43.950,"Well, again, we can start by just looking"
00:09:43.950,00:09:48.550,"at the last digit, 1 x 1 is 1, 2 x 1 is 2,"
00:09:48.550,00:09:53.550,"and 2 x 2 is 4, which, in base 3, is 11."
00:09:54.510,00:09:56.880,"So the only way to get a 0 is"
00:09:56.880,00:10:00.870,"if 1 of those 3-adic digits itself is 0,"
00:10:00.870,00:10:03.930,"and it's the same for all the digits going to the left."
00:10:03.930,00:10:06.210,"The only way they multiply the 0 is"
00:10:06.210,00:10:10.452,"if one of the 3-adic numbers is itself entirely 0."
00:10:10.452,00:10:12.870,"And this works for any prime base"
00:10:12.870,00:10:14.790,"and restores the useful property"
00:10:14.790,00:10:17.910,"that the product of several numbers will only be 0"
00:10:17.910,00:10:21.123,"if one of those numbers is itself 0."
00:10:22.140,00:10:25.740,"Here is a random 3-adic number, this number"
00:10:25.740,00:10:30.740,"means 1 x 3 to the 0 + 2 x 3 + 1 x 3 squared + 1 x 3 cubed,"
00:10:33.870,00:10:35.100,"and so on."
00:10:35.100,00:10:36.750,"So you can think of a 3-adic number"
00:10:36.750,00:10:40.290,"as an infinite expansion in powers of 3."
00:10:40.290,00:10:42.720,"The 3-adic integer that equals -1"
00:10:42.720,00:10:45.240,"would be an infinite string of 2s."
00:10:45.240,00:10:50.190,"If you add 1, then 2 + 1 is 3, which in base 3 is 10."
00:10:50.190,00:10:52.080,"So you leave the 0, carry the 1,"
00:10:52.080,00:10:54.300,"and 2 + 1 is again 10."
00:10:54.300,00:10:55.170,"So you carry the 1,"
00:10:55.170,00:10:57.603,"and you keep going on like that forever."
00:10:58.530,00:11:01.560,"P-adics have all the same properties as the 10-adics,"
00:11:01.560,00:11:03.630,"but in addition, you will never find a number"
00:11:03.630,00:11:06.750,"that is its own square besides 0 and 1"
00:11:06.750,00:11:08.640,"nor will you find one non-0 number"
00:11:08.640,00:11:11.580,"times another non-0 number being equal to 0."
00:11:11.580,00:11:13.470,"And this is why professional mathematicians"
00:11:13.470,00:11:16.590,"work with p-adics where the p stands for prime"
00:11:16.590,00:11:18.660,"rather than say the 10-adics."
00:11:18.660,00:11:20.670,"P-adics are the real tool."
00:11:20.670,00:11:21.900,"They have been used in the work"
00:11:21.900,00:11:24.510,"of over a dozen recent Fields Medalists."
00:11:24.510,00:11:26.220,"They were even involved in cracking one"
00:11:26.220,00:11:28.983,"of the most legendary math problems of all time."
00:11:30.179,00:11:32.670,"In 1637, Pierre de Fermat"
00:11:32.670,00:11:34.260,"was reading the book ""Arithmetica"""
00:11:34.260,00:11:37.260,"by the ancient Greek mathematician Diophantus."
00:11:37.260,00:11:39.420,"Diophantus was interested in the solutions"
00:11:39.420,00:11:42.750,"to polynomial equations phrased in geometric terms"
00:11:42.750,00:11:44.730,"like the Pythagorean theorem."
00:11:44.730,00:11:49.730,"For a right triangle, x squared + y squared = z squared."
00:11:49.800,00:11:51.570,"The set of solutions to this equation"
00:11:51.570,00:11:53.820,"in the real numbers is pretty easy to find."
00:11:53.820,00:11:56.520,"It's just an infinite cone."
00:11:56.520,00:11:58.710,"But Diophantus wanted to find solutions"
00:11:58.710,00:12:01.080,"that were whole numbers or fractions"
00:12:01.080,00:12:06.080,"like 3, 4, 5 and 5, 12, 13, and he wasn't the first."
00:12:07.230,00:12:09.780,"Here is an ancient Babylonian clay tablet"
00:12:09.780,00:12:13.290,"from about 2000 BC with a huge list"
00:12:13.290,00:12:15.210,"of these Pythagorean triples."
00:12:15.210,00:12:17.340,"By the way, this list predates Pythagoras"
00:12:17.340,00:12:19.590,"by more than a millennium."
00:12:19.590,00:12:21.690,"Right next to Diophantus' discussion"
00:12:21.690,00:12:23.220,"of the Pythagorean theorem,"
00:12:23.220,00:12:25.620,"Fermat writes a statement that will go down in history"
00:12:25.620,00:12:28.470,"as one of the most infamous of all time."
00:12:28.470,00:12:32.790,"The equation x to the n + y to the n = z to the n"
00:12:32.790,00:12:37.230,"has no solutions in integer for any n greater than 2."
00:12:37.230,00:12:39.930,"I have a truly marvelous proof of this fact,"
00:12:39.930,00:12:42.333,"but it's too long to be contained in the margin."
00:12:43.230,00:12:45.600,"Fermat's last theorem, as this became known,"
00:12:45.600,00:12:48.990,"would go unproven for 358 years."
00:12:48.990,00:12:50.430,"In fact, to solve it,"
00:12:50.430,00:12:53.490,"new numbers had to be invented, the p-adics,"
00:12:53.490,00:12:55.500,"and these provide a systematic method"
00:12:55.500,00:12:56.760,"for solving other problems"
00:12:56.760,00:12:58.767,"in Diophantus' ""Arithmetica."""
00:13:00.420,00:13:03.210,"For example, find three squares"
00:13:03.210,00:13:06.150,"whose areas add to create a bigger square"
00:13:06.150,00:13:08.790,"and the area of the first square is the side length"
00:13:08.790,00:13:09.870,"of the second square,"
00:13:09.870,00:13:12.510,"and the area of the second square is the side length"
00:13:12.510,00:13:13.713,"of the third square."
00:13:14.580,00:13:16.680,"- He's really giving the the first instance"
00:13:16.680,00:13:21.060,"of algebra many, many centuries before, al-jabr."
00:13:21.060,00:13:22.200,"- [Derek] So if we set the side"
00:13:22.200,00:13:26.100,"of the first square to be x, then its area is x squared."
00:13:26.100,00:13:28.200,"This is the side length of the second square"
00:13:28.200,00:13:31.170,"which therefore has an area of x to the 4."
00:13:31.170,00:13:33.060,"This is then the side length of the third square"
00:13:33.060,00:13:35.460,"which has an area of x to the 8."
00:13:35.460,00:13:37.440,"And we want these three areas,"
00:13:37.440,00:13:39.960,"x squared + x to the 4 + x to the 8"
00:13:39.960,00:13:42.300,"to add to make a new square."
00:13:42.300,00:13:45.090,"So let's call its area y squared."
00:13:45.090,00:13:50.090,"So x squared + x to the 4 + x to the 8 = y squared."
00:13:50.130,00:13:52.620,"Now, it's not hard to find solutions to this equation"
00:13:52.620,00:13:53.610,"in the real numbers."
00:13:53.610,00:13:55.740,"For example, set x equal to 1,"
00:13:55.740,00:13:58.350,"and you find y is root 3."
00:13:58.350,00:14:01.410,"In fact, we can make a plot of all the real number solutions"
00:14:01.410,00:14:02.910,"to this equation,"
00:14:02.910,00:14:05.790,"but Diophantus wasn't interested in real solutions."
00:14:05.790,00:14:07.620,"He wanted rational solutions."
00:14:07.620,00:14:10.770,"Solutions that are whole numbers or fractions."
00:14:10.770,00:14:13.170,"These are much harder to find."
00:14:13.170,00:14:17.040,"I mean, where would you even start? I mean, where would you even start?"
00:14:17.040,00:14:17.873,"- Like what do you do?"
00:14:17.873,00:14:19.020,"You have this cliff"
00:14:19.020,00:14:22.590,"and you're looking for anywhere to grab a hold of."
00:14:24.990,00:14:26.670,"- Well, in the late 1800s,"
00:14:26.670,00:14:28.830,"a mathematician named Kurt Hensel"
00:14:28.830,00:14:31.530,"tried to find solutions to equations like this one"
00:14:31.530,00:14:33.120,"in the form of an expansion"
00:14:33.120,00:14:35.700,"of increasing powers of primes."
00:14:35.700,00:14:37.320,"So working with the prime 3,"
00:14:37.320,00:14:40.307,"the solutions would take the form of x = x not"
00:14:40.307,00:14:45.307,"+ x1 times 3 + x2 times 3 squared + x3 times 3 cubed,"
00:14:46.260,00:14:47.580,"and so on,"
00:14:47.580,00:14:52.230,"and y would also be a similar expansion in powers of 3."
00:14:52.230,00:14:56.760,"Each of the coefficients would be either 0, 1, or 2."
00:14:56.760,00:14:58.890,"Now imagine inserting these expressions"
00:14:58.890,00:15:01.710,"into our equation for x and y,"
00:15:01.710,00:15:06.060,"and you can see it's going to get messy real fast,"
00:15:06.060,00:15:08.283,"but there is a way to simplify things."
00:15:09.600,00:15:13.320,"Say you wanted to write 17 in base 3."
00:15:13.320,00:15:16.530,"Well, one way to do it is to divide 17 by 3"
00:15:16.530,00:15:19.710,"and find the remainder, which in this case is 2."
00:15:19.710,00:15:23.280,"So we know the unit's digit of our base 3 number is 2."
00:15:23.280,00:15:27.600,"Next, divide 17 by 9, the next higher power of 3,"
00:15:27.600,00:15:29.460,"and you get a remainder of 8."
00:15:29.460,00:15:31.260,"Subtract off the 2 we found before"
00:15:31.260,00:15:34.380,"and you have 6 which is 2 x 3."
00:15:34.380,00:15:37.950,"So we know the second to last digit is 2."
00:15:37.950,00:15:42.540,"Next, divide 17 by 27, and you get a remainder of 17."
00:15:42.540,00:15:44.760,"Subtract off the 8 we've already accounted for"
00:15:44.760,00:15:48.210,"and you have 9, so the 9's digit is 1."
00:15:48.210,00:15:51.273,"So 17 in base 3 is 122."
00:15:52.560,00:15:56.520,"What we're doing here is a form of modular arithmetic."
00:15:56.520,00:15:59.730,"In modular arithmetic, numbers reset back to 0 once"
00:15:59.730,00:16:02.072,"they reach a certain value called the modulus."
00:16:02.072,00:16:04.830,"The hours on a clock work kinda like this"
00:16:04.830,00:16:06.660,"with a modulus of 12."
00:16:06.660,00:16:08.730,"The hours increase up to 11,"
00:16:08.730,00:16:13.260,"but then 12:00 is the same thing as 00:00."
00:16:13.260,00:16:14.520,"If it's 10 in the morning,"
00:16:14.520,00:16:18.090,"say what time will it be in four hours?"
00:16:18.090,00:16:21.900,"You could say 14, but usually, we'd say 2:00 PM"
00:16:21.900,00:16:25.590,"because 2 is 14 modulo 12,"
00:16:25.590,00:16:28.410,"it's two more than a multiple of 12."
00:16:28.410,00:16:29.640,"So in other words,"
00:16:29.640,00:16:33.290,"modular arithmetic is only about finding the remainder."
00:16:33.290,00:16:38.290,"36 modulo 10 or 36 mod 10 is 6, and 25 mod 5 is 0."
00:16:41.310,00:16:45.030,"- Mod 3 means your clock only has three numbers on it,"
00:16:45.030,00:16:48.213,"0, 1, and 2,"
00:16:49.110,00:16:51.480,"and if you multiply 2 by 2, you get a 4,"
00:16:51.480,00:16:53.490,"and 4 is the same thing as 04:00,"
00:16:53.490,00:16:55.593,"the same thing as 1:00 on a 3-hour clock."
00:16:57.390,00:16:58.770,"- [Derek] What's great about this approach"
00:16:58.770,00:17:00.810,"is it allows us to work out the coefficients"
00:17:00.810,00:17:02.940,"in our expansion one at a time"
00:17:02.940,00:17:05.430,"by first solving the equation mod 3,"
00:17:05.430,00:17:09.060,"and then mod 9, and then mod 27, and so on."
00:17:09.060,00:17:12.330,"So first, let's try to solve the equation mod 3."
00:17:12.330,00:17:15.480,"And since all the higher terms are divisible by 3,"
00:17:15.480,00:17:18.270,"they're all 0 if we're working mod 3."
00:17:18.270,00:17:21.347,"So we're left with x not squared + x not to the 4th"
00:17:21.347,00:17:25.167,"+ x not to the 8 = y not squared."
00:17:25.167,00:17:27.120,"And this will allow us to find the values"
00:17:27.120,00:17:31.317,"of x not and y not that satisfy the equation mod 3."
00:17:31.317,00:17:34.650,"Now we know that x not can be either 0, 1, or 2,"
00:17:34.650,00:17:38.490,"and y not can also be either 0, 1, or 2."
00:17:38.490,00:17:40.980,"If x is 0, then so is x squared,"
00:17:40.980,00:17:43.050,"x to the 4, and x to the 8."
00:17:43.050,00:17:45.450,"If x is 1, then x squared is 1,"
00:17:45.450,00:17:47.961,"and so is x to the 4, and x to the 8."
00:17:47.961,00:17:51.390,"If x is 2, then x squared is 4."
00:17:51.390,00:17:53.250,"But remember, we're working mod 3,"
00:17:53.250,00:17:56.760,"and 4, mod 3 is just 1."
00:17:56.760,00:17:59.640,"To find x to the 4, we can just square x squared,"
00:17:59.640,00:18:01.260,"so that also equals 1,"
00:18:01.260,00:18:05.190,"and squaring again, x to the 8 = 1."
00:18:05.190,00:18:08.730,"Now we can sum up x squared + x to the 4 + x to the 8"
00:18:08.730,00:18:11.700,"to find the left-hand side of the equation."
00:18:11.700,00:18:15.030,"If x is 0, then the sum is equal to 0."
00:18:15.030,00:18:18.270,"If x is 1 or 2, the sum is 3."
00:18:18.270,00:18:19.890,"But again, we're working mod 3,"
00:18:19.890,00:18:23.100,"so 3 is the same as 0."
00:18:23.100,00:18:25.290,"Now, let's calculate y squared."
00:18:25.290,00:18:27.780,"If y is 0, y squared is 0."
00:18:27.780,00:18:30.150,"If y is 1, y squared is 1."
00:18:30.150,00:18:32.640,"And if y is 2, then y squared is 4,"
00:18:32.640,00:18:35.670,"but again, 4 mod 3 is 1."
00:18:35.670,00:18:37.620,"Now, since for all values of x,"
00:18:37.620,00:18:39.870,"the left-hand side of the equation is 0,"
00:18:39.870,00:18:41.310,"the only value of y"
00:18:41.310,00:18:45.090,"that satisfies the equation is y = 0,"
00:18:45.090,00:18:48.600,"but x can be 0, 1, or 2."
00:18:48.600,00:18:50.700,"So we have three potential solutions"
00:18:50.700,00:18:53.160,"that satisfy our equation mod 3,"
00:18:53.160,00:18:57.240,"we've got 0, 0, 1, 0, and 2, 0."
00:18:57.240,00:18:59.190,"Now we shouldn't be surprised to find 0, 0"
00:18:59.190,00:19:02.460,"as a solution since x = 0 and y = 0"
00:19:02.460,00:19:04.860,"does satisfy the equation,"
00:19:04.860,00:19:07.680,"but squares of 0 size don't really count"
00:19:07.680,00:19:11.160,"as solutions to Diophantus' geometric problem."
00:19:11.160,00:19:14.190,"So let's try to expand on one of the other solutions."
00:19:14.190,00:19:16.080,"I'll pick 1, 0."
00:19:16.080,00:19:19.530,"This means x not = 1 and y not = 0"
00:19:19.530,00:19:22.230,"satisfies the equation mod 3."
00:19:22.230,00:19:24.360,"Now let's try to find x1,"
00:19:24.360,00:19:27.900,"and we'll do this by solving the equation mod 9."
00:19:27.900,00:19:29.580,"All of the terms higher than x1"
00:19:29.580,00:19:33.570,"have a factor of 9 in them, so they're all 0 mod 9."
00:19:33.570,00:19:36.300,"So we're left with this expression."
00:19:36.300,00:19:37.590,"Expanding out the first term,"
00:19:37.590,00:19:41.940,"we have 1 + 6x1 + 9x1 squared."
00:19:41.940,00:19:43.500,"But again, since we're working mod 9,"
00:19:43.500,00:19:45.600,"the last part is 0."
00:19:45.600,00:19:48.600,"The next term is just the first term squared."
00:19:48.600,00:19:53.600,"So that equals 1 + 12x1 + 36x1 squared,"
00:19:53.910,00:19:58.910,"but 36 is 9 x 4, so that's 0 mod 9, and 12 mod 9 is 3."
00:19:59.910,00:20:01.880,"So we have 1 + 3x1."
00:20:02.730,00:20:04.770,"The final term is just that squared,"
00:20:04.770,00:20:08.010,"so 1 + 6x1 + 9x1 squared."
00:20:08.010,00:20:09.450,"Again, the last part is 0."
00:20:09.450,00:20:12.813,"So on the left-hand side, we have 3 + 15x1."
00:20:13.710,00:20:17.610,"And on the right-hand side, we have 0 + 9y1 squared,"
00:20:17.610,00:20:20.820,"which is also 0 because it contains a factor of 9."
00:20:20.820,00:20:24.870,"So 3 + 15x1 equals 0."
00:20:24.870,00:20:27.150,"Now remember, since we're working mod 9,"
00:20:27.150,00:20:31.350,"the 0 on the right-hand side represents any multiple of 9."
00:20:31.350,00:20:34.020,"So in this case, if x1 = 1,"
00:20:34.020,00:20:39.020,"then 3 + 15 = 18, which is a multiple of 9, so it's 0."
00:20:39.360,00:20:42.753,"So x1 = 1 is a solution to the equation."
00:20:43.590,00:20:45.510,"Let's find one more term of the expansion"
00:20:45.510,00:20:47.673,"by solving the equation mod 27."
00:20:49.320,00:20:51.990,"Again, all the terms with 3 raised to the power of 3"
00:20:51.990,00:20:54.780,"or higher contain a factor of 27."
00:20:54.780,00:20:58.290,"So there's 0, leaving only this expression,"
00:20:58.290,00:21:01.350,"but we know x not and x1 are equal to 1."
00:21:01.350,00:21:03.810,"- But right now, we've learned nothing about y1"
00:21:03.810,00:21:07.380,"because when we square, anything can happen."
00:21:07.380,00:21:09.420,"If we find a good solution in x,"
00:21:09.420,00:21:11.400,"it'll come with a good solution in y."
00:21:11.400,00:21:13.380,"- [Derek] So we can simplify to this."
00:21:13.380,00:21:18.380,"Expanding again, we get 16 + 18x2 + 81x squared,"
00:21:18.510,00:21:22.290,"but 81 is 27 x 3, so that's 0."
00:21:22.290,00:21:24.510,"The next term is the square of the first."
00:21:24.510,00:21:28.063,"So 256 + 576x2 + 324x2 squared."
00:21:30.900,00:21:34.860,"But 324 is 27 x 12, so that's 0."
00:21:34.860,00:21:36.660,"And since we're working mod 27,"
00:21:36.660,00:21:38.430,"we can simplify this down."
00:21:38.430,00:21:41.700,"576 is nine more than a multiple of 27,"
00:21:41.700,00:21:45.450,"and 256 is 13 more than a multiple of 27."
00:21:45.450,00:21:48.420,"So we're left with 13 + 9x2,"
00:21:48.420,00:21:50.520,"and the last term is just that squared."
00:21:50.520,00:21:55.520,"So 169 + 234x2 + 81x2 squared,"
00:21:56.070,00:21:59.850,"which reduces to 7 + 18x2."
00:21:59.850,00:22:03.780,"The right-hand side reduces to 0 + 81y squared,"
00:22:03.780,00:22:06.330,"which is, again, 0."
00:22:06.330,00:22:10.800,"So we have 36 + 45x2 equals 0,"
00:22:10.800,00:22:15.800,"which mod 27 is the same as 9 + 18x2 = 0."
00:22:15.960,00:22:20.960,"So x2 must be equal to 1, 9 + 18 is 27,"
00:22:21.540,00:22:24.510,"which mod 27 is 0."
00:22:24.510,00:22:27.300,"So what we've discovered is the first three coefficients"
00:22:27.300,00:22:30.180,"in our expansion are all 1."
00:22:30.180,00:22:31.560,"And in fact, if you kept going"
00:22:31.560,00:22:34.920,"with modulus 81, 243, and so on,"
00:22:34.920,00:22:38.580,"you would find that all of the coefficients are 1."
00:22:38.580,00:22:41.310,"So the number that solves Diophantus' equation"
00:22:41.310,00:22:44.370,"about the squares is actually a 3-adic number"
00:22:44.370,00:22:46.173,"where all the digits are 1s."
00:22:47.340,00:22:49.230,"But how do we make sense of this?"
00:22:49.230,00:22:51.420,"What does this number equal?"
00:22:51.420,00:22:54.060,"- And of course, this number makes no sense at all,"
00:22:54.060,00:22:55.710,"at least not as a real number."
00:22:55.710,00:22:57.180,"- [Derek] Well, remember that this is just another way"
00:22:57.180,00:23:00.333,"of writing 1 x 3 to the 0 + 1 x 3"
00:23:00.333,00:23:05.333,"+ 1 x 3 squared + 1 x 3 cubed, and so on."
00:23:05.430,00:23:09.330,"So each term is just 3 times the term before it."
00:23:09.330,00:23:11.700,"This is a geometric series."
00:23:11.700,00:23:14.220,"And to find the sum of an infinite geometric series,"
00:23:14.220,00:23:17.880,"you can use the equation 1/1 - lambda"
00:23:17.880,00:23:21.240,"where lambda is the ratio of one term to the previous one."
00:23:21.240,00:23:23.580,"So in this case, it's 3."
00:23:23.580,00:23:24.960,"Now, I know for this to work,"
00:23:24.960,00:23:27.480,"lambda is meant to be strictly less than 1"
00:23:27.480,00:23:29.340,"because otherwise, the terms keep growing"
00:23:29.340,00:23:30.720,"and the sum doesn't converge,"
00:23:30.720,00:23:32.790,"it just diverges to infinity."
00:23:32.790,00:23:34.410,"I promise I'll come back to this,"
00:23:34.410,00:23:37.620,"but for now, let's just say that lambda = 3"
00:23:37.620,00:23:39.420,"and see what happens."
00:23:39.420,00:23:43.143,"Well, then we have 1/1 - 3, which is -1/2."
00:23:44.580,00:23:46.590,"So if we believe this formula,"
00:23:46.590,00:23:51.590,"then x = -1/2 should be a solution to our original equation."
00:23:52.560,00:23:53.520,"If we sub it in,"
00:23:53.520,00:23:57.900,"we get x squared is 1/4, x to the 4 is 1/16,"
00:23:57.900,00:24:01.680,"and x to the 8 is 1/256."
00:24:01.680,00:24:04.170,"Let's put all of these over a common denominator."
00:24:04.170,00:24:09.170,"So a quarter becomes 64/256, now 16th is 16/256."
00:24:11.070,00:24:15.033,"And if we add them all together, we get 81/256,"
00:24:16.770,00:24:20.490,"which is indeed the area of a square"
00:24:20.490,00:24:24.060,"with sides of length 9/16ths."
00:24:24.060,00:24:26.550,"We have found a rational solution"
00:24:26.550,00:24:29.310,"to Diophantus' sum of squares problem."
00:24:29.310,00:24:32.370,"The first square has sides of length 1/2,"
00:24:32.370,00:24:34.500,"the second has sides of length 1/4,"
00:24:34.500,00:24:36.660,"the third has sides of length 1/16,"
00:24:36.660,00:24:39.360,"and all three squares together make a square"
00:24:39.360,00:24:41.883,"with sides of length 9/16ths."
00:24:43.200,00:24:44.880,"To find this solution,"
00:24:44.880,00:24:48.330,"we used new seemingly absurd numbers, p-adics,"
00:24:48.330,00:24:50.760,"infinite digits going off to the left of the decimal point,"
00:24:50.760,00:24:52.770,"implying an infinite expansion"
00:24:52.770,00:24:54.750,"of increasing powers of 3."
00:24:54.750,00:24:57.030,"Then we used the geometric series formula"
00:24:57.030,00:24:58.950,"to find that an infinite string"
00:24:58.950,00:25:01.950,"of 1s in 3-adic notation is actually -1/2."
00:25:01.950,00:25:03.900,"This works, even though the ratio of each term,"
00:25:03.900,00:25:05.490,"the previous 1 is 3."
00:25:05.490,00:25:07.830,"So by common sense, the series shouldn't have converged,"
00:25:07.830,00:25:10.230,"it should have blown up to infinity."
00:25:10.230,00:25:14.283,"So the real question is how did this work?"
00:25:15.307,00:25:17.550,"Well, the key idea is that the geometry"
00:25:17.550,00:25:19.440,"of the p-adics is totally different"
00:25:19.440,00:25:20.910,"from that of the real numbers."
00:25:20.910,00:25:24.510,"In fact, they don't exist on a number line at all."
00:25:24.510,00:25:26.940,"One way to visualize them is with something"
00:25:26.940,00:25:28.620,"like a growing tree."
00:25:28.620,00:25:31.350,"For the 3-adic integers we've been working with,"
00:25:31.350,00:25:33.960,"3 base cylinders represent the unit's digit"
00:25:33.960,00:25:37.560,"or x not being 0, 1, or 2."
00:25:37.560,00:25:40.500,"Above each cylinder is a trio of shorter cylinders"
00:25:40.500,00:25:43.620,"corresponding to the 3s digit or x1."
00:25:43.620,00:25:46.320,"And we continue in this way forever"
00:25:46.320,00:25:49.620,"making an infinite triply branching tree."
00:25:49.620,00:25:51.180,"Looking down from above,"
00:25:51.180,00:25:53.880,"it looks like a Sierpinski gasket."
00:25:53.880,00:25:56.250,"Each 3-adic number is represented here"
00:25:56.250,00:25:58.410,"as a stack of infinite cylinders"
00:25:58.410,00:26:01.950,"that get shorter and narrower as they go up."
00:26:01.950,00:26:02.820,"And this actually"
00:26:02.820,00:26:05.970,"reflects the relative contributions each successive cylinder"
00:26:05.970,00:26:08.700,"makes to the value of the 3-adic number."
00:26:08.700,00:26:10.470,"Contrary to what you'd expect,"
00:26:10.470,00:26:13.530,"the coefficients multiplying higher powers of 3"
00:26:13.530,00:26:16.800,"actually make finer and finer adjustments. 547 00:26:18,300 --&gt; 00:26:20,790 So when we calculated successive coefficients"
00:26:20.790,00:26:23.040,"to solve Diophantus' squares problem,"
00:26:23.040,00:26:26.580,"we were actually zooming in more and more accurately"
00:26:26.580,00:26:28.170,"on the solution."
00:26:28.170,00:26:30.120,"- This is the feeling of slowly zooming in"
00:26:30.120,00:26:31.770,"on the value of a number."
00:26:31.770,00:26:33.990,"- [Derek] Normally, we think of the size of a number"
00:26:33.990,00:26:36.480,"as being determined approximately at least"
00:26:36.480,00:26:39.750,"by how many digits it has to the left of the decimal point."
00:26:39.750,00:26:43.620,"But here, all the numbers have infinitely many digits."
00:26:43.620,00:26:46.080,"So people realize that to determine the distance"
00:26:46.080,00:26:47.400,"between two numbers,"
00:26:47.400,00:26:50.130,"we need to look at the lowest level of the tower"
00:26:50.130,00:26:52.080,"where they disagree."
00:26:52.080,00:26:54.900,"If two numbers differ in the unit's place,"
00:26:54.900,00:26:57.690,"we say their separation is 1."
00:26:57.690,00:26:59.910,"But if they differ in the 27th's place,"
00:26:59.910,00:27:04.620,"we say they differ not by 27, but by 1/27."
00:27:04.620,00:27:06.270,"In the world of p-adics,"
00:27:06.270,00:27:09.420,"what we're used to thinking of as big is small,"
00:27:09.420,00:27:12.218,"and vice versa."
00:27:14.540,00:27:17.810,"- If we have a number, let's say, s1,"
00:27:17.810,00:27:19.520,"which will be some sequence"
00:27:19.520,00:27:25.773,"like 2 x 1 + 1 x 3 + 0 x 3 squared"
00:27:25.773,00:27:32.799,"+ 1 x 3 cubed + 2 x 3 to the 4th, and so on"
00:27:34.790,00:27:36.980,"we'll be close to another number"
00:27:36.980,00:27:38.725,"with a similar expansion"
00:27:38.725,00:27:43.700,"except at the, let's say, 3 to the third place,"
00:27:43.700,00:27:45.440,"I change a digit,"
00:27:45.440,00:27:47.300,"and then doesn't matter what I do after that."
00:27:47.300,00:27:49.340,"The digits can be all the same or all different."
00:27:49.340,00:27:52.280,"These two numbers will say that their distance,"
00:27:52.280,00:27:55.820,"their 3-adic distance is roughly of size,"
00:27:55.820,00:27:57.260,"the first place where they go wrong."
00:27:57.260,00:27:58.713,"So this'll be 3 to the -3."
00:28:00.020,00:28:03.410,"- Am I supposed to think of the 3s"
00:28:03.410,00:28:06.680,"as kind of like, the bigger they are,"
00:28:06.680,00:28:08.150,"the smaller the numbers"
00:28:08.150,00:28:10.340,"that they're multiplying, or something?"
00:28:10.340,00:28:11.173,"- Exactly."
00:28:11.173,00:28:13.730,"In the 3-adics, we want numbers to be close"
00:28:13.730,00:28:16.910,"when they agree up to large powers of 3,"
00:28:16.910,00:28:20.990,"so that if they agree up to 10 3-adic places,"
00:28:20.990,00:28:24.350,"then this has a distance like 3 to the -10."
00:28:24.350,00:28:26.360,"- And it turns out that if you do this crazy thing,"
00:28:26.360,00:28:28.490,"swap what we think of as big and small,"
00:28:28.490,00:28:30.470,"then all the other laws of mathematics"
00:28:30.470,00:28:32.690,"work out in the usual way."
00:28:32.690,00:28:34.730,"This is why the geometric sum worked out,"
00:28:34.730,00:28:37.483,"even though we thought it would blow up to infinity."
00:28:37.483,00:28:40.580,"- You have to open your mind to other notions of size,"
00:28:40.580,00:28:42.680,"and when you do, this whole other world appears,"
00:28:42.680,00:28:44.388,"and it's a very useful world,"
00:28:44.388,00:28:47.060,"just like negative numbers became useful,"
00:28:47.060,00:28:49.640,"just like square roots of negative numbers became useful."
00:28:49.640,00:28:51.735,"- This feels even crazier"
00:28:51.735,00:28:55.970,"than negative numbers or square roots of negatives."
00:28:55.970,00:28:57.950,"- Just 'cause it's less familiar."
00:28:57.950,00:29:00.650,"- [Derek] And you can prove this notion of size"
00:29:00.650,00:29:03.863,"fits the criteria you would want for an absolute value."
00:29:04.760,00:29:06.800,"- What do we want an absolute value to be?"
00:29:06.800,00:29:08.750,"It should be non-negative."
00:29:08.750,00:29:11.060,"So the absolute value of any number, x,"
00:29:11.060,00:29:12.110,"should be non-negative,"
00:29:12.110,00:29:14.030,"and the absolute value should be 0"
00:29:14.030,00:29:16.250,"if and only if that number is itself 0."
00:29:16.250,00:29:18.230,"So that's called positive definite."
00:29:18.230,00:29:19.460,"So it should be multiplicative."
00:29:19.460,00:29:22.370,"If I take x times y and I multiply those two,"
00:29:22.370,00:29:23.930,"that should be the same as the absolute value"
00:29:23.930,00:29:26.270,"of x times the absolute value of y."
00:29:26.270,00:29:28.460,"And I want one more property,"
00:29:28.460,00:29:31.340,"which is that if you add x and y,"
00:29:31.340,00:29:33.740,"should that be the same as the absolute value"
00:29:33.740,00:29:35.990,"of x plus the absolute value of Y? No."
00:29:35.990,00:29:37.540,"But it should be, at most, the sum, right?"
00:29:37.540,00:29:39.650,"This is the triangle inequality."
00:29:39.650,00:29:40.850,"So we have multiplicativity,"
00:29:40.850,00:29:43.310,"positive definites, and the triangle inequality."
00:29:43.310,00:29:46.460,"You give me only these three very abstract things"
00:29:46.460,00:29:48.950,"and I can prove that your function is,"
00:29:48.950,00:29:51.050,"in fact, the usual absolute value"
00:29:51.050,00:29:53.690,"or one of these p-adic absolute values"
00:29:53.690,00:29:57.800,"or the thing that gives 0 to 0 and 1 to everything else."
00:29:57.800,00:29:59.750,"So that's the trivial absolute value."
00:29:59.750,00:30:01.310,"These are the only games you can play"
00:30:01.310,00:30:04.880,"on the rational numbers that give you absolute values"
00:30:04.880,00:30:07.250,"that behave the way we want them to."
00:30:07.250,00:30:08.360,"- [Derek] This geometry"
00:30:08.360,00:30:10.460,"makes the p-adics much more disconnected"
00:30:10.460,00:30:12.320,"when compared to the real numbers."
00:30:12.320,00:30:15.380,"And this is actually useful for finding rational solutions"
00:30:15.380,00:30:16.550,"to an equation."
00:30:16.550,00:30:18.590,"There are many fewer p-adic solutions"
00:30:18.590,00:30:21.620,"in a neighborhood of a rational solution."
00:30:21.620,00:30:23.420,"If we tried the same strategy"
00:30:23.420,00:30:26.420,"of solving Diophantus' squares problem digit by digit"
00:30:26.420,00:30:29.660,"in the real numbers, it would be doomed to fail"
00:30:29.660,00:30:32.540,"because there are simply too many real solutions all"
00:30:32.540,00:30:33.590,"over the place."
00:30:33.590,00:30:35.273,"They get in the way."
00:30:36.710,00:30:39.440,"In a groundbreaking pair of papers in 1995,"
00:30:39.440,00:30:40.760,"one by Andrew Wiles,"
00:30:40.760,00:30:43.280,"and another by Wiles and Richard Taylor,"
00:30:43.280,00:30:46.220,"they finally proved Fermat's last theorem,"
00:30:46.220,00:30:48.920,"but the proof could not possibly have been the one Fermat"
00:30:48.920,00:30:50.450,"alluded to in the margin"
00:30:50.450,00:30:54.230,"because it made heavy use of p-adic numbers."
00:30:54.230,00:30:57.200,"- Wiles' proof of Fermat's last theorem"
00:30:57.200,00:30:59.060,"used the prime 3, and then at some point,"
00:30:59.060,00:31:00.230,"he got stuck with the prime 3,"
00:31:00.230,00:31:02.060,"and he had to switch to the prime 5."
00:31:02.060,00:31:04.190,"And this is literally called the three, five trick."
00:31:04.190,00:31:05.030,"There was something that worked"
00:31:05.030,00:31:06.560,"for the prime 3 most of the time,"
00:31:06.560,00:31:07.550,"but sometimes it didn't work,"
00:31:07.550,00:31:08.900,"and when it didn't work for the prime 3,"
00:31:08.900,00:31:10.400,"it did work for the prime 5."
00:31:10.400,00:31:13.160,"Each prime gives you a completely unrelated number system,"
00:31:13.160,00:31:14.930,"just like these number systems are unrelated"
00:31:14.930,00:31:16.610,"to the real numbers."
00:31:16.610,00:31:18.350,"- There is a great quote I like"
00:31:18.350,00:31:21.110,"by a Japanese mathematician, Kazuya Kato."
00:31:21.110,00:31:23.690,"He says, ""Real numbers are like the sun"
00:31:23.690,00:31:26.240,"and the p-adics are like the stars."
00:31:26.240,00:31:28.550,"The sun blocks out the stars during the day,"
00:31:28.550,00:31:29.960,"and humans are asleep at night"
00:31:29.960,00:31:31.490,"and don't see the stars,"
00:31:31.490,00:31:34.550,"even though they are just as important."""
00:31:34.550,00:31:36.050,"Well, I hope this video has revealed"
00:31:36.050,00:31:39.498,"at least a glimpse of those stars to you."
00:31:44.336,00:31:47.060,"The discovery of p-adic numbers is a great reminder"
00:31:47.060,00:31:50.030,"of just how much we have yet to discover in mathematics,"
00:31:50.030,00:31:51.920,"not to mention science, computer science,"
00:31:51.920,00:31:54.380,"and just about every technical field."
00:31:54.380,00:31:56.540,"They inspire us to find new connections"
00:31:56.540,00:31:58.790,"and even make discoveries ourselves."
00:31:58.790,00:32:00.230,"If you were inspired by the stories"
00:32:00.230,00:32:02.300,"of Diophantus, Fermat, and Hensel,"
