00:00:00.200,00:00:02.200,"This is uh representing the earth."
00:00:03.449,00:00:05.300,"and this represents, what do you think?"
00:00:05.300,00:00:06.990,"The moon?"
00:00:06.990,00:00:10.400,"Yes. now our first challenge is how far apart are they"
00:00:10.400,00:00:12.400,"like, roughly"
00:00:12.400,00:00:14.300,"like roughly, about that much?"
00:00:14.500,00:00:15.200,"Okay."
00:00:15.200,00:00:17.900,"Uh... I guess maybe about that far? maybe?"
00:00:17.900,00:00:19.800,"About that far? Yeah, yeah maybe."
00:00:19.800,00:00:21.400,"Roughly? Okay."
00:00:23.200,00:00:25.500,"about like that?"
00:00:25.500,00:00:28.470,"im guessing yeah"
00:00:28.470,00:00:31.859,"this far but then it's like here somewhere"
00:00:31.859,00:00:36.630,"rough right there and steal all right let's let's say stand here"
00:00:36.630,00:00:39.630,"ok tonight yeah yeah great"
00:00:40.800,00:00:43.950,"scene with panels in here ok"
00:00:43.950,00:00:48.000,"these are some images i found on a google image search for the earth and"
00:00:48.000,00:00:52.890,"the moon diagrams that are not to scale are pretty common and I understand why"
00:00:52.890,00:00:57.600,"we make them so you can show the detail without showing all that  uninteresting"
00:00:57.600,00:01:02.670,"space in between but they can have a problematic effect on learning because"
00:01:02.670,00:01:06.119,"they give people the wrong idea about the relative proximity of things"
00:01:06.119,00:01:09.270,"now if we want to talk about the distance between the Earth and the moon"
00:01:09.270,00:01:16.800,"yeah it's actually about here"
00:01:17.310,00:01:22.740,"think about this it takes like one second to go from the earth to the moon"
00:01:22.740,00:01:28.590,"takes eight minutes for light to travel to the Sun and four years to go to our"
00:01:28.590,00:01:32.970,"nearest star and then consider that there are a hundred billion stars in our"
00:01:32.970,00:01:39.420,"galaxy and as far as we know a hundred billion galaxies in the universe the"
00:01:39.420,00:01:44.009,"universe truly is bigger than we can imagine and certainly bigger than we can"
00:01:44.009,00:01:44.640,"draw it to scale"
