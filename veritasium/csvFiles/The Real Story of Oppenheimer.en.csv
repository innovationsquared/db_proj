00:01:01.650,00:01:04.260,"When J. Robert Oppenheimer was 21,"
00:01:04.260,00:01:07.320,"he placed an apple laced with toxic chemicals"
00:01:07.320,00:01:09.179,"on the desk of his physics tutor."
00:01:09.179,00:01:11.250,"The tutor, Patrick Blackett,"
00:01:11.250,00:01:14.070,"was an experimentalist and he had hounded Robert"
00:01:14.070,00:01:15.540,"to do more of what he thought"
00:01:15.540,00:01:18.584,"Robert wasn't very good at, experimental work."
00:01:18.584,00:01:21.810,"Oppenheimer had already been spending his days in a corner"
00:01:21.810,00:01:24.060,"of JJ Thompson's basement laboratory,"
00:01:24.060,00:01:26.460,"attempting to make thin films of beryllium,"
00:01:26.460,00:01:28.950,"which were used to study electrons."
00:01:28.950,00:01:32.463,"But Oppenheimer was clumsy and not good at this work."
00:01:33.870,00:01:36.240,"He was soon avoiding his duties in the lab,"
00:01:36.240,00:01:38.100,"spending his time listening to lectures"
00:01:38.100,00:01:39.900,"and reading physics journals."
00:01:39.900,00:01:43.680,"It was 1925 and the 21 year old Oppenheimer was becoming"
00:01:43.680,00:01:46.623,"fascinated by the new field of quantum mechanics."
00:01:47.520,00:01:50.550,"Despite being surrounded by brilliant physicists"
00:01:50.550,00:01:52.740,"like Rutherford and Chadwick,"
00:01:52.740,00:01:55.380,"Oppenheimer was deeply unhappy."
00:01:55.380,00:01:58.110,"He wrote, ""I'm having a pretty bad time."
00:01:58.110,00:02:00.060,"The lab work is a terrible bore,"
00:02:00.060,00:02:03.090,"and I'm so bad at it that it's impossible to feel"
00:02:03.090,00:02:04.518,"that I'm learning anything."""
00:02:04.518,00:02:06.060,"A friend walked in on him,"
00:02:06.060,00:02:07.500,"lying on the floor of his room,"
00:02:07.500,00:02:10.080,"which he called ""A miserable hole"","
00:02:10.080,00:02:13.925,"groaning and rolling from side to side in emotional anguish."
00:02:13.925,00:02:16.620,"It was in this state that Robert"
00:02:16.620,00:02:19.080,"attempted to poison Blackett."
00:02:19.080,00:02:21.150,"The specifics are lost to history."
00:02:21.150,00:02:23.957,"There are conflicting reports if Oppenheimer used cyanide"
00:02:23.957,00:02:26.010,"or something he found in the lab,"
00:02:26.010,00:02:28.590,"which would've just made Blackett sick."
00:02:28.590,00:02:30.525,"This story sounds unbelievable,"
00:02:30.525,00:02:33.597,"but Oppenheimer himself confirmed it."
00:02:33.597,00:02:36.524,"Luckily, Blackett did not eat the apple,"
00:02:36.524,00:02:39.000,"but the attempted poisoning became known"
00:02:39.000,00:02:41.790,"to the Cambridge University authorities."
00:02:41.790,00:02:43.440,"Robert's parents were visiting their son"
00:02:43.440,00:02:44.610,"from the US at the time,"
00:02:44.610,00:02:48.030,"and Julius Oppenheimer successfully lobbied Cambridge"
00:02:48.030,00:02:51.630,"not to press criminal charges. Due to his family's wealth,"
00:02:51.630,00:02:53.970,"Robert wasn't even expelled from Cambridge"
00:02:53.970,00:02:56.499,"on the condition that he had periodic counseling sessions"
00:02:56.499,00:02:59.207,"with a psychiatrist in London."
00:02:59.207,00:03:01.260,"(train horn blaring)"
00:03:01.260,00:03:02.640,"In the summer of 1926,"
00:03:02.640,00:03:05.700,"Robert traveled to the University of Göttingen."
00:03:05.700,00:03:08.130,"The chairman of the department was Max Born,"
00:03:08.130,00:03:11.269,"who just two years earlier had coined the term,"

00:03:13.260,00:03:16.440,"Born was reportedly a thoughtful and gentle teacher"
00:03:16.440,00:03:18.930,"and had nurtured the work of Werner Heisenberg,"
00:03:18.930,00:03:21.030,"Wolfgang Pauli, Enrico Fermi,"
00:03:21.030,00:03:22.290,"and Eugene Wigner,"
00:03:22.290,00:03:24.678,"basically the who's who of quantum mechanics."
00:03:24.678,00:03:28.140,"The class that Oppenheimer was in was also extraordinary,"
00:03:28.140,00:03:31.383,"including luminaries like Paul Dirac and John Von Neumann,"
00:03:32.220,00:03:34.130,"where the academic culture at Cambridge focused on"
00:03:34.130,00:03:36.090,"experimental physics."
00:03:36.090,00:03:38.700,"Göttingen was all about theoretical physics,"
00:03:38.700,00:03:41.040,"and under Max Born's mentorship,"
00:03:41.040,00:03:42.660,"Oppenheimer thrived."
00:03:42.660,00:03:44.280,"His mental health improved,"
00:03:44.280,00:03:46.320,"and he found a community of people who were"
00:03:46.320,00:03:49.023,"as obsessed with physics as he was."
00:03:49.980,00:03:52.200,"On November 14th, 1926,"
00:03:52.200,00:03:54.596,"Robert wrote to Frank, his younger brother,"

00:04:22.171,00:04:23.070,"All in all,"
00:04:23.070,00:04:24.585,"he published more than a dozen papers"
00:04:24.585,00:04:26.883,"in the two years he was at Göttingen."
00:04:26.883,00:04:30.570,"Many of them expanded upon the work of Werner Heisenberg,"
00:04:30.570,00:04:33.001,"who was just three years older than Oppenheimer."
00:04:33.001,00:04:36.240,"The two eventually met in 1927,"
00:04:36.240,00:04:39.480,"the same year Heisenberg published his groundbreaking paper"
00:04:39.480,00:04:41.486,"on the Quantum uncertainty principle."
00:04:41.486,00:04:42.840,"By all accounts,"
00:04:42.840,00:04:44.830,"the pair got along well."
00:04:44.830,00:04:47.730,"There was no way to know that just 15 years later,"

00:04:57.226,00:04:58.350,"At the time,"
00:04:58.350,00:05:01.350,"it was thought that getting significant amounts of energy"
00:05:01.350,00:05:04.950,"out of radioactive atoms was impossible."
00:05:04.950,00:05:07.230,"Ever since the discovery of radioactivity"

00:05:42.480,00:05:45.057,"would have to be shattered at will."""
00:05:46.260,00:05:49.183,"So how would you break an atomic nucleus?"
00:05:49.183,00:05:51.240,"Well, you could take a proton"
00:05:51.240,00:05:53.730,"and accelerate it through a large electric field"
00:05:53.730,00:05:56.580,"and then smash it into a nucleus."
00:05:56.580,00:05:58.617,"This is exactly what John Cockcroft"
00:05:58.617,00:06:00.930,"and Ernest Walton did in 1932."
00:06:00.930,00:06:04.560,"They accelerated protons into lithium nuclei,"
00:06:04.560,00:06:05.526,"breaking them apart."
00:06:05.526,00:06:08.982,"The pair would later win a Nobel Prize for this work,"
00:06:08.982,00:06:11.790,"but a proton is positively charged,"
00:06:11.790,00:06:14.220,"so it's repelled by all nuclei,"
00:06:14.220,00:06:16.650,"which are also positively charged."
00:06:16.650,00:06:19.350,"So to give them a hope of overcoming this barrier,"
00:06:19.350,00:06:23.610,"Cockcroft and Walton had to use 250,000 volts"
00:06:23.610,00:06:25.440,"to accelerate the protons."
00:06:25.440,00:06:28.710,"Even then, only about one in a billion protons"
00:06:28.710,00:06:31.920,"actually hit and split a lithium nucleus,"
00:06:31.920,00:06:35.403,"so this would not be an effective way to get energy."
00:06:36.240,00:06:38.133,"But there is another way."
00:06:39.660,00:06:42.720,"In 1932, the neutron was discovered"
00:06:42.720,00:06:46.110,"this subatomic particle that's about 0.1%"
00:06:46.110,00:06:47.640,"heavier than a proton,"
00:06:47.640,00:06:49.468,"and it has no electric charge,"
00:06:49.468,00:06:53.760,"so a neutron would not be repelled from a nucleus."

00:06:55.410,00:06:58.950,"Leo Szilard was thinking about how you could use neutrons"

00:15:55.980,00:15:58.770,"That amount is known as the critical mass."
00:15:58.770,00:16:00.120,"With uranium-235,"
00:16:00.120,00:16:02.700,"you need about 52 kilograms."

00:16:06.230,00:16:08.700,"If you use plutonium-239,"
00:16:08.700,00:16:10.260,"the critical mass is much smaller,"
00:16:10.260,00:16:12.120,"only around 10 kilograms,"
00:16:12.120,00:16:16.170,"which would create a sphere only 10 centimeters wide."
00:16:16.170,00:16:17.370,"For the first few years,"
00:16:17.370,00:16:20.790,"the scientists worked on a bomb with a gun type design."
00:16:20.790,00:16:22.590,"Inside a gun type bomb,"
00:16:22.590,00:16:24.800,"you have two slabs of uranium-235,"
00:16:24.800,00:16:27.720,"both of which are below the critical mass."
00:16:27.720,00:16:31.320,"Then using a conventional explosive like cordite,"
00:16:31.320,00:16:34.620,"you rapidly fire one towards the other."
00:16:34.620,00:16:38.430,"So the combined mass is higher than the critical mass."
00:16:38.430,00:16:41.850,"When the uranium bullet is about 25 centimeters away,"
00:16:41.850,00:16:44.280,"the nuclear chain reaction begins"
00:16:44.280,00:16:47.610,"resulting in an atomic explosion."
00:16:47.610,00:16:49.290,"Despite the simple design,"
00:16:49.290,00:16:51.180,"it is not very efficient."
00:16:51.180,00:16:53.818,"Only a small percentage of the uranium undergoes fission,"
00:16:53.818,00:16:57.210,"so the total yield of the bomb is much smaller."
00:16:57.210,00:17:00.090,"You also run into some unexpected problems,"
00:17:00.090,00:17:01.920,"like how do you make sure the uranium"
00:17:01.920,00:17:04.185,"slides smoothly through the barrel?"
00:17:04.185,00:17:08.190,"Well, you use oil to lubricate the barrel,"
00:17:08.190,00:17:10.650,"but all the synthetic oils the scientists tried"
00:17:10.650,00:17:12.120,"would dry up."
00:17:12.120,00:17:12.960,"In the end,"
00:17:12.960,00:17:15.720,"the only oil they could find that would work"
00:17:15.720,00:17:18.393,"was the oil from sperm whales."
00:17:20.400,00:17:25.400,"Only about 0.7% of naturally occurring uranium is U235,"
00:17:25.620,00:17:28.440,"the fissile fuel for nuclear bombs."
00:17:28.440,00:17:31.050,"When U235 absorbs a neutron,"
00:17:31.050,00:17:33.540,"it briefly becomes U236,"
00:17:33.540,00:17:36.300,"and then it rips itself roughly in half"
00:17:36.300,00:17:40.560,"and releases on average 2.4 neutrons per fission."
00:17:40.560,00:17:42.480,"But when you get uranium outta the ground,"
00:17:42.480,00:17:44.490,"most of it is U238,"
00:17:44.490,00:17:46.830,"which doesn't undergo fission."
00:17:46.830,00:17:48.060,"So to make a nuclear bomb,"
00:17:48.060,00:17:51.028,"the scientists use gigantic mass spectrometers"
00:17:51.028,00:17:55.200,"to separate out and concentrate the U235,"
00:17:55.200,00:17:57.960,"and the resulting substance was uranium"
00:17:57.960,00:18:01.290,"with a much higher concentration of U235."
00:18:01.290,00:18:04.320,"In other words, it was enriched."
00:18:04.320,00:18:06.810,"There was another option though."
00:18:06.810,00:18:08.490,"In early 1941,"
00:18:08.490,00:18:12.180,"a new element was discovered or rather synthesized."
00:18:12.180,00:18:15.570,"When a neutron is absorbed by a nucleus of uranium-238,"
00:18:15.570,00:18:18.257,"it turns into uranium-239."
00:18:18.257,00:18:20.580,"U239 is unstable,"
00:18:20.580,00:18:22.620,"so it decays into Neptunium,"
00:18:22.620,00:18:24.573,"which then becomes plutonium."
00:18:25.710,00:18:28.230,"There are three things that matter for this story."
00:18:28.230,00:18:30.022,"First is that plutonium-239"
00:18:30.022,00:18:32.430,"is a great fuel for a nuclear bomb."
00:18:32.430,00:18:35.490,"It has a critical mass of only about 10 kilograms."
00:18:35.490,00:18:39.492,"Second, it is cheaper to make than to separate uranium-235"
00:18:39.492,00:18:42.060,"and third, it reacts too quickly"
00:18:42.060,00:18:44.040,"to be used in a gun type device."
00:18:44.040,00:18:44.873,"It would fizzle,"
00:18:44.873,00:18:46.950,"meaning only a tiny fraction of the fuel"
00:18:46.950,00:18:49.050,"would undergo fission."
00:18:49.050,00:18:51.831,"But there is a way to make a bomb using plutonium."
00:18:51.831,00:18:54.780,"Critical mass changes depending on the density"
00:18:54.780,00:18:56.100,"of the material."
00:18:56.100,00:18:57.745,"Under normal pressure conditions,"
00:18:57.745,00:19:02.010,"six kilograms of plutonium-239 won't explode."
00:19:02.010,00:19:03.990,"But if you compress it,"
00:19:03.990,00:19:07.200,"the atoms get closer together and the chance of a stay"
00:19:07.200,00:19:09.840,"neutron hitting the nucleus increases."
00:19:09.840,00:19:13.662,"So the higher the density, the lower the critical mass."
00:19:13.662,00:19:16.800,"So if you set off conventional explosives"
00:19:16.800,00:19:18.810,"around a ball of plutonium,"
00:19:18.810,00:19:20.340,"you can get it compressed enough"
00:19:20.340,00:19:22.763,"to start a nuclear chain reaction."
00:19:22.763,00:19:25.047,"And this was the whole idea behind"
00:19:25.047,00:19:27.153,"the implosion bomb design."
00:19:29.730,00:19:33.180,"There are a couple ways to cheat lowering the critical mass."
00:19:33.180,00:19:34.050,"For one thing,"
00:19:34.050,00:19:36.390,"you surround the sphere with a material that reflects"
00:19:36.390,00:19:38.850,"neutrons decreasing the amount of nuclear fuel"
00:19:38.850,00:19:41.040,"you need to start a chain reaction."
00:19:41.040,00:19:43.260,"You can also have a neutron source,"
00:19:43.260,00:19:45.601,"something that kick starts the chain reaction."
00:19:45.601,00:19:48.240,"For the first implosion bomb,"
00:19:48.240,00:19:50.970,"scientists created a device called the urchin,"
00:19:50.970,00:19:54.660,"which was a tiny pellet weighing just seven grams,"
00:19:54.660,00:19:57.240,"and it would sit at the heart of the bomb."
00:19:57.240,00:19:59.940,"It was made of beryllium and polonium"
00:19:59.940,00:20:02.850,"separated by a layer of nickel and gold."
00:20:02.850,00:20:05.760,"The idea was that when the explosives detonated,"
00:20:05.760,00:20:09.330,"the shockwave would mix the beryllium and polonium together,"
00:20:09.330,00:20:11.550,"and then the alpha particles from polonium"
00:20:11.550,00:20:15.330,"would cause the beryllium to release a flood of neutrons,"
00:20:15.330,00:20:18.123,"which would set off the nuclear chain reaction."
00:20:19.380,00:20:21.150,"At least that was the hope."
00:20:21.150,00:20:23.213,"An atomic bomb had never been made before."
00:20:23.213,00:20:26.460,"Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists at Los Alamos"
00:20:26.460,00:20:27.990,"needed to act quickly."
00:20:27.990,00:20:29.910,"It was already 1945,"
00:20:29.910,00:20:32.130,"and Truman wanted to test the weapon"
00:20:32.130,00:20:34.800,"before the start of the Potsdam conference."
00:20:34.800,00:20:36.510,"That's where Truman, Churchill,"
00:20:36.510,00:20:40.170,"and Stalin would come together to plan the post-war piece."
00:20:40.170,00:20:43.740,"The conference began on the 17th of July."
00:20:43.740,00:20:46.140,"The earliest date that everything could be ready"
00:20:46.140,00:20:49.200,"for the bomb was just one day earlier."
00:20:49.200,00:20:52.560,"So that is when the test was scheduled."
00:20:52.560,00:20:54.333,"It was Codenamed Trinity."
00:20:57.780,00:21:00.870,"The night before Oppenheimer was nervous."
00:21:00.870,00:21:03.630,"There were so many things that could go wrong."
00:21:03.630,00:21:06.210,"The last test firing of the explosives"
00:21:06.210,00:21:10.650,"without the actual plutonium core was a failure."
00:21:10.650,00:21:11.850,"To calm himself,"
00:21:11.850,00:21:14.790,"he recited a stanza from the Bhagavad Gita,"
00:21:14.790,00:21:16.830,"the sacred Hindu poem."
00:21:16.830,00:21:19.440,"He had actually translated the Gita from the original"
00:21:19.440,00:21:21.338,"Sanskrit in himself."
00:21:21.338,00:21:23.670,"In battle, in forest,"
00:21:23.670,00:21:25.409,"at the precipice in the mountains,"
00:21:25.409,00:21:28.440,"on the dark great sea,"
00:21:28.440,00:21:29.940,"in the midst of javelins"
00:21:29.940,00:21:31.950,"and arrows in sleep,"
00:21:31.950,00:21:34.902,"in confusion, in the depths of shame,"
00:21:34.902,00:21:39.393,"the good deeds a man has done before defend him."
00:21:41.220,00:21:43.770,"Perhaps more terrifying than the idea of the bomb"
00:21:43.770,00:21:47.223,"not working was that it would work too well."
00:21:50.340,00:21:54.313,"Around 1942, Oppenheimer discussed with Arthur Compton"
00:21:54.313,00:21:58.230,"a terrible possibility that a nuclear test"
00:21:58.230,00:21:59.766,"could end the world."
00:21:59.766,00:22:02.010,"The worry was that the nuclear bomb"
00:22:02.010,00:22:06.423,"would create temperatures so hot that fusion would occur."
00:22:08.310,00:22:10.260,"A tiny fraction of the atmosphere,"
00:22:10.260,00:22:14.520,"just one part in 2 million is hydrogen gas."
00:22:14.520,00:22:16.650,"But the worry was that at high enough temperatures"
00:22:16.650,00:22:20.040,"and pressures that hydrogen could fuse to together"
00:22:20.040,00:22:21.660,"releasing energy,"
00:22:21.660,00:22:23.952,"this energy would fuse more hydrogen."
00:22:23.952,00:22:26.490,"It could also break apart the hydrogen"
00:22:26.490,00:22:30.120,"from water vapor causing that to fuse as well."
00:22:30.120,00:22:31.890,"That would release even more energy"
00:22:31.890,00:22:35.250,"causing yet more fusion until the entirety"
00:22:35.250,00:22:40.140,"of the Earth's atmosphere would become a giant fusion bomb."
00:22:40.140,00:22:43.680,"Recalling his conversations with Oppenheimer in 1959,"
00:22:43.680,00:22:47.146,"Compton said, ""Nor was this all that Oppenheimer feared."
00:22:47.146,00:22:50.520,"The nitrogen in the air is also unstable,"
00:22:50.520,00:22:51.975,"though in less degree."
00:22:51.975,00:22:54.930,"Might not it, too, be set off by an"
00:22:54.930,00:22:57.690,"atomic explosion in the atmosphere."""
00:22:57.690,00:22:59.640,"Most of the scientists quickly realized"
00:22:59.640,00:23:01.530,"how unlikely this scenario was,"
00:23:01.530,00:23:03.630,"and they continued on with the project,"
00:23:03.630,00:23:06.390,"so no one took the idea too seriously."
00:23:06.390,00:23:09.810,"But the thought of starting a fusion reaction with a fission"
00:23:09.810,00:23:13.391,"weapon would become very important after the war."
00:23:13.391,00:23:16.141,"(dramatic music)"
00:23:17.130,00:23:20.108,"The Trinity test was scheduled for 4:00 AM"
00:23:20.108,00:23:23.070,"but it was delayed due to a storm."
00:23:23.070,00:23:27.060,"So at 5:29 and 21 seconds, the gadget,"
00:23:27.060,00:23:30.630,"the world's first nuclear bomb detonated,"
00:23:30.630,00:23:34.504,"the high explosive squeezed the core of plutonium inwards."

00:23:40.080,00:23:41.760,"The urchin worked."
00:23:41.760,00:23:44.100,"It jump started the nuclear reaction,"
00:23:44.100,00:23:46.563,"and now there was no way to stop it."
00:23:47.580,00:23:51.090,"Just six kilograms of plutonium created an explosion"
00:23:51.090,00:23:55.860,"that was equivalent to nearly 25,000 tons of TNT."
00:23:55.860,00:23:57.750,"The New Mexico mountains were illuminated"
00:23:57.750,00:23:59.373,"brighter than in daytime."
00:23:59.373,00:24:04.373,"The shockwave was felt from over 160 kilometers away."
00:24:04.830,00:24:09.270,"The mushroom cloud rose to 12 kilometers into the sky."
00:24:09.270,00:24:12.360,"It was so hot that the desert sand melted"
00:24:12.360,00:24:15.867,"into a glassy mineral, now known as trinitite."
00:24:15.867,00:24:20.013,"Fortunately, the blast did not set fire to the atmosphere."
00:24:24.210,00:24:25.890,"On August 6th, 1945,"

00:29:22.770,00:29:25.540,"He especially despised the final scene where the character"
00:29:25.540,00:29:29.340,"of Oppenheimer realizes the evil of his work."
00:29:29.340,00:29:30.487,"And I quote,"
00:29:30.487,00:29:33.570,"""We have been doing the work of the devil."""
00:29:33.570,00:29:37.320,"To Oppenheimer, it was always more complicated than that."
00:29:37.320,00:29:40.260,"- I think that it probably was assumed,"
00:29:40.260,00:29:42.919,"it certainly was always assumed at Los Alamos"
00:29:42.919,00:29:47.919,"that if the war were not over and not clearly"
00:29:52.470,00:29:57.470,"to be brought to a conclusion by the diplomatic means"
00:29:58.940,00:30:01.230,"this weapon would play a part."
00:30:01.230,00:30:04.503,"At the time, the alternative,"
00:30:06.300,00:30:10.230,"the campaign of invasion was certainly much more terrible"
00:30:10.230,00:30:11.763,"for everyone concerned."
00:30:13.440,00:30:18.440,"I think that Hiroshima was far more costly in life"
00:30:21.180,00:30:26.180,"and suffering inhumane than it needed to have been,"
00:30:27.210,00:30:32.210,"to have been an effective argument for ending the war."
00:30:33.510,00:30:36.540,"This is easy to say after the fact."
00:30:36.540,00:30:39.870,"- In 1965, he was asked about the recent proposal of talks"
00:30:39.870,00:30:42.450,"with the Soviet Union to halt the proliferation"
00:30:42.450,00:30:43.380,"of nuclear weapons,"
00:30:43.380,00:30:44.857,"and his response was,"
00:30:44.857,00:30:48.180,"""It should have been done the day after Trinity."
00:30:48.180,00:30:51.570,"Later that same year, he was diagnosed with throat cancer."
00:30:51.570,00:30:53.295,"He was a lifelong smoker,"
00:30:53.295,00:30:58.295,"and he died on the 18th of February, 1967 aged 62."
00:31:05.190,00:31:07.951,"Advances in science and technology have given humans"
00:31:07.951,00:31:12.240,"tremendous power to make the world better or worse,"
00:31:12.240,00:31:15.480,"and nuclear war isn't the only thing we have to worry about."
00:31:15.480,00:31:18.630,"Human caused climate change poses a serious threat to"
00:31:18.630,00:31:22.380,"ecosystems and the most vulnerable people around the world."
00:31:22.380,00:31:25.290,"As I record this, we are in the midst of a heat wave,"
00:31:25.290,00:31:27.120,"and my folks up in Canada are suffering"
00:31:27.120,00:31:29.070,"in the smoke from wildfires."
00:31:29.070,00:31:31.723,"This is where this video sponsor Wren comes in."
00:31:31.723,00:31:34.712,"Their mission is to take action on climate change."
00:31:34.712,00:31:37.590,"On their website, you can calculate your carbon footprint,"
00:31:37.590,00:31:40.530,"which can help you identify ways to reduce your impact."
00:31:40.530,00:31:41.640,"And if you like,"
00:31:41.640,00:31:43.590,"you can offset your carbon footprint"
00:31:43.590,00:31:45.780,"with a simple monthly subscription."
00:31:45.780,00:31:47.880,"While individual action is important,"
00:31:47.880,00:31:51.000,"Wren understands that this alone is not enough,"
00:31:51.000,00:31:52.560,"which is why your subscription funds"
00:31:52.560,00:31:54.870,"not only carbon removal and offsets,"
00:31:54.870,00:31:57.660,"but also lobbying to enact climate policy"
00:31:57.660,00:31:59.970,"and land conservation projects."
00:31:59.970,00:32:01.230,"I am particularly fond"
00:32:01.230,00:32:04.110,"of their new refrigerant destruction project."
00:32:04.110,00:32:06.840,"We actually made a video about Thomas Midgley"
00:32:06.840,00:32:08.460,"who invented Freon,"
00:32:08.460,00:32:10.770,"which is a refrigerant that is both destructive"
00:32:10.770,00:32:14.730,"to the ozone layer and a very potent greenhouse gas."
00:32:14.730,00:32:16.680,"Well this project permanently destroys"
00:32:16.680,00:32:19.407,"harmful refrigerants like CFCs, HCFCs,"
00:32:19.407,00:32:22.860,"and HFCs to stop them from getting into the atmosphere."
00:32:22.860,00:32:25.442,"And this will reduce global warming and prevent the further"
00:32:25.442,00:32:27.210,"destruction of the ozone layer."
00:32:27.210,00:32:28.043,"It's a win-win."
00:32:28.043,00:32:30.600,"I personally offset my emissions with Wren,"
00:32:30.600,00:32:32.220,"and for the first a hundred people to sign up"
00:32:32.220,00:32:33.394,"using the link in the description,"
00:32:33.394,00:32:35.790,"I will personally pay for the first month"
00:32:35.790,00:32:36.840,"of your subscription."
00:32:36.840,00:32:39.030,"This is an idea I came up with myself"
00:32:39.030,00:32:41.430,"because I think it's so important that for those of us"
00:32:41.430,00:32:42.270,"who can help,"
00:32:42.270,00:32:43.740,"that we pool our resources together"
00:32:43.740,00:32:45.180,"to have a greater impact."
00:32:45.180,00:32:47.460,"So I hope you take the time to check out Wren."
00:32:47.460,00:32:49.740,"I wanna thank them for sponsoring this part of the video,"
00:32:49.740,00:32:51.603,"and I wanna thank you for watching."
