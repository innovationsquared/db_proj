00:00:00.100,00:00:03.930,"I am going to turn myself into an optical illusion"
00:00:03.930,00:00:06.140,"by going through this window right here."
00:00:06.140,00:00:09.440,"Ah, (grumbles) huh."
00:00:09.440,00:00:12.303,"Okay, I'm good, oh, not good."
00:00:13.890,00:00:15.800,"I was gonna say I'm good, I'm not good."
00:00:15.800,00:00:18.330,"Okay, so you're looking at this window"
00:00:18.330,00:00:20.060,"and it looks like it's turning around,"
00:00:20.060,00:00:22.260,"except here it stops."
00:00:22.260,00:00:24.780,"Now I keep rotating, but the window is rotating through me."
00:00:24.780,00:00:25.910,"What is happening?"
00:00:25.910,00:00:29.450,"This video is sponsored by NordVPN."
00:00:29.450,00:00:31.220,"They help you create the illusion"
00:00:31.220,00:00:33.273,"that you could be anywhere in the world."
00:00:34.600,00:00:36.370,"Let me backup for a second."
00:00:36.370,00:00:40.230,"This is the first part of a three part illusion."
00:00:40.230,00:00:42.500,"What do you see?"
00:00:42.500,00:00:43.880,"Well, there's a window"
00:00:43.880,00:00:48.880,"and it's turning, except it stops and reverses direction."
00:00:50.630,00:00:54.870,"So the window is oscillating back and forth."
00:00:54.870,00:00:57.510,"That's what most people see when they look at this illusion"
00:00:57.510,00:01:00.170,"except that's not what the window's actually doing."
00:01:00.170,00:01:04.800,"It's on this turntable and it is rotating continuously."
00:01:04.800,00:01:07.370,"This is known as the Ames window illusion."
00:01:07.370,00:01:10.100,"And I saw it on an old Australian TV program"
00:01:10.100,00:01:11.800,"called the Curiosity Show."
00:01:11.800,00:01:14.060,"And I was curious."
00:01:14.060,00:01:16.790,"So in this video, I'm gonna dig deeper into this illusion"
00:01:16.790,00:01:19.180,"than anyone has before."
00:01:19.180,00:01:21.800,"You know the window itself is not a rectangle,"
00:01:21.800,00:01:23.250,"but a trapezoid."
00:01:23.250,00:01:26.710,"You can see this side here is much shorter"
00:01:26.710,00:01:29.790,"than this side over here."
00:01:29.790,00:01:32.110,"And that is essential to the illusion."
00:01:32.110,00:01:35.560,"Also essential, it is shaded to make it look 3-D,"
00:01:35.560,00:01:37.940,"but it's actually just a two dimensional card"
00:01:37.940,00:01:40.670,"with the same image on both sides."
00:01:40.670,00:01:43.020,"So now that you know exactly what this object looks like"
00:01:43.020,00:01:46.060,"and what it's doing, can you correctly perceive"
00:01:46.060,00:01:49.600,"the rotation rather than the oscillation?"
00:01:49.600,00:01:51.040,"I still can't."
00:01:51.040,00:01:53.240,"It still looks to my brain"
00:01:53.240,00:01:56.763,"like this window is going back and forth."
00:01:58.270,00:01:59.690,"Okay, here's an idea."
00:01:59.690,00:02:02.560,"I'm going to attach this Rubik's Cube"
00:02:02.560,00:02:05.900,"to the short side of the trapezoid"
00:02:05.900,00:02:09.590,"so we can keep track of it as it goes around."
00:02:09.590,00:02:10.433,"Are you ready?"
00:02:11.330,00:02:12.889,"Okay."
00:02:12.889,00:02:15.400,"(dramatic music)"
00:02:15.400,00:02:18.820,"Okay, the Rubik's Cube is going around."
00:02:18.820,00:02:20.793,"Everything seems normal."
00:02:22.930,00:02:26.410,"But now what is that?"
00:02:26.410,00:02:31.410,"It looks like the Rubik's Cube is continuing to go around,"
00:02:31.600,00:02:34.073,"but the window is oscillating back and forth."
00:02:35.430,00:02:37.480,"There it goes, the Rubik's Cube around the back."
00:02:37.480,00:02:39.290,"I don't even know what's happening."
00:02:39.290,00:02:42.040,"(dramatic music)"
00:02:43.263,00:02:44.880,"Whoa, look at that."
00:02:44.880,00:02:47.700,"It looks like the Rubik's Cube is out drifting by itself"
00:02:47.700,00:02:50.400,"out in front of the whole illusion."
00:02:50.400,00:02:51.483,"What is happening?"
00:02:53.130,00:02:56.810,"Okay new plan, I'm going to take off the Rubik's Cube"
00:02:56.810,00:02:58.750,"and I'm gonna put a ruler"
00:02:58.750,00:03:02.050,"right through the middle of the window."
00:03:02.050,00:03:06.690,"And so we can't possibly be fooled by the illusion, right?"
00:03:06.690,00:03:07.713,"Okay, here we go."
00:03:10.400,00:03:14.400,"Okay, the ruler is rotating around,"
00:03:14.400,00:03:17.960,"but wait now the window is going backwards whoa, whoa!"
00:03:17.960,00:03:21.310,"The ruler is going through the window."
00:03:21.310,00:03:25.450,"It is doing things which I know are physically impossible"
00:03:25.450,00:03:29.080,"but that is how my brain is seeing it."
00:03:29.080,00:03:30.134,"Look, here we go again."
00:03:30.134,00:03:33.410,"The ruler is turning around with the window"
00:03:33.410,00:03:37.210,"but right about here the windows starts going backwards"
00:03:37.210,00:03:39.640,"but the ruler keeps coming."
00:03:39.640,00:03:43.270,"What is even like, how is this possible?"
00:03:43.270,00:03:46.010,"This doesn't make any sense."
00:03:46.010,00:03:48.340,"But that is the way my brain interprets this."
00:03:48.340,00:03:50.500,"It clearly prefers the illusion"
00:03:50.500,00:03:52.200,"over seeing what's really happening,"
00:03:52.200,00:03:54.600,"the continuous rotation."
00:03:54.600,00:03:58.340,"So why is this, how does the illusion work?"
00:03:58.340,00:04:02.680,"Well, it was created by Adelbert Ames back in 1947."
00:04:02.680,00:04:04.670,"And before becoming a researcher,"
00:04:04.670,00:04:06.810,"he wanted to be a visual artist."
00:04:06.810,00:04:08.040,"So he was fascinated"
00:04:08.040,00:04:11.580,"by how people perceive shapes and shading."
00:04:11.580,00:04:14.370,"And according to him, the key to this illusion"
00:04:14.370,00:04:15.750,"is that we're all used to living"
00:04:15.750,00:04:18.670,"in rectangular boxes, essentially."
00:04:18.670,00:04:21.030,"You know houses and rooms"
00:04:21.030,00:04:23.320,"where virtually all of the corners we see"
00:04:23.320,00:04:25.570,"are 90 degree angles."
00:04:25.570,00:04:27.830,"Doors, windows, tables and chairs"
00:04:27.830,00:04:30.590,"are full of 90 degree angles."
00:04:30.590,00:04:34.060,"This is called the carpentered environment."
00:04:34.060,00:04:36.640,"But unless we're looking straight on at something,"
00:04:36.640,00:04:40.310,"the angles we actually see are not 90 degrees."
00:04:40.310,00:04:42.550,"I mean, the images that form on our retinas"
00:04:42.550,00:04:46.200,"are typically trapezoids of different shapes and sizes."
00:04:46.200,00:04:47.760,"Now from extensive experience,"
00:04:47.760,00:04:50.760,"our brains know they really should be rectangles"
00:04:50.760,00:04:52.010,"and right angles."
00:04:52.010,00:04:54.320,"So our brains use these strange shapes"
00:04:54.320,00:04:56.300,"to infer depth information,"
00:04:56.300,00:05:00.070,"which in our rectilinear world is almost always correct."
00:05:00.070,00:05:02.960,"But not in the case of a trapezoidal window"
00:05:02.960,00:05:05.200,"that our brains assume to be rectangular,"
00:05:05.200,00:05:07.120,"hence the illusion."
00:05:07.120,00:05:10.400,"Now, if this carpentered world hypothesis is correct,"
00:05:10.400,00:05:12.840,"well then you'd expect people with less experience"
00:05:12.840,00:05:14.500,"of rectangles in their environments"
00:05:14.500,00:05:16.997,"to be less susceptible to the illusion."
00:05:16.997,00:05:21.850,"And to test exactly this, in 1957 Harvard psychologists"
00:05:21.850,00:05:24.590,"tried the Ames window illusion in South Africa"
00:05:24.590,00:05:27.630,"with 80 children, aged 10 to 14."
00:05:27.630,00:05:29.890,"40 of them were living in the city of Durban"
00:05:29.890,00:05:33.300,"full of rectangular buildings, doors and windows."
00:05:33.300,00:05:36.780,"The other 40 were from nearby rural communities"
00:05:36.780,00:05:38.520,"where they lived in round huts"
00:05:38.520,00:05:41.930,"with few prominent 90 degree angles."
00:05:41.930,00:05:43.700,"When subjects were seated 10 feet away"
00:05:43.700,00:05:46.750,"from the rotating Ames window with both eyes open,"
00:05:46.750,00:05:48.590,"60% of the urban group"
00:05:48.590,00:05:51.320,"reported seeing the window oscillating."
00:05:51.320,00:05:56.320,"But in the rural group, only 17.5% saw the same thing."
00:05:56.750,00:05:58.580,"So the results were consistent"
00:05:58.580,00:06:00.410,"with the carpentered world hypothesis."
00:06:00.410,00:06:02.810,"The kids with less experience of rectangles"
00:06:02.810,00:06:05.270,"were less likely to fall for the illusion."
00:06:05.270,00:06:07.480,"But that's not the whole story."
00:06:07.480,00:06:10.540,"When seated 20 feet away and with one eye closed,"
00:06:10.540,00:06:12.950,"the illusion was much more convincing."
00:06:12.950,00:06:16.600,"Now, 90% of all participants saw the window oscillating"
00:06:16.600,00:06:18.160,"and there was no significant difference"
00:06:18.160,00:06:20.760,"between urban and rural groups."
00:06:20.760,00:06:24.580,"That means something else must be going on over and above"
00:06:24.580,00:06:26.510,"our experience with rectangles."
00:06:26.510,00:06:28.680,"In fact, you can get a similar illusion"
00:06:28.680,00:06:31.260,"without any straight lines at all."
00:06:31.260,00:06:33.320,"This is the de Heer circle,"
00:06:33.320,00:06:35.200,"when rotating continuously,"
00:06:35.200,00:06:37.840,"it also appears to oscillate back and forth."
00:06:37.840,00:06:39.810,"So what's going on?"
00:06:39.810,00:06:41.320,"Well, both of these illusions"
00:06:41.320,00:06:43.590,"make use of a technique called anamorphosis"
00:06:43.590,00:06:45.380,"which has been used by artists"
00:06:45.380,00:06:47.703,"for centuries if not millennia."
00:06:48.690,00:06:52.170,"This is a painting from 1533"
00:06:52.170,00:06:56.270,"called The Ambassadors by Hans Holbein the Younger."
00:06:56.270,00:06:58.700,"It clearly shows two prominent figures,"
00:06:58.700,00:07:02.710,"but there's also this distorted shape over the floor."
00:07:02.710,00:07:05.020,"Only when viewed from the correct position"
00:07:05.020,00:07:07.230,"either of the top right or bottom left,"
00:07:07.230,00:07:09.740,"does it become clear that the image is actually"
00:07:09.740,00:07:12.710,"a detailed depiction of a human skull."
00:07:12.710,00:07:14.010,"It's suspected that the painting"
00:07:14.010,00:07:15.630,"was meant to be hung in a stairwell"
00:07:15.630,00:07:17.830,"where presumably out of the corner of your eye,"
00:07:17.830,00:07:20.960,"you would spot the striking image of the skull"
00:07:20.960,00:07:23.690,"reminding you of your own mortality."
00:07:23.690,00:07:26.050,"But if you were to look at the painting head-on"
00:07:26.050,00:07:29.240,"well, the skull would be pretty hard to see."
00:07:29.240,00:07:32.000,"Anamorphosis involves making a distorted projection"
00:07:32.000,00:07:32.960,"of an object."
00:07:32.960,00:07:34.650,"So to see its proper proportions,"
00:07:34.650,00:07:37.570,"you need to look at the work from a particular position"
00:07:37.570,00:07:40.760,"or with a particular device, often a mirror."
00:07:40.760,00:07:42.370,"There are earlier examples"
00:07:42.370,00:07:45.210,"like Leonardo's Eye by Leonardo da Vinci,"
00:07:45.210,00:07:48.970,"which only takes its proper form when viewed from the side."
00:07:48.970,00:07:52.470,"Clearly, Leonardo knew how to give side-eye."
00:07:52.470,00:07:54.650,"And some might argue that the cave paintings"
00:07:54.650,00:07:57.780,"at Lascaux France from 17,000 years ago"
00:07:57.780,00:08:00.680,"provide the first examples of anamorphic art."
00:08:00.680,00:08:03.160,"Due to the uneven painting surface,"
00:08:03.160,00:08:04.540,"artists would have had to consider"
00:08:04.540,00:08:06.760,"how their animal figures would be perceived"
00:08:06.760,00:08:08.783,"from different vantage points."
00:08:10.197,00:08:12.947,"(dramatic music)"
00:08:15.130,00:08:16.640,"Anamorphosis is also central"
00:08:16.640,00:08:21.030,"to perhaps Ames most famous illusion, The Ames Room."
00:08:21.030,00:08:25.140,"Ames designed his first distortive room in 1934."
00:08:25.140,00:08:28.610,"And with one eye, from one privilege perspective"
00:08:28.610,00:08:31.050,"it just looks like an ordinary room."
00:08:31.050,00:08:34.450,"But when people move around the room,"
00:08:34.450,00:08:38.373,"it becomes obvious that something is not quite right."
00:08:40.740,00:08:42.250,"An Ames Room is constructed"
00:08:42.250,00:08:44.490,"by taking an ordinary rectangular room"
00:08:44.490,00:08:47.350,"and adding a diagonal wall through the middle of it."
00:08:47.350,00:08:50.690,"Then draw lines connecting all the key parts of the room"
00:08:50.690,00:08:53.000,"like corners, windows, and so on"
00:08:53.000,00:08:55.180,"to the privileged viewpoint."
00:08:55.180,00:08:58.970,"Mark where those lines intersect the diagonal wall."
00:08:58.970,00:09:01.530,"Then add a floor and a ceiling."
00:09:01.530,00:09:03.490,"If the projection is done properly,"
00:09:03.490,00:09:07.130,"they will not only be tilted but also warped."
00:09:07.130,00:09:08.630,"Then connect the floor and ceiling"
00:09:08.630,00:09:13.254,"with trapezoidal walls and voila, you have an Ames Room."
00:09:13.254,00:09:15.837,"(gentle music)"
00:09:20.680,00:09:23.550,"Ames realized there are an infinite number"
00:09:23.550,00:09:26.260,"of different distorted room geometries"
00:09:26.260,00:09:28.800,"which when viewed from the privileged position"
00:09:28.800,00:09:33.230,"create virtually identical images of a normal room."
00:09:33.230,00:09:36.510,"So our perceptions far from transparently"
00:09:36.510,00:09:38.560,"representing external reality"
00:09:38.560,00:09:41.160,"are constantly faced with ambiguity."
00:09:41.160,00:09:43.900,"And our brains below the level of consciousness"
00:09:43.900,00:09:47.170,"have to decide which of the infinite possibilities"
00:09:47.170,00:09:48.693,"we're actually looking at."
00:09:50.600,00:09:53.890,"One form of ambiguity relates to depth perception."
00:09:53.890,00:09:57.160,"Which of these masks protrudes outwards towards the camera,"
00:09:57.160,00:09:59.330,"and which is an impression?"
00:09:59.330,00:10:03.430,"Only through motion does it become obvious, which is which."
00:10:03.430,00:10:06.100,"We are subconsciously attuned to visual cues"
00:10:06.100,00:10:09.160,"that indicate how close or far away something is."
00:10:09.160,00:10:11.930,"Closer objects are typically bigger and brighter,"
00:10:11.930,00:10:14.560,"plus they obscure objects behind them."
00:10:14.560,00:10:17.070,"But we can play with these attributes"
00:10:17.070,00:10:20.693,"in order to create situations that defy our expectations."
00:10:23.010,00:10:24.970,"Now I have been obsessed"
00:10:24.970,00:10:28.520,"with getting the Ames window illusion to work."
00:10:28.520,00:10:33.050,"Look at how many different Ames windows I have been making."
00:10:33.050,00:10:37.403,"And I made them small initially, and then bigger."
00:10:39.540,00:10:42.720,"There used to be a disco ball in this room,"
00:10:42.720,00:10:45.020,"I never thought that this would come in handy."
00:10:45.910,00:10:47.430,"Then I thought about the question,"
00:10:47.430,00:10:50.260,"how could I make myself like the ruler"
00:10:50.260,00:10:52.660,"that passes through the Ames window?"
00:10:52.660,00:10:56.863,"And of course, then I would need a very large Ames window."
00:10:57.910,00:11:00.300,"So it's been this holiday season,"
00:11:00.300,00:11:02.170,"like we're living in a weird,"
00:11:02.170,00:11:04.730,"surreal art museum or something."
00:11:04.730,00:11:07.130,"It needed to be at least eight feet"
00:11:07.130,00:11:08.393,"on its longest dimension."
00:11:09.400,00:11:11.960,"It's actually made out of six pieces of plywood,"
00:11:11.960,00:11:13.561,"glued, screwed together."
00:11:13.561,00:11:14.820,"(saw cutting)"
00:11:14.820,00:11:17.580,"One of the challenges is to make it really thin"
00:11:17.580,00:11:20.540,"because ideally it should just be two dimensional."
00:11:20.540,00:11:22.823,"So we had to bevel these edges here."
00:11:22.823,00:11:25.406,"(gentle music)"
00:11:27.590,00:11:30.530,"So then I would twist up these metal cables"
00:11:30.530,00:11:32.350,"that hang it to the ceiling"
00:11:32.350,00:11:35.030,"and then jump in the window and let them unwind."
00:11:35.030,00:11:38.870,"Ah,(grumbles) huh, okay."
00:11:38.870,00:11:41.100,"So I'll show you some of the best shots I was able to get"
00:11:41.100,00:11:43.610,"and you let me know, does this work for you?"
00:11:43.610,00:11:44.760,"Do you see it oscillating"
00:11:44.760,00:11:47.703,"or do you just see it rotating as it actually is?"
00:11:49.350,00:11:51.600,"I found lighting is really important."
00:11:51.600,00:11:53.930,"The lighting needs to be really even on both sides"
00:11:53.930,00:11:57.423,"to convince you that it is really oscillating."
00:11:59.490,00:12:02.430,"When the large side of the trapezoid is close to us,"
00:12:02.430,00:12:05.700,"we perceive it rotating exactly as it is."
00:12:05.700,00:12:07.920,"But when the large side moves around to the back,"
00:12:07.920,00:12:11.450,"it is still larger in our field of view than the small side."
00:12:11.450,00:12:13.740,"So our brain perceives it as closer"
00:12:13.740,00:12:16.330,"and rotating in the opposite direction."
00:12:16.330,00:12:18.910,"This is why the window appears to oscillate."
00:12:18.910,00:12:21.340,"Half the time we're seeing the window as it is,"
00:12:21.340,00:12:23.150,"and half the time we're seeing the bigger side"
00:12:23.150,00:12:26.343,"as closer to us, even though it's farther away."
00:12:28.610,00:12:30.610,"But how do we develop the ability"
00:12:30.610,00:12:33.540,"to interpret depth cues in the first place?"
00:12:33.540,00:12:36.210,"Well, it seems to be an innate ability"
00:12:36.210,00:12:39.710,"which forms very early in our development."
00:12:39.710,00:12:42.920,"They've actually shown babies in three different age groups"
00:12:42.920,00:12:44.910,"five and a half months, seven and a half months"
00:12:44.910,00:12:48.600,"and nine months the Ames window illusion."
00:12:48.600,00:12:50.930,"Do they see the window oscillating?"
00:12:50.930,00:12:54.130,"And how would we know if they did?"
00:12:54.130,00:12:57.000,"Well, babies have a well-known preference for novelty."
00:12:57.000,00:12:59.260,"They look longer at things that are new to them."
00:12:59.260,00:13:01.540,"So experimenters first exposed them"
00:13:01.540,00:13:03.740,"to an ordinary rotating circle."
00:13:03.740,00:13:05.820,"And then they showed them simultaneously"
00:13:05.820,00:13:09.610,"the Ames window and a rotating rectangular window."
00:13:09.610,00:13:11.580,"The five and a half month old babies"
00:13:11.580,00:13:14.620,"showed no special preference for the Ames window."
00:13:14.620,00:13:16.860,"But the seven and a half and nine month olds"
00:13:16.860,00:13:19.930,"were significantly more interested in the Ames window."
00:13:19.930,00:13:21.640,"Suggesting they perceive it"
00:13:21.640,00:13:24.893,"as doing something different, presumably oscillating."
00:13:27.100,00:13:30.710,"The reason I have been so obsessed with this illusion"
00:13:30.710,00:13:32.100,"is because I think it confronts"
00:13:32.100,00:13:34.500,"one of the big misconceptions about science."
00:13:34.500,00:13:37.110,"Which is this idea that scientists propose"
00:13:37.110,00:13:39.500,"competing theories, and then all you have to do"
00:13:39.500,00:13:44.350,"is look at the data to decide which is the best theory."
00:13:44.350,00:13:46.670,"The truth is there are many circumstances"
00:13:46.670,00:13:47.980,"in which the same data"
00:13:47.980,00:13:51.340,"could come from very different external realities."
00:13:51.340,00:13:52.950,"To use a classic example,"
00:13:52.950,00:13:55.060,"does the sun go around the earth"
00:13:55.060,00:13:58.280,"or does the earth rotate on its axis?"
00:13:58.280,00:14:01.360,"The observation of the sun moving across the sky"
00:14:01.360,00:14:05.010,"doesn't in itself resolve that debate."
00:14:05.010,00:14:07.040,"Or to use more modern examples,"
00:14:07.040,00:14:08.470,"when you make a quantum measurement"
00:14:08.470,00:14:10.500,"does the wave function collapse"
00:14:10.500,00:14:12.713,"or does it branch the universe?"
00:14:14.790,00:14:18.120,"Is the speed of light really the same in all directions"
00:14:18.120,00:14:23.120,"or does it differ and only the roundtrip speed is seen?"
00:14:23.200,00:14:25.810,"As of right now the data do not discriminate"
00:14:25.810,00:14:27.770,"between those theories."
00:14:27.770,00:14:30.700,"And I think we can extend this beyond science."
00:14:30.700,00:14:32.670,"I mean maybe the Ames illusions"
00:14:32.670,00:14:35.420,"are a good metaphor for life."
00:14:35.420,00:14:38.810,"We feel as though we can directly perceive external reality"
00:14:38.810,00:14:41.500,"like a person looking into an Ames Room,"
00:14:41.500,00:14:43.910,"but the truth is there are an infinite number"
00:14:43.910,00:14:48.320,"of different geometries that would all look the same."
00:14:48.320,00:14:49.780,"You know these days, a lot of people"
00:14:49.780,00:14:52.810,"are getting the same fundamental information"
00:14:52.810,00:14:55.140,"but coming to very different conclusions"
00:14:55.140,00:14:57.600,"about the state of reality."
00:14:57.600,00:14:58.990,"So I think in that context,"
00:14:58.990,00:15:01.690,"it's important to remember that something as simple"
00:15:01.690,00:15:04.080,"as a little rotating picture"
00:15:04.080,00:15:07.623,"can fool our brains in fairly spectacular ways."
00:15:08.490,00:15:11.660,"So we should approach the world and our conclusions about it"
00:15:11.660,00:15:16.330,"with a little more humility and a little less certainty."
00:15:16.330,00:15:19.080,"(dramatic music)"
00:15:21.360,00:15:24.600,"Hey, this video was sponsored by NordVPN."
00:15:24.600,00:15:26.460,"Get a special deal for the holidays"
00:15:26.460,00:15:29.860,"when you go to NordVPN.com/veritasium."
00:15:29.860,00:15:30.970,"Now earlier this year,"
00:15:30.970,00:15:33.830,"I wanted to watch my favorite sports team in the playoffs."
00:15:33.830,00:15:36.980,"So I bought an all access pass from the league."
00:15:36.980,00:15:38.780,"But then when I went to watch a game,"
00:15:38.780,00:15:41.340,"there was a blackout restriction in my area."
00:15:41.340,00:15:45.360,"So I used NordVPN to set my location to Australia"
00:15:45.360,00:15:47.970,"and watch the game from there."
00:15:47.970,00:15:49.750,"In the past, I've made documentaries"
00:15:49.750,00:15:52.150,"that were free to stream in the U.S. or Australia"
00:15:52.150,00:15:55.970,"but basically impossible to access almost anywhere else."
00:15:55.970,00:15:57.930,"And VPNs offer the solution."
00:15:57.930,00:16:00.430,"They help you create the illusion"
00:16:00.430,00:16:01.880,"that you were somewhere else."
00:16:01.880,00:16:05.570,"And with NordVPN, you get access to 5,000 servers"
00:16:05.570,00:16:07.430,"in nearly 60 countries."
00:16:07.430,00:16:10.520,"Plus using a VPN prevents your internet service provider"
00:16:10.520,00:16:12.400,"from seeing the sites you visit."
00:16:12.400,00:16:14.570,"And this is something I take particular advantage of"
00:16:14.570,00:16:18.290,"when joining public Wi-Fis at cafes or when I'm traveling."
00:16:18.290,00:16:21.030,"In a time when everyone wants to capture"
00:16:21.030,00:16:22.630,"as much of your data as possible,"
00:16:22.630,00:16:24.420,"I think it's important to push back"
00:16:24.420,00:16:27.280,"and minimize the amount of info you're putting out there."
00:16:27.280,00:16:29.430,"And best of all, in this special holiday deal"
00:16:29.430,00:16:33.050,"NordVPN is offering 68% off a two-year plan"
00:16:33.050,00:16:34.470,"plus four months free."
00:16:34.470,00:16:37.530,"Just go to NordVPN.com/veritasium."
00:16:37.530,00:16:39.410,"I'll put that link down in the description"
00:16:39.410,00:16:41.530,"and use code Veritasium."
00:16:41.530,00:16:44.090,"So I wanna thank NordVPN for sponsoring this video,"
00:16:44.090,00:16:46.520,"and I wanna thank you for watching."
00:16:46.520,00:16:49.910,"I know you're thinking his channel is named for an element,"
00:16:49.910,00:16:53.230,"but he's wearing a different element on his shirt."
00:16:53.230,00:16:54.603,"Oh the irony."
