00:00:01.590,00:00:06.190,"I am here at the University of Sydney where the mechanical engineering shop has built"
00:00:06.190,00:00:08.570,"this incredible piece of apparatus for me."
00:00:08.570,00:00:14.160,"It is a forty pound, that is nineteen kilogram flywheel on the end of a meter long shaft."
00:00:14.160,00:00:19.720,"Can you imagine trying to hold this out horizontally with just one hand at this end?"
00:00:19.720,00:00:22.390,"It is virtually..."
00:00:22.390,00:00:23.390,"it is impossible, ok?"
00:00:23.390,00:00:25.380,"No I'm going to let go."
00:00:25.380,00:00:27.310,"You going to be able to hold this at all?"
00:00:27.310,00:00:28.740,"I hope so."
00:00:28.740,00:00:30.171,"Can you lift it out?"
00:00:30.171,00:00:31.590,"Make it horizontal - hold it, hold it, hold it."
00:00:31.590,00:00:32.590,"Come on."
00:00:32.590,00:00:33.880,"Just try to - I want you to hold it out horizontal."
00:00:33.880,00:00:34.880,"See if you can."
00:00:34.880,00:00:35.880,"Hold it, hold it!"
00:00:35.880,00:00:36.880,"Ahh, come on!"
00:00:36.880,00:00:37.880,"No."
00:00:37.880,00:00:43.230,"What I'm going to do is I am going to spin this up to a few thousand RPM and then I'm"
00:00:43.230,00:00:48.190,"going to attempt just that, to hold it from one end and have it out horizontally."
00:00:48.190,00:00:55.990,"Five, four, three, two, one."
00:00:55.990,00:00:57.550,"Boom."
00:00:57.550,00:01:03.550,"I'm going to let go with my left hand."
00:01:03.550,00:01:09.630,"What you'll see is that the shaft remains horizontal, see it going around there."
00:01:09.630,00:01:12.200,"It almost looks as though the wheel is weightless."
00:01:12.200,00:01:13.459,"How does this work?"
00:01:13.459,00:01:17.140,"Well instead of pulling the wheel down to the ground as you'd expect, the weight of"
00:01:17.140,00:01:20.659,"the wheel creates a torque which pushes it around in a circle."
00:01:20.659,00:01:23.479,"You may recognise this as gyroscopic precession."
00:01:23.479,00:01:27.049,"For a more detailed explanation, click the annotation, or the link in the description"
00:01:27.049,00:01:29.540,"to see my video on the topic."
00:01:29.540,00:01:32.049,"Here I want to try something more extreme."
00:01:32.049,00:01:37.549,"I'm going to try to lift it over my head with one hand while it's spinning."
00:01:37.549,00:01:38.549,"Wish me luck."
00:01:38.549,00:01:42.549,"But before I make the attempt, Rod wisely suggests that I first check if I can lift"
00:01:42.549,00:01:44.389,"the wheel above my head without it spinning."
00:01:44.389,00:01:48.400,"OK, let's prove that I could lift it, just this end, without it spinning."
00:01:48.400,00:01:49.829,"Here we go."
00:01:49.829,00:01:53.700,"agggh I mean it's just kind of awkward with the"
00:01:53.700,00:01:54.770,"hand."
00:01:54.770,00:01:55.850,"Careful!"
00:01:55.850,00:01:59.090,"Ah, che Careful!"
00:01:59.090,00:02:01.249,"Ha Oooohhh"
00:02:01.249,00:02:03.409,"Just barely."
00:02:03.409,00:02:07.859,"Oh goodness, do you even lift?"
00:02:07.859,00:02:08.859,"Clearly I do not."
00:02:08.859,00:02:13.450,"Undaunted by my lack of strength, I'm going for it, but I want to make sure the wheel"
00:02:13.450,00:02:17.590,"is spinning as fast as possible to give me the best chance of success."
00:02:17.590,00:02:20.219,"Give it ten more seconds."
00:02:20.219,00:02:25.489,"Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one."
00:02:25.489,00:02:26.489,"Pull!"
00:02:26.489,00:02:27.489,"Go."
00:02:27.489,00:02:28.489,"That was perfect."
00:02:28.489,00:02:34.100,"Now I'm going to release my left hand and holding only with my right hand at the end"
00:02:34.100,00:02:38.980,"of the shaft, I'll try to lift it up over my head."
00:02:38.980,00:02:42.469,"This is a forty pound, nineteen kilogram flywheel."
00:02:42.469,00:02:43.629,"Ready?"
00:02:43.629,00:02:50.580,"Here we go: three, two, one."
00:02:50.580,00:02:51.739,"Beautiful!"
00:02:51.739,00:02:59.840,"Let's go again in three, two, one."
00:02:59.840,00:03:01.000,"Nice!"
00:03:01.000,00:03:02.159,"Smooth."
00:03:02.159,00:03:05.640,"Three, two, one."
00:03:05.640,00:03:34.239,"It feels incredibly, incredibly light as I do that."
00:03:34.239,00:04:02.029,"When you said it felt incredibly light, yeah"
00:04:02.029,00:04:04.269,"you mean when you're lifting it feels light?"
00:04:04.269,00:04:05.269,"Yeah."
00:04:05.269,00:04:08.529,"It shouldn't!"
00:04:08.529,00:04:09.529,"I know."
00:04:09.529,00:04:11.510,"Hahahaha Honestly, I have lifted it up with one hand"
00:04:11.510,00:04:12.609,"when it's not spinning."
00:04:12.609,00:04:13.609,"Yeah."
00:04:13.609,00:04:16.049,"And it feels really hard to lift it up, like it's a big effort."
00:04:16.049,00:04:17.049,"Yeah."
00:04:17.049,00:04:20.930,"But with this, when it's spinning it honestly felt like it was just..."
00:04:20.930,00:04:22.580,"wanting to go up by itself."
00:04:22.580,00:04:23.580,"Yes."
00:04:23.580,00:04:27.680,"It felt like I was not struggling like I was not putting in the amount of force that you'd"
00:04:27.680,00:04:31.449,"think to lift that kind of weight."
00:04:31.449,00:04:34.350,"I bet if you let it go, it'd crash down to the ground."
00:04:34.350,00:04:35.389,"It's not weightless!"
00:04:35.389,00:04:36.520,"We can't do that though."
00:04:36.520,00:04:38.020,"We can't do that part of the experiment."
00:04:38.020,00:04:43.520,"What we could maybe do is I could stand on a scale and we could see what the weight of"
00:04:43.520,00:04:48.270,"me plus that apparatus does, while I'm lifting it up over my head, see if I get lighter in"
00:04:48.270,00:04:49.270,"essence."
00:04:49.270,00:04:52.500,"You can see that just my weight is about 72 kilograms."
00:04:52.500,00:04:59.970,"Now when I pick up the flywheel it goes up to about 91 kilograms, which makes sense because"
00:04:59.970,00:05:03.610,"the flywheel itself is about 19 kilos, that's about 42 pounds."
00:05:03.610,00:05:06.280,"Now we're going to spin it up and I want you to make a prediction."
00:05:06.280,00:05:11.229,"As I'm lifting it over my head, do you think the scale reading will be more, less than,"
00:05:11.229,00:05:13.420,"or equal to 91 kilograms."
00:05:13.420,00:05:16.370,"What do you think?"
00:05:16.370,00:05:20.180,"You can make your prediction by clicking on one of the on-screen annotations or if you're"
00:05:20.180,00:05:23.050,"on mobile you can click a link in the description."
00:05:23.050,00:05:30.039,"Five, four, three, two, one."
