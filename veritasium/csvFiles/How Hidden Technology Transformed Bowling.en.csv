00:00:00.090,00:00:03.710,"A portion of this video was sponsored by Salesforce."
00:00:03.710,00:00:08.250,"This is the biggest, most in-depth video about bowling ever."
00:00:08.250,00:00:10.690,"How bowling balls are made, the best way to throw them,"
00:00:10.690,00:00:13.400,"maximize strikes, how the lanes are oiled,"
00:00:13.400,00:00:15.190,"what it takes to be a pro"
00:00:15.190,00:00:17.970,"and how this sport has continually been reinvented"
00:00:17.970,00:00:22.008,"for literally thousands of years, up to the present day."
00:00:22.008,00:00:22.940,"(bowling strikes)"
00:00:22.940,00:00:24.560,"This is the science of bowling,"
00:00:24.560,00:00:29.560,"the most popular participatory sport in the United States."
00:00:29.630,00:00:31.300,"I'm super impressed with how that went."
00:00:31.300,00:00:34.160,"- I'm even more impressed than you are."
00:00:34.160,00:00:36.640,"- What is inside a bowling ball?"
00:00:36.640,00:00:38.430,"I sent this ball to Creative Electron"
00:00:38.430,00:00:41.050,"to get a 3D x-ray scan"
00:00:41.050,00:00:44.150,"and this is the result."
00:00:44.150,00:00:44.990,"What is that?"
00:00:44.990,00:00:47.170,"I always expected bowling balls to be, you know,"
00:00:47.170,00:00:51.120,"perfect solid spheres, but there's something inside here"
00:00:51.120,00:00:53.450,"and it's not symmetric"
00:00:53.450,00:00:56.290,"and it's not even centered in the ball."
00:00:56.290,00:00:57.950,"So I went to Storm Bowling,"
00:00:57.950,00:01:00.420,"one of only 11 bowling ball manufacturers in the world"
00:01:00.420,00:01:03.580,"to find out how bowling balls are made."
00:01:03.580,00:01:05.550,"- Yeah. Basically when we make bowling balls,"
00:01:05.550,00:01:07.040,"we always start in the center"
00:01:07.040,00:01:09.800,"and the center part of the bowling ball is the weight block."
00:01:09.800,00:01:11.370,"And as you can see this is an example"
00:01:11.370,00:01:13.360,"of an asymmetrical shaped weight block,"
00:01:13.360,00:01:15.040,"so it's actually a different shape"
00:01:15.040,00:01:18.138,"about the X, the Y and the Z axis."
00:01:18.138,00:01:20.721,"(serene music)"
00:01:23.000,00:01:24.470,"- The weight blocks are embedded"
00:01:24.470,00:01:26.993,"in a core of lightweight glass beads."
00:01:30.100,00:01:32.600,"- That is so silky-soft."
00:01:32.600,00:01:34.950,"I feel like I have not felt anything this soft."
00:01:35.920,00:01:37.990,"What's the difference in density between"
00:01:37.990,00:01:40.470,"this sort of filling material and this core?"
00:01:40.470,00:01:41.310,"- It's quite a bit."
00:01:41.310,00:01:43.910,"About two and a half to three times more dense"
00:01:43.910,00:01:45.430,"in the inner weight block"
00:01:45.430,00:01:47.203,"than it is in the core material."
00:01:51.280,00:01:54.440,"- If you were to look for example at this actual core."
00:01:54.440,00:01:56.130,"Number one, it says 9 6 0"
00:01:56.130,00:01:58.360,"which means that it weighs 9.60 pounds."
00:01:58.360,00:02:00.010,"And then the description here underneath,"
00:02:00.010,00:02:01.050,"which is a 0 3,"
00:02:01.050,00:02:04.000,"this indicates what type of a weight block is inside of it."
00:02:05.140,00:02:06.550,"- What happens over here?"
00:02:06.550,00:02:09.730,"- So this area right here is our urethane area."
00:02:09.730,00:02:11.400,"So basically what we have"
00:02:11.400,00:02:13.900,"are a number of different tanks that are set up."
00:02:13.900,00:02:16.150,"So there's a chemical reaction that occurs"
00:02:16.150,00:02:17.750,"once it actually fills the mold"
00:02:17.750,00:02:20.740,"and we pour that cover stock material around the pour."
00:02:20.740,00:02:23.733,"It gets extremely hot in just a matter of minutes."
00:02:26.170,00:02:27.640,"You go right down here,"
00:02:27.640,00:02:29.500,"she's actually pouring the pin material"
00:02:29.500,00:02:31.490,"inside the tops of those cores."
00:02:31.490,00:02:33.680,"So you can see for this particular bowling ball,"
00:02:33.680,00:02:35.640,"it's a bright orange type of a material,"
00:02:35.640,00:02:37.550,"and she's actually filling that hole"
00:02:37.550,00:02:38.913,"with that plug material."
00:02:41.100,00:02:42.330,"We've got the lane at the right here"
00:02:42.330,00:02:45.110,"which is where we take the balls that come out of the mold."
00:02:45.110,00:02:48.270,"And then they actually spin almost 2000 RPM."
00:02:48.270,00:02:50.780,"On top of there there's the blades that come around"
00:02:50.780,00:02:53.480,"and it actually makes the balls perfectly round."
00:02:53.480,00:02:55.480,"So they'll actually trim those up."
00:02:55.480,00:02:57.230,"- [Derek] Since the balls are not symmetric,"
00:02:57.230,00:02:59.640,"they are heavier on one side than the other."
00:02:59.640,00:03:02.170,"- And you can see there the last four or five pumps of air,"
00:03:02.170,00:03:04.860,"where it actually floats the air then it stops and pauses,"
00:03:04.860,00:03:06.440,"that the ball has completely settled."
00:03:06.440,00:03:08.100,"And then basically a needle will come out"
00:03:08.100,00:03:09.380,"from the bottom part"
00:03:09.380,00:03:11.140,"and all of a sudden it'll shoot it up."
00:03:11.140,00:03:13.150,"And then it'll be where the center of gravity is"
00:03:13.150,00:03:14.500,"on the surface of the ball."
00:03:16.600,00:03:19.400,"- When it comes right off the lane, right here,"
00:03:19.400,00:03:22.160,"it is extremely porous and very, very dull,"
00:03:22.160,00:03:23.900,"and there is a ton of friction"
00:03:23.900,00:03:25.810,"between the ball and the lane at this point."
00:03:25.810,00:03:28.520,"So every ball from right here will be smoothed up,"
00:03:28.520,00:03:31.280,"it's just a matter of how much it's gonna be smoothed up"
00:03:31.280,00:03:33.633,"in order to get what is the desired finish."
00:03:36.680,00:03:38.520,"- [Derek] But before they can use these balls,"
00:03:38.520,00:03:39.890,"they have to be drilled."
00:03:39.890,00:03:41.913,"But that is specific to each bowler."
00:03:42.880,00:03:44.750,"How many balls are you making a day?"
00:03:44.750,00:03:47.533,"- [Steve] We're making over 3000 balls in a day now."
00:03:47.533,00:03:49.523,"they come out of this plant right here."
00:03:50.597,00:03:53.680,"(smooth calm music)"
00:03:58.060,00:03:58.893,"- Wild."
00:03:59.830,00:04:02.527,"I found the bowling ball equivalent of clickbait."
00:04:02.527,00:04:04.317,"""You won't believe your eyes"","
00:04:04.317,00:04:06.037,"""The mind bending hook""."
00:04:07.430,00:04:08.630,"- Right? - Yeah."
00:04:08.630,00:04:09.810,"It's how you have to sell your stuff."
00:04:09.810,00:04:11.720,"I get it. - Exactly. Yeah."
00:04:11.720,00:04:14.730,"- [Derek] But how did it come to be this way?"
00:04:14.730,00:04:17.730,"Well, bowling seems to be an ancient game."
00:04:17.730,00:04:20.120,"Archeologists have found wall drawings of a sport"
00:04:20.120,00:04:23.240,"that looks like bowling in an ancient Egyptian tomb"
00:04:23.240,00:04:26.200,"dating back 7,000 years."
00:04:26.200,00:04:29.440,"In Germany, bowling was used as a religious ritual."
00:04:29.440,00:04:31.510,"Pins represented your sins,"
00:04:31.510,00:04:34.620,"so you're a good Christian if you could knock them all down."
00:04:34.620,00:04:37.360,"Martin Luther himself was apparently a bowling fanatic"
00:04:37.360,00:04:40.130,"and fixed the number of pins at nine."
00:04:40.130,00:04:42.330,"When the game made its way over to America,"
00:04:42.330,00:04:45.860,"nine-pin bowling was banned because it promoted gambling."
00:04:45.860,00:04:48.000,"The legend goes that people cleverly came up with"
00:04:48.000,00:04:50.220,"10-pin bowling to get around the law."
00:04:50.220,00:04:52.720,"Whoa, totally different game."
00:04:52.720,00:04:56.200,"Today in the US, nine-pin bowling is only played in Texas"
00:04:56.200,00:04:58.450,"because it was the one state that didn't ban it,"
00:04:58.450,00:05:00.253,"instead, charging it tax."
00:05:01.820,00:05:04.300,"Bowling lanes are about three-and-a-half-feet wide"
00:05:04.300,00:05:07.130,"and 60 feet long down to the headpin."
00:05:07.130,00:05:08.530,"I'm using Imperial units here"
00:05:08.530,00:05:11.310,"because that's actually how they're defined."
00:05:11.310,00:05:13.870,"The lane is made of 39 narrow boards"
00:05:13.870,00:05:15.820,"that bowlers number for reference."
00:05:15.820,00:05:17.700,"They used to be made of maple and pinewood,"
00:05:17.700,00:05:20.360,"but these days, most lanes are synthetic"
00:05:20.360,00:05:23.770,"and made of fine particles coated with melamine resin."
00:05:23.770,00:05:26.360,"One game of bowling gives you 10 frames"
00:05:26.360,00:05:28.150,"with two throws per frame"
00:05:28.150,00:05:30.490,"to try to knock down all 10 pins."
00:05:30.490,00:05:33.070,"The highest score you can get in a game without a strike"
00:05:33.070,00:05:35.100,"is only 190,"
00:05:35.100,00:05:38.130,"but strikes allow you to double count your next two throws,"
00:05:38.130,00:05:40.320,"so a perfect game with all strikes"
00:05:40.320,00:05:42.323,"gives you a score of 300."
00:05:43.220,00:05:44.390,"If you're anything like me,"
00:05:44.390,00:05:45.590,"the whole game is just"
00:05:45.590,00:05:47.730,"trying to throw the ball as straight as you can"
00:05:47.730,00:05:49.970,"down the middle of the lane, hit the headpin"
00:05:49.970,00:05:53.550,"and try to take as many other pins down with it as possible."
00:05:53.550,00:05:54.640,"Do you wanna give me any tips or-"
00:05:54.640,00:05:56.960,"- I've watched LeBron bowling, you won't be worse than him."
00:05:56.960,00:05:58.321,"- You say that now you."
00:05:58.321,00:06:00.904,"(Chris laughs)"
00:06:02.300,00:06:03.440,"- See, that's what I would normally do."
00:06:03.440,00:06:04.520,"And I would normally be like"
00:06:04.520,00:06:06.370,"reasonably happy with a shot like that."
00:06:06.370,00:06:09.080,"But for pro-bowlers like Pete Weber or Chris Barnes,"
00:06:09.080,00:06:10.617,"- [Narrator] For a perfect game,"
00:06:10.617,00:06:11.720,"- Yes!"
00:06:11.720,00:06:13.540,"- [Derek] The game is different."
00:06:13.540,00:06:15.742,"And not just because they are way better than me."
00:06:15.742,00:06:16.808,"- [Narrator] And he get it!"
00:06:16.808,00:06:17.954,"(crowd cheering)"
00:06:17.954,00:06:20.144,"- Who you think that you are? I am."
00:06:20.144,00:06:23.970,"(crowd continues cheering)"
00:06:23.970,00:06:25.740,"Hitting the headpins square on"
00:06:25.740,00:06:27.683,"is not the perfect strategy."
00:06:29.290,00:06:31.990,"If you hit the headpin square on going straight,"
00:06:31.990,00:06:34.690,"you're unlikely to knock down all the pins."
00:06:34.690,00:06:35.810,"You could end up with a split"
00:06:35.810,00:06:37.260,"where the ball goes through the middle,"
00:06:37.260,00:06:39.420,"or with the ball deflecting off to one side"
00:06:39.420,00:06:41.100,"after hitting the headpin."
00:06:41.100,00:06:43.120,"Chances for a strike are much higher"
00:06:43.120,00:06:45.140,"if the center of the ball hits the pins"
00:06:45.140,00:06:47.360,"just to one side of the headpin."
00:06:47.360,00:06:49.590,"Board 17 and a half."
00:06:49.590,00:06:53.910,"In which case the ball takes out the 1, 3, 5, and 9 pins,"
00:06:53.910,00:06:55.890,"which take out the others."
00:06:55.890,00:06:58.840,"- So we want the ball to hit the 1 pin, the 3,"
00:06:58.840,00:07:01.230,"the pin behind the 1, which is the 5 pin."
00:07:01.230,00:07:03.000,"And then the 9 or the 8 and the 9."
00:07:03.000,00:07:04.552,"- [Derek] You want the ball to hit all of those pins?"
00:07:04.552,00:07:05.385,"- [Chris] Yeah."
00:07:05.385,00:07:07.610,"- Now the pins don't always fall this way,"
00:07:07.610,00:07:09.610,"but the pin shape helps."
00:07:09.610,00:07:11.950,"Pins roll in circles like eggs,"
00:07:11.950,00:07:13.913,"which help knock down the others."
00:07:17.824,00:07:19.400,"- That's right baby!"
00:07:19.400,00:07:20.250,"Come on, don't miss."
00:07:20.250,00:07:22.140,"You wanted it, you got it."
00:07:22.140,00:07:24.110,"- [Derek] But to have an over 90% chance"
00:07:24.110,00:07:25.230,"of getting a strike,"
00:07:25.230,00:07:27.000,"the center of the ball has to hit"
00:07:27.000,00:07:29.680,"with an error smaller than half a board."
00:07:29.680,00:07:31.780,"Needless to say, throwing a ball 60 feet"
00:07:31.780,00:07:35.540,"straight at a target smaller than a dime is a tough task."
00:07:35.540,00:07:38.350,"Especially to do it consistently."
00:07:38.350,00:07:41.380,"Luckily there is a better way."
00:07:41.380,00:07:42.570,"- Now, if we look at the pins"
00:07:42.570,00:07:45.490,"and as you look at them from here, from straight on,"
00:07:45.490,00:07:47.660,"the spot between the headpin,"
00:07:47.660,00:07:48.580,"the one that's in the center,"
00:07:48.580,00:07:50.370,"and the 3 pin which is just right at that,"
00:07:50.370,00:07:52.150,"that gap's pretty narrow."
00:07:52.150,00:07:54.010,"But as the ball hooks more,"
00:07:54.010,00:07:55.910,"now we basically shift over,"
00:07:55.910,00:07:59.040,"and now that space is considerably wider."
00:07:59.040,00:08:01.040,"- [Derek] If you can hit the pins not head-on,"
00:08:01.040,00:08:03.660,"but at an angle of six degrees,"
00:08:03.660,00:08:05.840,"you dramatically increase your chances"
00:08:05.840,00:08:07.530,"of knocking them all down."
00:08:07.530,00:08:10.430,"Now the margin for error is greater."
00:08:10.430,00:08:11.440,"The ball can be coming in"
00:08:11.440,00:08:15.200,"anywhere from board 17 to 18 and a half,"
00:08:15.200,00:08:17.360,"that is a board and a half of room."
00:08:17.360,00:08:18.520,"And that still gives you"
00:08:18.520,00:08:21.660,"greater than a 90% chance of a strike."
00:08:21.660,00:08:23.650,"Now, six degrees may not sound like a lot,"
00:08:23.650,00:08:26.490,"but it's actually extremely difficult to hit."
00:08:26.490,00:08:28.530,"The problem is, if you wanted to throw the ball"
00:08:28.530,00:08:31.250,"straight at the pins and hit them at six degrees,"
00:08:31.250,00:08:35.700,"you would have to be bowling from 3/4 over on the next lane."
00:08:35.700,00:08:37.350,"And that is impossible."
00:08:37.350,00:08:40.060,"Well, with the two gutters in between and all."
00:08:40.060,00:08:41.490,"So the solution is"
00:08:41.490,00:08:44.460,"you've got to curve the ball on one lane."
00:08:44.460,00:08:46.830,"I feel like I have never spun a ball."
00:08:46.830,00:08:48.360,"Is that, (Derek laughs)"
00:08:48.360,00:08:49.330,"Is that hard?"
00:08:49.330,00:08:50.257,"- So if you've got it under your hand"
00:08:50.257,00:08:51.750,"and the ball's underneath,"
00:08:51.750,00:08:53.450,"and you're trying to spin it,"
00:08:53.450,00:08:56.410,"that's especially the motion that players use these days."
00:08:56.410,00:08:57.540,"- [Derek] This really became"
00:08:57.540,00:08:59.820,"a big part of the sport by accident."
00:08:59.820,00:09:01.210,"- The wood gets beat up"
00:09:01.210,00:09:03.650,"with the damage from all the balls going into it."
00:09:03.650,00:09:05.680,"And so they basically created slip agents,"
00:09:05.680,00:09:08.310,"lubricants much like oil on a car"
00:09:08.310,00:09:10.950,"so that the lanes didn't get damaged so quickly."
00:09:10.950,00:09:13.060,"- [Derek] So the original idea was to protect the wood."
00:09:13.060,00:09:14.270,"- The original idea was"
00:09:14.270,00:09:15.810,"just to protect the surface of the lane."
00:09:15.810,00:09:17.990,"It was not to manufacture anything"
00:09:17.990,00:09:20.940,"for my competitive-scoring type environment."
00:09:20.940,00:09:23.300,"- But applying oil to protect the wood"
00:09:23.300,00:09:25.520,"meant that balls no longer grip the lane"
00:09:25.520,00:09:27.680,"and roll without slipping down to the pins."
00:09:27.680,00:09:29.630,"Instead they could skid,"
00:09:29.630,00:09:32.153,"rotating not in their direction of travel."
00:09:35.260,00:09:37.460,"Now, I've been to a lot of bowling alleys"
00:09:37.460,00:09:38.610,"before making this video"
00:09:38.610,00:09:40.380,"and I noticed it was a bit greasy,"
00:09:40.380,00:09:41.840,"but I always thought that was just"
00:09:41.840,00:09:43.490,"the nature of bowling alleys."
00:09:43.490,00:09:45.500,"Like the stinky rental shoes."
00:09:45.500,00:09:48.850,"I didn't know they intentionally put oil on the lanes."
00:09:48.850,00:09:52.810,"Vox has a great video specifically about oil patterns."
00:09:52.810,00:09:54.300,"These days, there are machines"
00:09:54.300,00:09:57.143,"specifically for applying oil to the lanes."
00:09:58.660,00:09:59.927,"- [Chris] And then as proprietors went,"
00:09:59.927,00:10:02.340,"""Huh, well yeah, it does make the ball skid."
00:10:02.340,00:10:04.500,"Well, if I put more in the middle than the outside"
00:10:04.500,00:10:07.330,"my baller's bowl a little bit better and they're happier."""
00:10:07.330,00:10:09.600,"And then as technology advances like everything does"
00:10:09.600,00:10:11.820,"now we have $30,000 lane machines"
00:10:11.820,00:10:14.610,"that can put a specific amount of oil on each board."
00:10:14.610,00:10:17.020,"- [Derek] They work kind of like dot matrix printers."
00:10:17.020,00:10:18.600,"They can lay the oil on"
00:10:18.600,00:10:21.090,"with varying degrees of thickness across the lane"
00:10:21.090,00:10:23.780,"and extend the oil pattern different distances."
00:10:23.780,00:10:27.210,"There are hundreds of different patterns that can be used."
00:10:27.210,00:10:30.670,"Usually the oil extends about 2/3 the way down the lane,"
00:10:30.670,00:10:33.210,"so to around 40 or 45 feet."
00:10:33.210,00:10:36.150,"But there's always a dry patch of wood before the pins"
00:10:36.150,00:10:38.380,"that increases the friction with the ball,"
00:10:38.380,00:10:41.350,"getting it to start rolling without slipping."
00:10:41.350,00:10:44.793,"And this leads to the three parts of any pro bowler's throw."
00:10:46.000,00:10:46.833,"The skid,"
00:10:47.800,00:10:49.100,"the hook"
00:10:49.100,00:10:50.373,"and the roll."
00:10:51.650,00:10:53.190,"When a bowler releases the ball,"
00:10:53.190,00:10:55.420,"it can be going 20 miles an hour"
00:10:55.420,00:10:57.810,"and spinning at 500 RPM."
00:10:57.810,00:11:00.690,"That's nearly 10 full revolutions per second."
00:11:00.690,00:11:02.700,"Right-handers typically throw the ball to the right"
00:11:02.700,00:11:05.260,"on the lane while spinning it to the left."
00:11:05.260,00:11:08.100,"During the skid phase, the ball slides down the lane"
00:11:08.100,00:11:10.160,"spinning but not rolling."
00:11:10.160,00:11:11.620,"As it comes to the end of the oil,"
00:11:11.620,00:11:15.770,"the friction increases and the ball accelerates to the left."
00:11:15.770,00:11:17.970,"It hooks because of its spin,"
00:11:17.970,00:11:20.710,"and the spin starts lining up with the direction of travel,"
00:11:20.710,00:11:23.260,"leading to stage three, roll."
00:11:23.260,00:11:25.050,"The ball is rolling without slipping"
00:11:25.050,00:11:26.850,"as it barrels into the pins."
00:11:26.850,00:11:30.113,"Ideally, as close to that six degree angle as possible."
00:11:32.960,00:11:36.200,"Like the ball starts on the left side of the lane,"
00:11:36.200,00:11:39.531,"goes straight across almost rightmost."
00:11:39.531,00:11:43.020,"Then hooks like at the last minute, rolls in there."
00:11:43.020,00:11:45.560,"So that's almost like a perfect shot, right?"
00:11:45.560,00:11:47.320,"straight in the pocket there. - Close."
00:11:47.320,00:11:49.220,"- Yeah. That's where you want to hit the pins."
00:11:49.220,00:11:50.863,"Yeah."
00:11:50.863,00:11:54.030,"(ball hits the floor)"
00:11:55.460,00:11:57.020,"- My very first game,"
00:11:57.020,00:12:00.000,"it was ABC back then, American Bowling Congress."
00:12:00.000,00:12:02.460,"I filled out the application to bowl in men's league."
00:12:02.460,00:12:05.540,"Dad gave them the letter saying that I could,"
00:12:05.540,00:12:07.627,"and the first game of bowl was 300"
00:12:07.627,00:12:09.690,"and they handed me a hundred dollars too,"
00:12:09.690,00:12:12.140,"and it was like, yeah, making money now."
00:12:12.140,00:12:16.330,"And actually, my first, my sixth, my ninth,"
00:12:16.330,00:12:19.720,"my 13th, 17th, 20th"
00:12:19.720,00:12:21.350,"were all 300 games."
00:12:21.350,00:12:23.000,"I like, seven or eight 300"
00:12:23.964,00:12:25.610,"in my first year of men's league."
00:12:25.610,00:12:26.700,"- [Derek] How do you explain that?"
00:12:26.700,00:12:28.180,"- To shoot 300"
00:12:28.180,00:12:30.530,"you have to get lucky somewhere along the line."
00:12:35.245,00:12:36.655,"Like that. (Derek laughs)"
00:12:36.655,00:12:37.790,"Like that."
00:12:37.790,00:12:41.170,"It came in to hit the 1 3, 5, 9."
00:12:41.170,00:12:43.763,"And that that's what we call the perfect shot."
00:12:49.970,00:12:51.940,"- I mean, you just keep hitting them."
00:12:51.940,00:12:54.351,"That's almost the identical shot."
00:12:54.351,00:12:55.870,"Look at that, that yellow and the purple,"
00:12:55.870,00:12:58.470,"they're almost exactly on top of each other."
00:12:58.470,00:12:59.870,"- Oh, it just goes a little bit straight."
00:12:59.870,00:13:01.340,"- That one, the purple one"
00:13:01.340,00:13:04.030,"was just a little bit higher on the head pin,"
00:13:04.030,00:13:06.893,"but it still hit the 1, 3 and the 5 and the 9."
00:13:08.800,00:13:09.900,"Can't get much better."
00:13:11.420,00:13:13.640,"- [Derek] This type of throw is only possible"
00:13:13.640,00:13:15.230,"because of the oil."
00:13:15.230,00:13:18.410,"If you try to throw a ball the same way on an unoiled lane."
00:13:18.410,00:13:19.700,"Oh no."
00:13:19.700,00:13:21.660,"It just doesn't work."
00:13:21.660,00:13:25.310,"Can I actually ask you to bowl like you normally would,"
00:13:25.310,00:13:26.543,"but on the dry lane?"
00:13:27.640,00:13:28.860,"I know it's crazy."
00:13:28.860,00:13:31.030,"I just want to see what like a normal shot would look like"
00:13:31.030,00:13:32.680,"If there was no oil. - No oil."
00:13:32.680,00:13:34.660,"It's gonna hit the lane and go in the left gutter."
00:13:34.660,00:13:35.493,"- That's what I want to see."
00:13:35.493,00:13:36.326,"- All right."
00:13:36.326,00:13:38.120,"You're gonna throw it just like it's a regular lane."
00:13:38.120,00:13:39.233,"- Yeah. - All right."
00:13:47.301,00:13:48.730,"- Oh yeah, there's no oil on the lane"
00:13:48.730,00:13:50.790,"so the ball can't get down."
00:13:50.790,00:13:52.170,"As soon as it hits the lane,"
00:13:52.170,00:13:53.740,"it's going to start hooking, you know?"
00:13:53.740,00:13:56.390,"'Cause if you do this, who's skidding a ball on this."
00:13:57.380,00:13:58.820,"- So they want the oil."
00:13:58.820,00:14:00.063,"- Yeah. We need the oil."
00:14:00.900,00:14:03.020,"If we didn't have oil, this is what it would be."
00:14:03.020,00:14:04.683,"And nobody would have fun."
00:14:05.900,00:14:07.620,"This is not fun. - The bowling sucks,"
00:14:07.620,00:14:09.062,"We don't want to do this."
00:14:09.062,00:14:09.990,"(Derek laughs)"
00:14:09.990,00:14:12.100,"- For pro bowlers, the oil on the lane"
00:14:12.100,00:14:13.903,"is a key part of the game."
00:14:14.960,00:14:15.793,"- Oh whoa."
00:14:16.880,00:14:18.070,"- Wow. Hey."
00:14:18.070,00:14:20.160,"- Do you look at the oil?"
00:14:20.160,00:14:21.970,"Are you trying to scope it out"
00:14:21.970,00:14:22.910,"or are you just kind of guessing?"
00:14:22.910,00:14:24.700,"- I usually don't look at the oil."
00:14:24.700,00:14:26.790,"I let my ball be the guide."
00:14:26.790,00:14:28.780,"You know, I know some guys that are,"
00:14:28.780,00:14:31.210,"you know, they get down like this and they look in"
00:14:31.210,00:14:33.270,"and it's like, oh, you know,"
00:14:33.270,00:14:34.600,"they're seeing the same thing I do"
00:14:34.600,00:14:37.040,"when I sit down, I go like that."
00:14:37.040,00:14:38.220,"Nothing."
00:14:38.220,00:14:39.900,"I see absolutely nothing."
00:14:39.900,00:14:41.420,"- Whether you can see it or not,"
00:14:41.420,00:14:43.180,"figuring out the condition of oil on the lane"
00:14:43.180,00:14:45.883,"can make the difference between a strike and a miss."
00:14:48.960,00:14:52.530,"As the game wears on the bowling balls move the oil around,"
00:14:52.530,00:14:53.930,"pushing it further down the lane"
00:14:53.930,00:14:56.543,"and stripping it off the most common paths."
00:14:58.410,00:15:01.550,"So players have to adjust to the changing conditions."
00:15:01.550,00:15:03.740,"Some people say left-handers have an advantage"
00:15:03.740,00:15:05.930,"because right-handers aren't playing"
00:15:05.930,00:15:07.960,"on their side of the lane."
00:15:07.960,00:15:09.030,"At most bowling alleys,"
00:15:09.030,00:15:11.640,"they use a pattern of oil that is thicker in the middle"
00:15:11.640,00:15:13.930,"and thinner out toward the edges."
00:15:13.930,00:15:15.710,"This is a forgiving layout"
00:15:15.710,00:15:19.550,"because balls that drift too far out start to hook earlier,"
00:15:19.550,00:15:20.710,"while balls going straighter"
00:15:20.710,00:15:22.720,"can continue down the lane for longer"
00:15:22.720,00:15:25.540,"before making their turn into the pins."
00:15:25.540,00:15:28.200,"But for pro bowlers, the oil conditions vary"
00:15:28.200,00:15:31.000,"and players have to adjust their games to the conditions."
00:15:31.000,00:15:33.090,"Some people seem to think that like league bowlers"
00:15:33.090,00:15:34.380,"are better than they are, maybe,"
00:15:34.380,00:15:35.730,"'cause they say like, ""Oh, this league bowler"
00:15:35.730,00:15:38.690,"can shoot two 10, and I just saw pro shoot two 10."""
00:15:38.690,00:15:39.960,"- That's why they call it league"
00:15:39.960,00:15:42.200,"because you bowl on the same shot every week."
00:15:42.200,00:15:43.570,"Because each week on tour,"
00:15:43.570,00:15:45.340,"I'm bowling on a different condition."
00:15:45.340,00:15:47.190,"Not the same condition every week."
00:15:47.190,00:15:51.240,"We have Cheetah, Chameleon, Scorpion, shark,"
00:15:51.240,00:15:52.750,"one more. - Bear?"
00:15:52.750,00:15:53.900,"- Bear. Yeah."
00:15:53.900,00:15:55.890,"- [Derek] But it's not just the oil on the lanes"
00:15:55.890,00:15:57.990,"that is transformed bowling."
00:15:57.990,00:16:00.260,"It's also the balls themselves."
00:16:00.260,00:16:03.420,"- Hard rubber bowling balls was what I started with."
00:16:03.420,00:16:05.740,"Maybe mid 70's and then the Yellow Dot,"
00:16:05.740,00:16:08.490,"the Columbia Yellow Dot, which is a plastic ball."
00:16:08.490,00:16:11.140,"And then they came out with urethane bowling balls."
00:16:11.140,00:16:13.550,"I won a lot of titles with the urethane stuff."
00:16:13.550,00:16:15.000,"And then they come out with the"
00:16:15.000,00:16:16.730,"reactive resin bowling balls."
00:16:16.730,00:16:20.030,"- [Derek] Reactive resin is just a modified polyurethane"
00:16:20.030,00:16:21.700,"with a more porous surface,"
00:16:21.700,00:16:23.840,"which gives it more grip in the oil."
00:16:23.840,00:16:26.750,"It's the most popular surface or cover stock"
00:16:26.750,00:16:28.590,"for bowling balls today."
00:16:28.590,00:16:31.920,"Balls started out as perfect symmetrically-weighted spheres."
00:16:31.920,00:16:33.470,"And when you go to a bowling alley,"
00:16:33.470,00:16:36.250,"the house balls there are still just that."
00:16:36.250,00:16:38.150,"But when you drill holes in the ball,"
00:16:38.150,00:16:40.300,"you take some weight out of one side."
00:16:40.300,00:16:42.610,"So to rebalance it, ball manufacturers"
00:16:42.610,00:16:46.030,"added a small pancake weight on the same side as the holes."
00:16:46.030,00:16:48.060,"But then ball manufacturers got the idea,"
00:16:48.060,00:16:50.240,"they could add different weights inside the ball"
00:16:50.240,00:16:52.460,"to improve their performance."
00:16:52.460,00:16:55.290,"You can have two balls that look identical from the outside,"
00:16:55.290,00:16:57.310,"weigh exactly the same amount,"
00:16:57.310,00:16:59.890,"and yet roll differently."
00:16:59.890,00:17:01.830,"If the mass is more concentrated"
00:17:01.830,00:17:03.410,"around the axis of rotation,"
00:17:03.410,00:17:06.380,"say you have a dense cylinder inside the ball."
00:17:06.380,00:17:08.920,"Well then it has a lower moment of inertia."
00:17:08.920,00:17:11.570,"And this means for the same amount of energy input,"
00:17:11.570,00:17:13.410,"it will spin faster."
00:17:13.410,00:17:16.610,"In bowling, they prefer to talk about an analogous concept."
00:17:16.610,00:17:19.290,"Radius of gyration or RG."
00:17:19.290,00:17:22.330,"If you were to concentrate the entire mass of the ball"
00:17:22.330,00:17:24.940,"onto a hoop with the same moment of inertia,"
00:17:24.940,00:17:28.300,"it's radius would be the radius of gyration."
00:17:28.300,00:17:30.200,"So smaller radius of gyration"
00:17:30.200,00:17:32.600,"just means lower moment of inertia,"
00:17:32.600,00:17:34.450,"which translates into more rotation"
00:17:34.450,00:17:36.680,"that a bowler can get on the ball."
00:17:36.680,00:17:38.110,"- Some people are lower leverage"
00:17:38.110,00:17:40.090,"it just spins faster, like,"
00:17:40.090,00:17:42.220,"eh, it's of crazy, and then"
00:17:42.220,00:17:43.320,"somebody finally did a study on that."
00:17:43.320,00:17:44.750,"Yeah, it turns out,"
00:17:44.750,00:17:49.480,"yeah, it's like 8%, you know, for every 0.05."
00:17:49.480,00:17:51.330,"And so it depends on what your leverage is."
00:17:51.330,00:17:53.430,"Can be fairly significant."
00:17:53.430,00:17:55.480,"- [Derek] An ability to spin the balls faster,"
00:17:55.480,00:17:57.890,"gives a bowler the ability to hook the ball"
00:17:57.890,00:18:00.160,"more sharply further down the lane,"
00:18:00.160,00:18:02.060,"giving them a better chance of achieving"
00:18:02.060,00:18:04.270,"that six degree entry angle."
00:18:04.270,00:18:05.770,"What was amazing for me to learn"
00:18:05.770,00:18:07.520,"is that the weight blocks in these balls"
00:18:07.520,00:18:09.270,"aren't even centered."
00:18:09.270,00:18:12.770,"There's a heavy side and a lighter side on purpose,"
00:18:12.770,00:18:14.930,"and you can find and mark this side"
00:18:14.930,00:18:17.760,"by letting the ball spin freely on a cushion of air,"
00:18:17.760,00:18:20.780,"until it comes to rest, heavy side down."
00:18:20.780,00:18:22.400,"They showed me a great demonstration"
00:18:22.400,00:18:24.320,"of how the position of the center of gravity"
00:18:24.320,00:18:26.363,"can affect the movement of the ball."
00:18:27.420,00:18:29.670,"When the center of mass is on the left side of the ball,"
00:18:29.670,00:18:32.420,"it pulls in the same direction as the spin,"
00:18:32.420,00:18:35.130,"helping the ball hook to the left, into the pins,"
00:18:35.130,00:18:37.740,"- Same exact ball, same numbers,"
00:18:37.740,00:18:41.750,"just different static and balance basically."
00:18:41.750,00:18:43.830,"- [Derek] But here is a flipped bowling ball"
00:18:43.830,00:18:45.883,"where the center of mass is on the right."
00:18:46.770,00:18:49.410,"Now the ball starts to hook into the left,"
00:18:49.410,00:18:52.300,"but at the end, something weird happens."
00:18:52.300,00:18:55.690,"The center of mass pulls it over to the right."
00:18:55.690,00:18:57.680,"This effect is only really noticeable"
00:18:57.680,00:18:59.563,"when the ball is thrown slowly."
00:19:01.660,00:19:03.980,"These days, there are tons of different weight blocks"
00:19:03.980,00:19:05.620,"that go inside bowling balls"
00:19:05.620,00:19:07.850,"and they can be grouped into two categories,"
00:19:07.850,00:19:10.210,"symmetric and asymmetric."
00:19:10.210,00:19:11.840,"For all these weight blocks,"
00:19:11.840,00:19:13.390,"the minimum moment of inertia"
00:19:13.390,00:19:16.520,"or in bowling terms, the smallest RG axis"
00:19:16.520,00:19:18.520,"is identified by a pin,"
00:19:18.520,00:19:20.930,"which is visible on the outside of the ball."
00:19:20.930,00:19:23.940,"It will spin most easily about this axis."
00:19:23.940,00:19:25.530,"For the symmetric weight blocks."
00:19:25.530,00:19:28.790,"The ball doesn't change as you rotate it about this axis."
00:19:28.790,00:19:31.030,"So the maximum moment of inertia"
00:19:31.030,00:19:33.220,"is rotating about any axis that passes"
00:19:33.220,00:19:35.333,"through the equator of the ball."
00:19:36.230,00:19:37.950,"I certainly didn't expect bowling balls"
00:19:37.950,00:19:39.690,"to have asymmetric cores,"
00:19:39.690,00:19:42.830,"but it turns out what looked like perfect spheres,"
00:19:42.830,00:19:46.420,"actually have three different principal axes of rotation."
00:19:46.420,00:19:47.740,"Minimum moment of inertia,"
00:19:47.740,00:19:49.040,"maximum moment of inertia"
00:19:49.040,00:19:51.650,"and intermediate moment of inertia."
00:19:51.650,00:19:53.150,"- So this right here is our Dark Code."
00:19:53.150,00:19:54.763,"This is one of our asymmetric ball"
00:19:54.763,00:19:56.940,"that has the Rad 4 core in it."
00:19:56.940,00:19:59.040,"So this has a preferred spin axis."
00:19:59.040,00:19:59.916,"And what we're going to do now"
00:19:59.916,00:20:01.650,"is we're going to put it onto the determinator"
00:20:01.650,00:20:03.750,"and show how it actually will spin it and find it"
00:20:03.750,00:20:05.650,"no matter how we position it on there."
00:20:06.700,00:20:08.430,"- [Derek] So you spin them up on this machine"
00:20:08.430,00:20:11.560,"until they settle into the way they like to spin"
00:20:11.560,00:20:15.800,"where the bowlers call their preferred spin axis or PSA."
00:20:15.800,00:20:19.330,"But why would you want a ball to be an asymmetric top?"
00:20:19.330,00:20:21.610,"Well, professional bowlers drill their balls"
00:20:21.610,00:20:25.750,"so that at lunch the axis of rotation is somewhere between"
00:20:25.750,00:20:28.410,"the minimum and maximum moment of inertia."
00:20:28.410,00:20:31.630,"And as a result, as the ball goes down the lane spinning,"
00:20:31.630,00:20:34.400,"it precesses like a gyroscope."
00:20:34.400,00:20:36.640,"The axis of rotation rotates around"
00:20:36.640,00:20:38.140,"causing the point of contact"
00:20:38.140,00:20:40.980,"between the ball and the lane to change."
00:20:40.980,00:20:42.900,"This precession means that"
00:20:42.900,00:20:45.600,"different parts of the ball contact the lane."
00:20:45.600,00:20:47.870,"And you can see this when the ball back"
00:20:47.870,00:20:50.980,"by the spread-out lines of oil on the ball surface."
00:20:50.980,00:20:52.660,"Bowlers call this track flare,"
00:20:52.660,00:20:54.200,"and it's desirable because it means"
00:20:54.200,00:20:57.010,"once the ball hits the unoiled part of the lane,"
00:20:57.010,00:20:58.430,"it gets traction faster"
00:20:58.430,00:21:00.680,"and hooks more dramatically back to the pins."
00:21:01.610,00:21:04.200,"This is what asymmetric cores are used for."
00:21:04.200,00:21:05.380,"They have larger differences"
00:21:05.380,00:21:08.180,"between their moments of inertia in different axes"
00:21:08.180,00:21:10.480,"or what bowlers call RG differential,"
00:21:10.480,00:21:12.830,"which makes the ball precess."
00:21:12.830,00:21:14.820,"If you spin a ball around it's minimum"
00:21:14.820,00:21:17.950,"or maximum moment of inertia, it processes less"
00:21:17.950,00:21:19.690,"and there's much less flair,"
00:21:19.690,00:21:23.290,"meaning oil builds up on one part of the ball."
00:21:23.290,00:21:26.330,"This reduces the friction over the dry part of the lane"
00:21:26.330,00:21:28.520,"so the ball hooks less."
00:21:28.520,00:21:30.220,"- See the oil there, very faintly,"
00:21:30.220,00:21:32.940,"but it's pretty much next to the finger,"
00:21:32.940,00:21:34.200,"right next to the thumb,"
00:21:34.200,00:21:37.280,"and it just continues to be right that way"
00:21:37.280,00:21:39.120,"all the way around the ball."
00:21:39.120,00:21:40.760,"- [Derek] But how important are"
00:21:40.760,00:21:43.920,"each of these factors in actually getting the best shot?"
00:21:43.920,00:21:45.370,"Well, the US Bowling Congress,"
00:21:45.370,00:21:48.630,"or USBC, the governing body that sets all rules"
00:21:48.630,00:21:50.590,"and regulations for US bowling."
00:21:50.590,00:21:52.930,"They did a landmark study in 2008,"
00:21:52.930,00:21:55.460,"trying to tease out the most significant factors"
00:21:55.460,00:21:57.250,"that affect ball motion."
00:21:57.250,00:21:59.890,"In order to determine the impact of each factor,"
00:21:59.890,00:22:02.780,"they had to make sure that throws were identical."
00:22:02.780,00:22:04.540,"So they turned to Harry,"
00:22:04.540,00:22:07.850,"at the time, the most consistent bowler in the world."
00:22:07.850,00:22:09.483,"He is a robot."
00:22:10.350,00:22:12.590,"Bowling robots are designed to be able to throw"
00:22:12.590,00:22:14.720,"hundreds of identical shots."
00:22:14.720,00:22:16.160,"In fact, the robot Earl,"
00:22:16.160,00:22:18.320,"Harry's successor in 2011,"
00:22:18.320,00:22:21.090,"actually lost to Chris Barnes when he debuted"
00:22:21.090,00:22:23.970,"in part because his throws were so consistent."
00:22:23.970,00:22:27.240,"He wore away the oil in a single part of the lane."
00:22:27.240,00:22:29.960,"So his shots hooked too much."
00:22:29.960,00:22:31.130,"The people managing him"
00:22:31.130,00:22:34.110,"did their best to adjust to the oil conditions,"
00:22:34.110,00:22:37.170,"but few people are Chris Barnes."
00:22:37.170,00:22:39.090,"The USBC ball motion study"
00:22:39.090,00:22:41.190,"used Harry to throw thousands of shots"
00:22:41.190,00:22:42.590,"with different bowling balls."
00:22:42.590,00:22:44.400,"And they found that the center of gravity"
00:22:44.400,00:22:46.760,"affected the ball motion relatively little."
00:22:46.760,00:22:49.750,"Around the same level as environmental factors"
00:22:49.750,00:22:52.430,"like room temperature or humidity."
00:22:52.430,00:22:54.370,"RG, and RG differential,"
00:22:54.370,00:22:55.960,"essentially the moment of inertia"
00:22:55.960,00:22:57.420,"and difference between maximum"
00:22:57.420,00:22:59.150,"and minimum moments of inertia."
00:22:59.150,00:23:02.090,"That affected the ball motion significantly more."
00:23:02.090,00:23:05.260,"But the factor that affected ball motion the most"
00:23:05.260,00:23:07.550,"was the surface of the ball."
00:23:07.550,00:23:10.120,"The top five individual factors were"
00:23:10.120,00:23:12.260,"the amplitude of surface roughness,"
00:23:12.260,00:23:15.360,"meaning the height of microscopic spikes on the ball,"
00:23:15.360,00:23:18.600,"the coefficient of friction with an oiled lane,"
00:23:18.600,00:23:20.700,"the surface roughness by spacing."
00:23:20.700,00:23:23.560,"That is the distance between microscopic spikes,"
00:23:23.560,00:23:26.250,"the coefficient of friction with the dry lane,"
00:23:26.250,00:23:29.660,"and how quickly the ball surface absorbs oil."
00:23:29.660,00:23:31.730,"Now, bowlers recognize just how important"
00:23:31.730,00:23:33.420,"the surface of their ball is."
00:23:33.420,00:23:35.630,"They pay close attention to what it's made of"
00:23:35.630,00:23:37.240,"and how it's finished."
00:23:37.240,00:23:38.140,"Rougher finishes,"
00:23:38.140,00:23:39.950,"give the ball more traction in the oil"
00:23:39.950,00:23:42.150,"and get it to start hooking earlier."
00:23:42.150,00:23:44.510,"This is useful for long oil patterns"
00:23:44.510,00:23:46.340,"and slower axis rotation."
00:23:46.340,00:23:50.310,"- Sometimes maybe I'll go to a little more sanded ball"
00:23:50.310,00:23:52.530,"or a little more ball surface"
00:23:52.530,00:23:54.750,"to get it into a roll quicker for me,"
00:23:54.750,00:23:56.610,"because they use a lot of oil."
00:23:56.610,00:23:58.840,"- These two shots are thrown identically."
00:23:58.840,00:24:01.280,"The only difference is the ball on the left"
00:24:01.280,00:24:02.733,"has a rougher surface."
00:24:06.160,00:24:08.490,"Rough surfaces act like winter tires,"
00:24:08.490,00:24:12.230,"helping to dig into the oil and give the ball traction."
00:24:12.230,00:24:15.900,"They also act as badly as winter tires on a clean road"
00:24:15.900,00:24:17.440,"on a totally dry lane."
00:24:17.440,00:24:19.010,"They actually have less friction"
00:24:19.010,00:24:20.760,"because their rougher exteriors"
00:24:20.760,00:24:23.363,"mean that less surface area is touching the lane."
00:24:24.350,00:24:26.940,"You can get many different levels of smoothness"
00:24:26.940,00:24:29.330,"up to a near mirror shine."
00:24:29.330,00:24:31.410,"This is better for short oil patterns"
00:24:31.410,00:24:34.400,"to prevent the ball hooking too much, too early."
00:24:34.400,00:24:37.010,"Ultimately, pro bowlers carry many different balls"
00:24:37.010,00:24:38.120,"to each competition."
00:24:38.120,00:24:40.660,"- I'm not afraid to change balls in the middle of the game."
00:24:40.660,00:24:43.270,"I go to the game and I've got like"
00:24:43.270,00:24:45.410,"a spare, a spare, a spare."
00:24:45.410,00:24:47.060,"All right. It's time to change balls."
00:24:47.060,00:24:47.893,"- [Derek] Yeah."
00:24:47.893,00:24:49.880,"- So now I gotta find the right ball to"
00:24:49.880,00:24:52.360,"get down the lane again and find the proper,"
00:24:52.360,00:24:54.350,"which usually I have a pretty good idea."
00:24:54.350,00:24:55.720,"- [Derek] So they select their ball"
00:24:55.720,00:24:58.120,"a little like a golfer selects their club,"
00:24:58.120,00:24:59.753,"to suit the conditions."
00:25:00.830,00:25:04.100,"But does all this tech actually make people better bowlers?"
00:25:04.100,00:25:05.680,"Well, over the last 20 years,"
00:25:05.680,00:25:09.010,"average scores have increased by more than five points."
00:25:09.010,00:25:11.190,"Plus the number of perfect 300 games"
00:25:11.190,00:25:13.300,"bowled per year per thousand bowlers"
00:25:13.300,00:25:16.560,"has increased dramatically since the 1980s."
00:25:16.560,00:25:20.410,"This graph shows the percent change year over year."
00:25:20.410,00:25:22.590,"In 1976, soaker balls,"
00:25:22.590,00:25:25.770,"balls chemically softened to absorb oil and hook more,"
00:25:25.770,00:25:29.290,"were banned, and there was a dip in perfect games."
00:25:29.290,00:25:31.840,"But the same year a new rubber ball was introduced,"
00:25:31.840,00:25:33.860,"the Brunswick LT-48"
00:25:33.860,00:25:37.330,"and more 300 were hit in the years that followed."
00:25:37.330,00:25:40.200,"In 1991, reactive resin balls were introduced"
00:25:40.200,00:25:42.660,"and there was another significant jump."
00:25:42.660,00:25:45.460,"Now, obviously there were other improvements in equipment"
00:25:45.460,00:25:47.340,"and natural variability,"
00:25:47.340,00:25:49.530,"but some of the big changes do correlate"
00:25:49.530,00:25:52.350,"with the introduction of new ball technology."
00:25:52.350,00:25:55.370,"So yes, the wild bowling ball technologies out there,"
00:25:55.370,00:25:57.580,"especially anything to do with surface,"
00:25:57.580,00:26:01.840,"significantly affect ball motion and your bowling game."
00:26:01.840,00:26:04.060,"But ball motion is likely minutely affected"
00:26:04.060,00:26:05.770,"by hundreds of other factors."
00:26:05.770,00:26:08.510,"Even the color of the ball can have a small impact."
00:26:08.510,00:26:10.790,"A USBC study in 2016"
00:26:10.790,00:26:15.430,"found that different pigments absorb oil at different rates."
00:26:15.430,00:26:18.050,"Bowling is the sport of re-invention."
00:26:18.050,00:26:19.740,"That goes back to ancient Egypt,"
00:26:19.740,00:26:22.380,"but has transformed many times."
00:26:22.380,00:26:24.460,"Now, when you get up to throw a single shot,"
00:26:24.460,00:26:27.500,"you have to think about the oil pattern on the lane,"
00:26:27.500,00:26:30.160,"the stage of the game and how the pattern has shifted,"
00:26:30.160,00:26:31.590,"the weight block in your ball,"
00:26:31.590,00:26:33.810,"whether you want symmetric or asymmetric,"
00:26:33.810,00:26:37.290,"which axis you'll spin it about to affect precession,"
00:26:37.290,00:26:38.430,"where the center of mass is"
00:26:38.430,00:26:39.803,"to pull the ball to the left, to the right,"
00:26:39.803,00:26:41.620,"what the cover stock is made of"
00:26:41.620,00:26:43.670,"and whether it's rough or smooth,"
00:26:43.670,00:26:47.080,"all to make a shot that skids, hooks, and rolls"
00:26:47.080,00:26:50.240,"to the pins between boards 17 and 18 and a half"
00:26:50.240,00:26:53.223,"at as close to a six degree angle as you can master."
00:26:55.720,00:26:57.960,"Now do that again 12 times in a row"
00:26:57.960,00:27:00.474,"and you have a perfect game."
00:27:00.474,00:27:03.641,"(techno sound effect)"
