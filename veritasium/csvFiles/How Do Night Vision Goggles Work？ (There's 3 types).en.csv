00:00:00.330,00:00:01.410,"- What happens when you take"
00:00:01.410,00:00:03.900,"the world's best night vision goggles"
00:00:03.900,00:00:05.910,"into the world's darkest room?"
00:00:05.910,00:00:07.620,"- You start to feel a little strange."
00:00:07.620,00:00:10.710,"And sometimes start to get a little bit of vertigo."
00:00:10.710,00:00:11.543,"- Can you tell the difference"
00:00:11.543,00:00:13.560,"between your eyes being closed and open?"
00:00:13.560,00:00:15.993,"- Should not be able to. It'll be that dark."
00:00:16.920,00:00:18.630,"- Three - Basically zero light"
00:00:18.630,00:00:19.530,"in here. - Two."
00:00:19.530,00:00:20.363,"- Almost no photons."
00:00:20.363,00:00:21.480,"Invisible. That's right."
00:00:21.480,00:00:23.223,"- One. - Oh, I'm ready."
00:00:24.630,00:00:26.059,"- Pitch darkness."
00:00:26.059,00:00:30.660,"(laughs) No way. This is insane."
00:00:30.660,00:00:34.560,"These are the PVS-31As. That is incredible."
00:00:34.560,00:00:36.810,"One of the best night vision goggles in the world."
00:00:36.810,00:00:39.210,"It is literally like night and day."
00:00:39.210,00:00:41.640,"We visited a Navy base in Crane, Indiana"
00:00:41.640,00:00:44.673,"to put them to the test in all kinds of darkness."
00:00:45.930,00:00:47.493,"Now things are gonna get real."
00:00:49.740,00:00:51.900,"It's my first time looking through night vision goggles."
00:00:51.900,00:00:53.430,"- I'm going to pan these down."
00:00:54.420,00:00:56.940,"- Oh wow. (laughs)"
00:00:56.940,00:00:58.650,"Oh my God."
00:00:58.650,00:01:01.080,"To make a video about night vision goggles,"
00:01:01.080,00:01:05.130,"we had to film in the pitch dark, which is really hard,"
00:01:05.130,00:01:08.010,"because cameras work by focusing photons"
00:01:08.010,00:01:10.110,"of light down onto a sensor."
00:01:10.110,00:01:12.300,"And there, the photons knock off electrons,"
00:01:12.300,00:01:13.560,"generating a charge,"
00:01:13.560,00:01:15.390,"which is converted into a voltage"
00:01:15.390,00:01:18.660,"and digitized into ones and zeros for each pixel."
00:01:18.660,00:01:21.750,"Now, there's a setting we made use of, which is called ISO,"
00:01:21.750,00:01:24.000,"which essentially boosts that voltage"
00:01:24.000,00:01:25.833,"to make the whole image brighter."
00:01:26.730,00:01:29.520,"For reference, this is what a scene lit only"
00:01:29.520,00:01:31.530,"by a single candle looks like"
00:01:31.530,00:01:35.100,"at an elevated ISO of 6,400."
00:01:35.100,00:01:37.080,"Now, in a split screen,"
00:01:37.080,00:01:41.610,"let me show you what this looks like at an ISO of 64,000."
00:01:41.610,00:01:45.270,"Now you can see a lot more detail in the shadows."
00:01:45.270,00:01:47.670,"This is pretty similar to the level of detail"
00:01:47.670,00:01:51.060,"that the human eye can see in low-light situations."
00:01:51.060,00:01:53.070,"And now this is what it looks like"
00:01:53.070,00:01:57.870,"on our camera's maximum ISO of 409,600."
00:01:57.870,00:02:00.090,"All the dark scenes in this video were shot"
00:02:00.090,00:02:02.850,"at this maximum ISO."
00:02:02.850,00:02:06.423,"But look how dark it is compared to just a single candle."
00:02:07.470,00:02:10.020,"This is because the Navy base was located"
00:02:10.020,00:02:11.550,"in the middle of nowhere,"
00:02:11.550,00:02:14.340,"and we turned off all the streetlights."
00:02:14.340,00:02:15.300,"All right."
00:02:15.300,00:02:17.790,"Plus, we planned the shoot specifically"
00:02:17.790,00:02:19.530,"for a moonless night."
00:02:19.530,00:02:20.700,"In these conditions,"
00:02:20.700,00:02:23.310,"I'm gonna try to drive a military tactical vehicle"
00:02:23.310,00:02:26.670,"with nothing but night vision goggles on for sight."
00:02:26.670,00:02:27.963,"I hope that's in drive."
00:02:30.090,00:02:33.660,"But the type of night vision goggles you use is essential."
00:02:33.660,00:02:36.720,"All affordable night vision goggles work the same way,"
00:02:36.720,00:02:38.130,"and they're basically the same"
00:02:38.130,00:02:41.220,"as strapping a flashlight onto your head."
00:02:41.220,00:02:42.900,"Except the light they give off"
00:02:42.900,00:02:45.840,"is not visible, but near infrared,"
00:02:45.840,00:02:48.660,"wavelengths that are just longer than our eyes can see."
00:02:48.660,00:02:51.030,"Then they have a camera that can capture"
00:02:51.030,00:02:52.950,"that near-infrared light"
00:02:52.950,00:02:57.060,"and display what the camera sees on a screen on the back."
00:02:57.060,00:03:00.270,"This is the simplest and cheapest version of night vision."
00:03:00.270,00:03:03.240,"It's called active illumination."
00:03:03.240,00:03:06.210,"There are actually three different types of night vision."
00:03:06.210,00:03:09.360,"- Night vision is different categories of technologies:"
00:03:09.360,00:03:11.760,"ones that create their own light,"
00:03:11.760,00:03:14.610,"ones that amplify existing light,"
00:03:14.610,00:03:18.540,"and ones that image in the emissive infrared bands."
00:03:18.540,00:03:19.680,"- And while the other types"
00:03:19.680,00:03:21.720,"of night vision can cost thousands,"
00:03:21.720,00:03:24.933,"our active illuminators cost less than $200."
00:03:25.860,00:03:27.861,"It's very zoomed in, I feel like."
00:03:27.861,00:03:29.130,"(laughter)"
00:03:29.130,00:03:30.203,"- It's not a one-to-one?"
00:03:30.203,00:03:31.410,"- It's not a one-to-one."
00:03:31.410,00:03:32.880,"Because they're far cheaper"
00:03:32.880,00:03:35.430,"and easier to make than any other kind of night vision,"
00:03:35.430,00:03:37.050,"active illumination is what's used"
00:03:37.050,00:03:39.240,"in almost all commercial night vision goggles"
00:03:39.240,00:03:41.163,"or nighttime security cameras."
00:03:42.240,00:03:44.190,"These were the first night vision goggles I wore"
00:03:44.190,00:03:46.923,"to attempt to drive in pure darkness."
00:03:48.470,00:03:51.180,"I have no idea where the focus is."
00:03:51.180,00:03:52.773,"If you could see this,"
00:03:53.850,00:03:55.173,"you would be terrified."
00:03:56.760,00:03:57.960,"I'm looking out at the road,"
00:03:57.960,00:04:01.290,"and I have the focus set to the first cone."
00:04:01.290,00:04:05.940,"Oh my goodness, this is not advisable."
00:04:05.940,00:04:07.890,"I have no idea how fast we're going."
00:04:07.890,00:04:11.370,"The problem with these goggles is it feels very zoomed in."
00:04:11.370,00:04:12.540,"It is bouncing,"
00:04:12.540,00:04:15.210,"and it's not really bouncing in time with anything."
00:04:15.210,00:04:16.950,"It is just like, bouncing."
00:04:16.950,00:04:19.684,"If we hit a parked car right now, I would not be surprised."
00:04:19.684,00:04:20.517,"- Oh God."
00:04:21.420,00:04:23.400,"- Okay, straight. Straighten it out."
00:04:23.400,00:04:24.870,"- Straight, straight. - Straight?"
00:04:24.870,00:04:25.703,"- Straighten it out."
00:04:25.703,00:04:27.930,"- Ben has military night vision goggles on,"
00:04:27.930,00:04:29.858,"so he can actually see where we're going."
00:04:29.858,00:04:31.320,"- More to the left, more to the left. Yep."
00:04:31.320,00:04:32.790,"And we're probably good."
00:04:32.790,00:04:34.503,"- Oh!"
00:04:37.050,00:04:39.210,"If I hadn't been directed from behind,"
00:04:39.210,00:04:41.610,"we would've crashed so many times."
00:04:41.610,00:04:44.370,"I also feel a little bit sick. So there's that."
00:04:44.370,00:04:47.130,"This is one of the big drawbacks of active illumination."
00:04:47.130,00:04:50.160,"There's a significant delay between what the camera sees"
00:04:50.160,00:04:52.320,"and what's displayed on screen."
00:04:52.320,00:04:53.580,"- For most digital systems,"
00:04:53.580,00:04:56.100,"the fastest you could ever get is the frame rate."
00:04:56.100,00:04:58.230,"So if it's 24 frames per second,"
00:04:58.230,00:05:00.060,"the fastest you could be in the delay"
00:05:00.060,00:05:02.310,"is about 1/24 of a second."
00:05:02.310,00:05:03.660,"Tens of milliseconds, maybe."
00:05:04.530,00:05:07.050,"- That's enough to make people get motion sickness"
00:05:07.050,00:05:08.643,"and lose their coordination."
00:05:09.540,00:05:11.755,"Oh boy. Do you wanna throw me a Frisbee?"
00:05:11.755,00:05:15.304,"(mischievous music)"
00:05:15.304,00:05:16.203,"(Frisbee scraping)"
00:05:16.203,00:05:19.052,"- (laughs) You don't even move."
00:05:19.052,00:05:20.437,"- I can't see anything."
00:05:20.437,00:05:22.823,"(mischievous music)"
00:05:22.823,00:05:24.014,"(Frisbee scraping)"
00:05:24.014,00:05:25.260,"(Emily laughs)"
00:05:25.260,00:05:27.510,"I think I'm gonna have to take these off shortly."
00:05:27.510,00:05:29.850,"There is crazy rolling shutter,"
00:05:29.850,00:05:32.400,"and just everything's jiggling around in front of me."
00:05:32.400,00:05:34.350,"Another drawback of active illumination"
00:05:34.350,00:05:36.090,"is that your range limited,"
00:05:36.090,00:05:39.303,"since you can only see as far as the light shines."
00:05:40.350,00:05:42.120,"But the main reason you can't use these"
00:05:42.120,00:05:43.890,"in the military is simple."
00:05:43.890,00:05:45.330,"They aren't passive."
00:05:45.330,00:05:47.820,"There's a bright beacon of near-infrared light,"
00:05:47.820,00:05:50.460,"so enemies can easily spot you."
00:05:50.460,00:05:52.530,"In fact, military night vision goggles are"
00:05:52.530,00:05:54.210,"a totally different technology."
00:05:54.210,00:05:56.700,"But they can still see in the near infrared."
00:05:56.700,00:05:58.350,"And this is why we've been filming through them"
00:05:58.350,00:06:00.840,"to capture the light from the active illuminators."
00:06:00.840,00:06:03.930,"Have you ever been out at night with night vision goggles"
00:06:03.930,00:06:05.310,"and sort of spotted someone"
00:06:05.310,00:06:08.220,"who's got like, an active illumination device?"
00:06:08.220,00:06:09.235,"- Yeah, no comment on that one."
00:06:09.235,00:06:11.700,"- (laughs) Fair enough."
00:06:11.700,00:06:14.760,"Military night vision goggles need to be far more concealed,"
00:06:14.760,00:06:17.100,"so they don't use active illuminators."
00:06:17.100,00:06:19.140,"Instead, they rely exclusively"
00:06:19.140,00:06:21.120,"on the second type of night vision:"
00:06:21.120,00:06:22.650,"image intensification."
00:06:22.650,00:06:25.410,"So should we try good goggles now?"
00:06:25.410,00:06:29.013,"Oh my goodness. It is literally like night and day."
00:06:30.570,00:06:31.897,"All right, let's do this."
00:06:31.897,00:06:33.090,"(exhilarating music)"
00:06:33.090,00:06:35.640,"- Oh, he's off with so much confidence."
00:06:35.640,00:06:37.020,"- Because I can see. - Oh my god."
00:06:37.020,00:06:39.210,"- I'm going straight for the cone."
00:06:39.210,00:06:41.580,"I'm gonna go to the left of this cone,"
00:06:41.580,00:06:43.611,"then I'm gonna go in between them."
00:06:43.611,00:06:45.963,"Oh, yes."
00:06:45.963,00:06:47.013,"- Whoa."
00:06:47.013,00:06:48.903,"- It's just like driving in the day."
00:06:50.040,00:06:54.150,"This technology uses only the existing light from a scene."
00:06:54.150,00:06:57.780,"When photons enter goggles, like these PVS-31As,"
00:06:57.780,00:06:59.520,"they get physically amplified"
00:06:59.520,00:07:01.890,"so that way more photons come out the other end"
00:07:01.890,00:07:03.210,"to reach your eyes."
00:07:03.210,00:07:06.240,"And in terms of like, how much brighter it makes the light,"
00:07:06.240,00:07:07.650,"can you comment on that?"
00:07:07.650,00:07:08.940,"- Yeah, it's definitely at least"
00:07:08.940,00:07:10.230,"on the order of thousands."
00:07:10.230,00:07:11.280,"- Thousands of times brighter."
00:07:11.280,00:07:12.113,"- Yeah."
00:07:12.113,00:07:12.946,"- And they're very light,"
00:07:12.946,00:07:15.390,"so people can wear them for more than 10 hours straight."
00:07:15.390,00:07:18.330,"All powered by a single AA battery."
00:07:18.330,00:07:20.700,"Driving the vehicle now was super easy."
00:07:20.700,00:07:23.640,"So easy that I got a little bit overconfident."
00:07:23.640,00:07:25.620,"- Maybe a little slower on the corner."
00:07:25.620,00:07:27.090,"- Okay."
00:07:27.090,00:07:30.420,"And since the goggles don't use a camera or display,"
00:07:30.420,00:07:32.910,"there's almost no delay in what you see."
00:07:32.910,00:07:34.500,"So you can shake the goggles,"
00:07:34.500,00:07:36.360,"and the world just moves with you."
00:07:36.360,00:07:39.840,"- The time from light in to light back out is very short."
00:07:39.840,00:07:42.690,"You can get down to microsecond levels, maybe even quicker."
00:07:42.690,00:07:44.550,"Nanosecond levels."
00:07:44.550,00:07:46.947,"- It's as if there are no goggles there at all."
00:07:46.947,00:07:48.750,"No, I can see so incredibly well."
00:07:48.750,00:07:51.600,"Let me compare to like, no night vision."
00:07:51.600,00:07:53.100,"Oh my goodness."
00:07:53.100,00:07:56.430,"Man, the world looks so much better through these goggles."
00:07:56.430,00:07:59.781,"This is when we found an unexpected benefit of night vision."
00:07:59.781,00:08:01.590,"(delicate ethereal music)"
00:08:01.590,00:08:03.393,"The stars are phenomenal."
00:08:04.950,00:08:07.290,"Through the goggles, starlight gets amplified enough"
00:08:07.290,00:08:09.900,"to light your entire environment."
00:08:09.900,00:08:12.690,"This also means that the entire night sky gets revealed"
00:08:12.690,00:08:14.043,"in its full glory."
00:08:15.300,00:08:17.520,"Emily, you are gonna have your mind blown"
00:08:17.520,00:08:18.870,"when you see through these."
00:08:19.740,00:08:22.983,"- Oh my god. You can see like, so many satellites."
00:08:23.820,00:08:26.763,"Oh, and you can see the Milky Way so clearly."
00:08:28.710,00:08:30.663,"Okay. Yeah, I can drive with this."
00:08:32.400,00:08:35.133,"Oh my god, this stretch is gorgeous."
00:08:36.330,00:08:38.790,"And it all looks like you're driving in snow."
00:08:38.790,00:08:41.640,"Like, everything is sparkly and white. It's so fun."
00:08:41.640,00:08:43.653,"Honestly, I find it really relaxing."
00:08:44.640,00:08:45.810,"- The one problem I noticed is"
00:08:45.810,00:08:47.430,"that these night vision goggles have"
00:08:47.430,00:08:49.110,"a limited field of view."
00:08:49.110,00:08:50.370,"You got no peripheral, really."
00:08:50.370,00:08:51.690,"- None, none."
00:08:51.690,00:08:54.480,"I think I can, like, right now with my hands,"
00:08:54.480,00:08:56.250,"I can get up to like, this far."
00:08:56.250,00:08:58.620,"- But the Navy have one set of goggles even better"
00:08:58.620,00:09:00.036,"than the ones we've been using."
00:09:00.036,00:09:01.230,"(mysterious music)"
00:09:01.230,00:09:04.170,"These are the GPNVG-18s."
00:09:04.170,00:09:06.270,"They also use image intensification,"
00:09:06.270,00:09:08.430,"but now it's applied to four tubes"
00:09:08.430,00:09:10.020,"to fill your field of view."
00:09:10.020,00:09:12.690,"- The way this optic is combining the four tubes,"
00:09:12.690,00:09:16.110,"it's combining it into one sort of ellipse"
00:09:16.110,00:09:17.580,"into your eye so that you can look"
00:09:17.580,00:09:18.810,"with your eye side to side,"
00:09:18.810,00:09:20.070,"without having to move your head."
00:09:20.070,00:09:22.860,"- They're the most expensive NVGs in the world."
00:09:22.860,00:09:26.670,"They retail for over $40,000 online."
00:09:26.670,00:09:27.810,"They're also the same goggles"
00:09:27.810,00:09:29.820,"which were used in the SEAL Team Six raid"
00:09:29.820,00:09:31.893,"on Osama bin Laden in 2011."
00:09:32.882,00:09:35.520,"(engine roaring)"
00:09:35.520,00:09:36.540,"That's amazing."
00:09:36.540,00:09:39.090,"Yeah, I'd be happy to do anything in these goggles."
00:09:41.280,00:09:42.113,"Yes!"
00:09:43.080,00:09:46.290,"It just makes you so much more confident to be able to see."
00:09:46.290,00:09:48.330,"The last thing that makes these military goggles feel"
00:09:48.330,00:09:51.360,"so natural is their incredible resolution."
00:09:51.360,00:09:53.130,"- When we characterize a night vision tube,"
00:09:53.130,00:09:54.990,"we don't think about it in terms of pixels"
00:09:54.990,00:09:56.760,"or resolution in that sense."
00:09:56.760,00:09:59.550,"We think about it in terms of line pairs per millimeter."
00:09:59.550,00:10:02.850,"So how many line pairs can you resolve"
00:10:02.850,00:10:05.460,"within one millimeter of physical space?"
00:10:05.460,00:10:07.920,"- For a pair of night vision goggles to be military grade,"
00:10:07.920,00:10:09.000,"they need to be able to resolve"
00:10:09.000,00:10:11.820,"at least 64 line pairs per millimeter."
00:10:11.820,00:10:13.980,"- So there's a almost qualitative-like,"
00:10:13.980,00:10:16.290,"but very skilled and historic process"
00:10:16.290,00:10:18.660,"for how these are quantified for their performance."
00:10:18.660,00:10:20.253,"- Is it like years of training, or is it..."
00:10:20.253,00:10:22.867,"- I'd say within six months we could have somebody"
00:10:22.867,00:10:23.853,"up to speed. - Wow."
00:10:23.853,00:10:25.950,"- For this I'm gonna go completely dark."
00:10:25.950,00:10:27.990,"- Okay, there's a bright chart right in there."
00:10:27.990,00:10:31.143,"It says plus two on one side. Does it say that?"
00:10:32.010,00:10:34.470,"- Maybe can't say what it really says."
00:10:34.470,00:10:37.680,"- Okay. I won't say what it really says."
00:10:37.680,00:10:39.840,"- We ran into this issue a lot."
00:10:39.840,00:10:41.820,"- Oh, I can't really answer that."
00:10:41.820,00:10:42.850,"Yeah, no comment on that one."
00:10:42.850,00:10:43.683,"(Derek laughs)"
00:10:43.683,00:10:44.610,"I cannot comment on that."
00:10:44.610,00:10:47.760,"So the process to make the microchannel plate"
00:10:47.760,00:10:50.250,"and the photocathode,"
00:10:50.250,00:10:51.528,"yeah, we can't talk about that, either."
00:10:51.528,00:10:54.420,"- (laughs) So much about the night vision goggles"
00:10:54.420,00:10:57.300,"is a secret, since they're still cutting edge."
00:10:57.300,00:10:59.190,"This video is the absolute limit"
00:10:59.190,00:11:01.200,"of what the Navy is willing to reveal publicly"
00:11:01.200,00:11:02.880,"about their night vision."
00:11:02.880,00:11:05.220,"Though we're not allowed to show the exact bar test,"
00:11:05.220,00:11:07.680,"we can show these."
00:11:07.680,00:11:09.540,"- You see similar bars that we had"
00:11:09.540,00:11:12.330,"in the night vision are out here, through the trees."
00:11:12.330,00:11:13.260,"And then we've got,"
00:11:13.260,00:11:14.850,"if we maybe go towards this other corner,"
00:11:14.850,00:11:16.620,"you could see at different distances."
00:11:16.620,00:11:18.000,"And the bigger the optic gets,"
00:11:18.000,00:11:19.380,"the farther away you can see."
00:11:19.380,00:11:22.770,"And so you need farther and farther away calibration targets"
00:11:22.770,00:11:24.417,"to understand the resolution"
00:11:24.417,00:11:26.340,"and the quality of those images."
00:11:26.340,00:11:29.280,"We do a lot of lab characterization and modeling to predict"
00:11:29.280,00:11:30.930,"how far it'll be able to see,"
00:11:30.930,00:11:34.440,"but the ultimate test is to come out into the real world."
00:11:34.440,00:11:36.150,"- We use line pairs per millimeter"
00:11:36.150,00:11:38.010,"to describe the goggles' resolution"
00:11:38.010,00:11:41.970,"because image intensification is analog, not digital."
00:11:41.970,00:11:44.100,"This is the secret to how they emulate"
00:11:44.100,00:11:46.230,"our normal vision so well."
00:11:46.230,00:11:48.240,"Digital cameras have refresh rates"
00:11:48.240,00:11:50.490,"and resolution limits to worry about"
00:11:50.490,00:11:52.140,"because they're converting photons"
00:11:52.140,00:11:54.600,"into discrete values on pixels."
00:11:54.600,00:11:57.000,"But image intensifiers are a continuous,"
00:11:57.000,00:12:00.390,"real-time, one-to-one way to amplify light."
00:12:00.390,00:12:02.670,"This is how it works."
00:12:02.670,00:12:03.870,"In a dark scene,"
00:12:03.870,00:12:07.200,"limited light from things like stars reflect off the scene"
00:12:07.200,00:12:08.250,"and sends some photons"
00:12:08.250,00:12:10.740,"toward the image intensification tube."
00:12:10.740,00:12:13.590,"The lens focuses these photons onto the tube"
00:12:13.590,00:12:17.520,"as an upside-down image, where they go through three steps."
00:12:17.520,00:12:20.850,"First, the photon hits a thin plate called a photocathode,"
00:12:20.850,00:12:24.090,"made from semiconductors or alkaline metals."
00:12:24.090,00:12:25.770,"When a photon hits the plate,"
00:12:25.770,00:12:28.470,"an electron in that part of the plate gets excited"
00:12:28.470,00:12:30.930,"and is ejected into the vacuum."
00:12:30.930,00:12:32.910,"Next, the electrons are accelerated"
00:12:32.910,00:12:35.340,"through the vacuum tube by a voltage."
00:12:35.340,00:12:37.350,"They head straight into another thin plate,"
00:12:37.350,00:12:39.060,"called the microchannel plate,"
00:12:39.060,00:12:42.780,"and this is made from insulating material, often glass,"
00:12:42.780,00:12:46.380,"with about 6 million tiny channels in it."
00:12:46.380,00:12:48.870,"These are all angled at about five degrees"
00:12:48.870,00:12:52.440,"to get incoming electrons to collide with the channel walls."
00:12:52.440,00:12:53.340,"When they do,"
00:12:53.340,00:12:55.980,"they release more electrons from the wall material,"
00:12:55.980,00:12:58.080,"which collide even more with the walls,"
00:12:58.080,00:13:01.920,"releasing more electrons, creating an electron avalanche."
00:13:01.920,00:13:03.960,"So a few electrons go in,"
00:13:03.960,00:13:06.630,"and a flood of thousands come out."
00:13:06.630,00:13:09.330,"Then this flood of electrons leaves each channel"
00:13:09.330,00:13:11.280,"and gets accelerated in a straight line"
00:13:11.280,00:13:14.490,"by another high voltage to hit a phosphorous screen."
00:13:14.490,00:13:16.110,"This is just a screen made of material"
00:13:16.110,00:13:18.330,"that glows when exposed to radiation."
00:13:18.330,00:13:20.430,"So it converts the electron kinetic energy"
00:13:20.430,00:13:23.580,"back into visible photons for you to see."
00:13:23.580,00:13:24.450,"So every photon"
00:13:24.450,00:13:27.300,"that enters the tube gets multiplied thousands of times over"
00:13:27.300,00:13:28.950,"while maintaining its position,"
00:13:28.950,00:13:32.370,"which makes for a brighter but otherwise identical image."
00:13:32.370,00:13:33.390,"As a last step,"
00:13:33.390,00:13:35.910,"there are 20 million optical fibers attached"
00:13:35.910,00:13:39.578,"to the phosphorus screen that twist the image right side up."
00:13:39.578,00:13:41.340,"(soft music)"
00:13:41.340,00:13:43.020,"- The photocathode, the microchannel plate,"
00:13:43.020,00:13:44.640,"that vacuum gap, the phosphorus screen,"
00:13:44.640,00:13:46.560,"is all in this first section."
00:13:46.560,00:13:47.970,"About the width of my fingernail."
00:13:47.970,00:13:50.700,"The rest of this space is the fiber optic twist."
00:13:50.700,00:13:52.050,"- Oh wow."
00:13:52.050,00:13:55.470,"For decades, the phosphorus screen was always green."
00:13:55.470,00:13:58.470,"It's this historic phosphor choice that's responsible"
00:13:58.470,00:14:00.480,"for all the classic green night vision we know"
00:14:00.480,00:14:02.223,"from movies or video games."
00:14:03.510,00:14:06.510,"But in dark conditions the human eye doesn't see best"
00:14:06.510,00:14:08.310,"in the green part of the spectrum."
00:14:08.310,00:14:10.770,"There are two types of photoreceptors on your retina:"
00:14:10.770,00:14:12.570,"rods and cones."
00:14:12.570,00:14:14.550,"Cones are better for well-lit vision,"
00:14:14.550,00:14:16.410,"and they're good at distinguishing color."
00:14:16.410,00:14:18.960,"They're located in the center of your retina."
00:14:18.960,00:14:20.880,"Rods are better for low-light vision,"
00:14:20.880,00:14:23.550,"and they're located at the edges of your retina."
00:14:23.550,00:14:25.890,"This is why you can sometimes see dim stars"
00:14:25.890,00:14:27.150,"out of the corner of your eye,"
00:14:27.150,00:14:30.450,"but they disappear if you look straight at them."
00:14:30.450,00:14:32.310,"The light sensitivity of rods peaks"
00:14:32.310,00:14:34.200,"in the blue part of the visible spectrum."
00:14:34.200,00:14:37.560,"So that's why our PVS-31As look like this."
00:14:37.560,00:14:39.840,"They've been upgraded to white phosphor,"
00:14:39.840,00:14:42.060,"which looks slightly blue overall,"
00:14:42.060,00:14:44.433,"making it easier for people to make out."
00:14:45.420,00:14:48.660,"To see how well these night vision goggles amplify light,"
00:14:48.660,00:14:50.430,"we put them in a well-lit room"
00:14:50.430,00:14:52.200,"and covered them up entirely,"
00:14:52.200,00:14:54.660,"except for a little thumbtack hole."
00:14:54.660,00:14:57.480,"This lets in only a tiny bit of light."
00:14:57.480,00:14:58.860,"But the view through the goggles"
00:14:58.860,00:15:01.440,"is still brighter than the room itself."
00:15:01.440,00:15:03.150,"We couldn't expose the night vision goggles"
00:15:03.150,00:15:04.530,"to any more light than this,"
00:15:04.530,00:15:06.420,"but not because of anything like the movies,"
00:15:06.420,00:15:07.860,"where bright light is enough"
00:15:07.860,00:15:10.980,"to incapacitate people in night vision goggles."
00:15:10.980,00:15:12.930,"- So what would happen if we just turned on the lights"
00:15:12.930,00:15:13.763,"without the cap?"
00:15:13.763,00:15:15.120,"Would this just turn white?"
00:15:15.120,00:15:16.080,"- It would still function,"
00:15:16.080,00:15:17.550,"but you wouldn't want to do that"
00:15:17.550,00:15:18.720,"for a very long period of time."
00:15:18.720,00:15:20.040,"It's got a current limiter"
00:15:20.040,00:15:22.950,"in how much charge can be absorbed by the screen,"
00:15:22.950,00:15:25.320,"and increasing the light intensity saturates"
00:15:25.320,00:15:27.270,"that component of the circuit."
00:15:27.270,00:15:29.700,"- But what happens if we push image intensification"
00:15:29.700,00:15:31.320,"to its opposite limit,"
00:15:31.320,00:15:34.263,"by using the goggles in a room with no light at all?"
00:15:35.670,00:15:38.070,"If you want to test night vision goggles,"
00:15:38.070,00:15:38.910,"you gotta go to the place"
00:15:38.910,00:15:41.850,"where it is absolutely pitch dark,"
00:15:41.850,00:15:46.080,"underground, all sealed off, basically no photons."
00:15:46.080,00:15:48.210,"It's gonna be completely disorienting."
00:15:48.210,00:15:50.430,"- So we're in an underground range here"
00:15:50.430,00:15:52.110,"at the Navy base, Crane."
00:15:52.110,00:15:56.190,"And this place is usually used to test small arms weapons,"
00:15:56.190,00:15:59.970,"but we can also seal it up and make it very dark,"
00:15:59.970,00:16:00.990,"all the way down to"
00:16:00.990,00:16:03.990,"where there's almost no visible light whatsoever."
00:16:03.990,00:16:07.020,"- So there's basically zero light in here,"
00:16:07.020,00:16:08.087,"almost no photons."
00:16:08.087,00:16:09.960,"- In the visible. That's right."
00:16:09.960,00:16:12.270,"- We are now going to turn off all the lights,"
00:16:12.270,00:16:14.880,"make it completely pitch black in here,"
00:16:14.880,00:16:18.930,"but on top of that, the range is full of smoke."
00:16:18.930,00:16:20.820,"So even with night vision goggles,"
00:16:20.820,00:16:23.460,"we might have no luck at all."
00:16:23.460,00:16:25.620,"If you are in pure darkness for a long period of time,"
00:16:25.620,00:16:27.270,"what happens?"
00:16:27.270,00:16:28.920,"- You start to feel a little strange."
00:16:28.920,00:16:30.450,"Kind of like being in an anechoic chamber,"
00:16:30.450,00:16:31.950,"where you can't hear things."
00:16:31.950,00:16:34.740,"The lack of sensory perception can sometimes start"
00:16:34.740,00:16:39.000,"to give a little bit of vertigo or uneasy feeling to some."
00:16:39.000,00:16:40.380,"- Okay."
00:16:40.380,00:16:42.210,"- Three, two, one."
00:16:43.470,00:16:44.613,"- Pitch darkness."
00:16:46.110,00:16:47.553,"Okay, my night vision's on."
00:16:48.660,00:16:51.540,"- Wow, I actually can't see anything through these."
00:16:51.540,00:16:54.000,"- With PBS-31As in pure darkness,"
00:16:54.000,00:16:58.200,"you mainly just see their analog processing in effect."
00:16:58.200,00:17:00.090,"- Oh my god, it just looks like a blizzard."
00:17:00.090,00:17:04.410,"- When I look that way, I see almost nothing."
00:17:04.410,00:17:06.510,"I just get snow."
00:17:06.510,00:17:08.880,"All this noise comes from electrons getting pulled"
00:17:08.880,00:17:11.010,"through the goggles in two ways."
00:17:11.010,00:17:13.080,"One is thermionic emission."
00:17:13.080,00:17:14.550,"Just due to thermal energy,"
00:17:14.550,00:17:18.270,"some electrons will have enough energy to escape the metal."
00:17:18.270,00:17:20.850,"And the other is due to the electric field."
00:17:20.850,00:17:23.550,"There's such a strong electric field in that tube"
00:17:23.550,00:17:27.600,"that it'll pull some electrons off the photo cathode."
00:17:27.600,00:17:28.433,"Can you make out the face?"
00:17:28.433,00:17:29.370,"'Cause I mean,"
00:17:29.370,00:17:31.260,"there's a little bit of light coming out of the goggles,"
00:17:31.260,00:17:32.790,"which might hit my face."
00:17:32.790,00:17:34.200,"Because image intensification"
00:17:34.200,00:17:36.570,"can only amplify existing light,"
00:17:36.570,00:17:39.600,"its one limitation is that it requires a light source."
00:17:39.600,00:17:43.050,"It can be tiny, but there has to be something."
00:17:43.050,00:17:46.170,"If you're in absolute darkness,"
00:17:46.170,00:17:48.480,"even active illumination is a better bet."
00:17:48.480,00:17:50.220,"Now, this is advantageous"
00:17:50.220,00:17:53.400,"because if you're in a really black room,"
00:17:53.400,00:17:55.980,"then you do kind of need to light it a little bit."
00:17:55.980,00:17:59.400,"Unless you use the final type of night vision:"
00:17:59.400,00:18:00.393,"thermal imaging."
00:18:01.350,00:18:04.710,"With my naked eye, I can't make out the exit sign,"
00:18:04.710,00:18:06.813,"but with the goggles I know it's up there."
00:18:07.950,00:18:09.660,"While image intensification attempts"
00:18:09.660,00:18:11.280,"to match your normal vision,"
00:18:11.280,00:18:13.650,"thermal imaging goes beyond it."
00:18:13.650,00:18:15.720,"In the electromagnetic spectrum,"
00:18:15.720,00:18:18.270,"the infrared range has longer wavelengths"
00:18:18.270,00:18:19.860,"than the visible range."
00:18:19.860,00:18:21.270,"All the shorter wavelengths up"
00:18:21.270,00:18:24.330,"to mid-wave infrared light are reflective,"
00:18:24.330,00:18:27.210,"meaning that everyday objects don't emit these wavelengths"
00:18:27.210,00:18:28.043,"on their own."
00:18:28.043,00:18:29.550,"You need a light source."
00:18:29.550,00:18:32.610,"To see my shirt, we can't be in the dark."
00:18:32.610,00:18:35.880,"You need visible light to reflect the blue to your eyes."
00:18:35.880,00:18:38.130,"And that's why we needed the near-infrared lights"
00:18:38.130,00:18:40.590,"on the active illumination devices."
00:18:40.590,00:18:43.590,"But the long infrared range is actually emissive,"
00:18:43.590,00:18:46.410,"meaning that it doesn't need a light source at all."
00:18:46.410,00:18:49.650,"That's because all objects emit electromagnetic radiation,"
00:18:49.650,00:18:52.740,"and the shape of their spectra follows Planck's law."
00:18:52.740,00:18:55.050,"You can see that only extremely hot objects"
00:18:55.050,00:18:56.970,"like stars have significant emission"
00:18:56.970,00:18:59.130,"in the shorter wavelengths like visible light,"
00:18:59.130,00:19:02.343,"but virtually everything emits in the infrared."
00:19:03.960,00:19:05.730,"Because thermal imaging doesn't require"
00:19:05.730,00:19:08.400,"any external light, like image intensifiers do,"
00:19:08.400,00:19:10.350,"and it doesn't need to create its own light,"
00:19:10.350,00:19:11.970,"like active illuminators do,"
00:19:11.970,00:19:15.030,"it's undefeated in completely black situations"
00:19:15.030,00:19:16.980,"like the underground range."
00:19:16.980,00:19:18.270,"It's also the best choice"
00:19:18.270,00:19:21.450,"when there's fog or smoke obstructing your view."
00:19:21.450,00:19:25.320,"I am about to walk into the fog in this range,"
00:19:25.320,00:19:28.380,"and we'll see if I disappear in the visible,"
00:19:28.380,00:19:29.790,"and then you guys can look and see"
00:19:29.790,00:19:32.880,"if we can pick me up on the infrared cameras."
00:19:32.880,00:19:34.875,"- Yeah, I can't see you at all now."
00:19:34.875,00:19:37.875,"(mischievous music)"
00:19:43.560,00:19:45.210,"Derek's getting his full workout."
00:19:53.159,00:19:57.576,"- Whew. I had no idea we'd be so emissive down there."
00:19:58.470,00:20:01.710,"Thermal imaging also sees things your eyes never could,"
00:20:01.710,00:20:04.590,"like objects that have been buried underground"
00:20:04.590,00:20:07.323,"or recently touched by someone's hand."
00:20:09.660,00:20:11.490,"The last advantage of thermal imaging"
00:20:11.490,00:20:13.230,"is its unbeatable range,"
00:20:13.230,00:20:15.750,"even better than the military night vision goggles."
00:20:15.750,00:20:18.300,"We set up a distance test hundreds of meters away"
00:20:18.300,00:20:21.150,"from the tower to compare the infrared cameras"
00:20:21.150,00:20:23.250,"against the PVS-31As."
00:20:23.250,00:20:25.080,"To the naked eye on a moonless night,"
00:20:25.080,00:20:27.870,"this is what someone holding a cigarette lighter looks like"
00:20:27.870,00:20:29.670,"at that distance."
00:20:29.670,00:20:32.363,"This is how it looks through the night vision goggles."
00:20:33.540,00:20:37.113,"And this is how it looks through the infrared cameras."
00:20:38.190,00:20:41.010,"To get even more subtle and remove all direct light,"
00:20:41.010,00:20:43.200,"this is what a person checking their phone looks like"
00:20:43.200,00:20:44.580,"in those conditions."
00:20:44.580,00:20:46.593,"Totally invisible to the naked eye,"
00:20:47.580,00:20:49.410,"discernible through the night vision goggles,"
00:20:49.410,00:20:53.550,"and perfectly clear through the infrared cameras."
00:20:53.550,00:20:56.550,"But thermal imaging has its weaknesses as well."
00:20:56.550,00:20:58.080,"It's a digital system"
00:20:58.080,00:21:01.080,"with motion delays just like active illumination."
00:21:01.080,00:21:03.120,"Thermal imaging goggles aren't popular"
00:21:03.120,00:21:06.240,"because high-quality infrared cameras are too big"
00:21:06.240,00:21:08.223,"and too power hungry to be portable."
00:21:09.330,00:21:11.880,"And since they only detect thermal radiation,"
00:21:11.880,00:21:14.820,"they can't even see lettering on signs, for example."
00:21:14.820,00:21:16.890,"This is looking at it in the infrared."
00:21:16.890,00:21:21.890,"E, F, P, T, O, Z, L, P, E, D."
00:21:22.050,00:21:23.760,"Anything that is visible solely due"
00:21:23.760,00:21:25.500,"to the way light reflects off it"
00:21:25.500,00:21:27.600,"is invisible to thermal cameras."
00:21:27.600,00:21:31.440,"E, D, F, C. I don't know what that is."
00:21:31.440,00:21:34.525,"Z, F, or Z, P."
00:21:34.525,00:21:36.000,"(bell dinging)"
00:21:36.000,00:21:39.120,"Currently there is no one best type of night vision."
00:21:39.120,00:21:42.000,"They all have trade-offs between things like resolution,"
00:21:42.000,00:21:46.110,"delay, light situation, concealment, and portability."
00:21:46.110,00:21:48.870,"The entire history of night vision has been driven"
00:21:48.870,00:21:51.243,"by trying to minimize these trade-offs."
00:21:52.530,00:21:54.090,"The first night vision technology,"
00:21:54.090,00:21:55.260,"known as Gen 0,"
00:21:55.260,00:21:58.230,"was developed for sniper scopes during World War II"
00:21:58.230,00:21:59.670,"and the Korean War."
00:21:59.670,00:22:02.310,"They used active infrared illumination,"
00:22:02.310,00:22:05.280,"much like the commercial night vision goggles of today."
00:22:05.280,00:22:08.670,"Then Gen 1 night vision was developed for the Vietnam War."
00:22:08.670,00:22:11.340,"These used basic image intensifier tubes"
00:22:11.340,00:22:13.560,"with just a photo cathode and screen."
00:22:13.560,00:22:15.600,"No microchannel plate."
00:22:15.600,00:22:17.550,"They stacked three of them together in a row,"
00:22:17.550,00:22:21.030,"making them extremely bulky and distorted to look through."
00:22:21.030,00:22:23.010,"But the resulting scopes were sensitive enough"
00:22:23.010,00:22:25.920,"to operate just off light from the Moon and stars,"
00:22:25.920,00:22:28.260,"giving them the nickname Starlight."
00:22:28.260,00:22:31.080,"Gen 2 night vision was developed in the '60s and '70s"
00:22:31.080,00:22:32.550,"and added the microchannel plate"
00:22:32.550,00:22:34.410,"to the image intensifier tube,"
00:22:34.410,00:22:36.780,"increasing sensitivity so that they could be used"
00:22:36.780,00:22:40.470,"in dark conditions, like on cloudy or moonless nights."
00:22:40.470,00:22:43.800,"This addition also made the tubes much more compact,"
00:22:43.800,00:22:46.440,"allowing the first sets of handheld night vision goggles"
00:22:46.440,00:22:47.373,"to be created."
00:22:48.300,00:22:50.010,"The last generation, Gen 3,"
00:22:50.010,00:22:52.470,"became available in the late '80s."
00:22:52.470,00:22:54.570,"These changed the photocathode material"
00:22:54.570,00:22:56.670,"into the semiconductor gallium arsenide"
00:22:56.670,00:22:59.670,"in order to better convert photons to electrons."
00:22:59.670,00:23:01.590,"They also coated the microchannel plate"
00:23:01.590,00:23:04.500,"with an ion barrier film to increase the life"
00:23:04.500,00:23:08.490,"of the tube from 3,000 to 10,000 hours."
00:23:08.490,00:23:10.860,"Though there hasn't been an official new generation"
00:23:10.860,00:23:13.080,"of night vision goggles in over 30 years,"
00:23:13.080,00:23:16.680,"researchers are constantly working on new improvements."
00:23:16.680,00:23:19.440,"- Some of the basic research aspects"
00:23:19.440,00:23:21.690,"that I can talk about are looking at"
00:23:21.690,00:23:26.130,"how to extend the infrared regime"
00:23:26.130,00:23:28.560,"of the detectors overall."
00:23:28.560,00:23:31.770,"Looking at areas to have devices"
00:23:31.770,00:23:33.690,"that can see farther into the infrared"
00:23:33.690,00:23:36.000,"with less noise than what we can today."
00:23:36.000,00:23:38.640,"- How did you get into night vision goggles?"
00:23:38.640,00:23:41.490,"- I was in the Marine Corps in infantry in early 2000s,"
00:23:41.490,00:23:43.470,"and we still used a similar model"
00:23:43.470,00:23:46.590,"as this one right here in Operation Iraqi Freedom."
00:23:46.590,00:23:48.420,"That was one of the actually driving factors"
00:23:48.420,00:23:49.590,"of why I got into this field."
00:23:49.590,00:23:51.840,"I was using things like this"
00:23:51.840,00:23:53.610,"that were good, but not great."
00:23:53.610,00:23:54.750,"You know, they could have been better."
00:23:54.750,00:23:56.310,"We were also using infrared systems"
00:23:56.310,00:23:58.800,"that were not good at all."
00:23:58.800,00:24:02.250,"And so kind of using those in the field"
00:24:02.250,00:24:04.530,"and feeling like, you know,"
00:24:04.530,00:24:06.509,"asking that question to yourself,"
00:24:06.509,00:24:08.250,"why is it not better?"
00:24:08.250,00:24:09.960,"- And the value of night vision extends"
00:24:09.960,00:24:12.000,"far beyond the military."
00:24:12.000,00:24:14.460,"What sort of applications would people use"
00:24:14.460,00:24:15.630,"these goggles for?"
00:24:15.630,00:24:18.810,"- Search and rescue or places where maybe there's not power."
00:24:18.810,00:24:20.127,"It's too dark to see,"
00:24:20.127,00:24:22.680,"and you wanna be able to do things quickly."
00:24:22.680,00:24:25.800,"- Thermal imaging has grown to become an entire industry,"
00:24:25.800,00:24:27.840,"with infrared cameras used in everything"
00:24:27.840,00:24:30.390,"from firefighting to building inspections,"
00:24:30.390,00:24:32.430,"to medical imaging."
00:24:32.430,00:24:34.590,"And the microchannel plate first developed"
00:24:34.590,00:24:37.950,"for night vision now sits aboard space telescopes,"
00:24:37.950,00:24:40.230,"like the Chandra X-ray Observatory,"
00:24:40.230,00:24:42.420,"helping us discover the hidden world"
00:24:42.420,00:24:45.240,"beyond what is simply visible by eye."
00:24:45.240,00:24:46.980,"- Wow, that's beautiful."
00:24:46.980,00:24:50.103,"I'm like, there are like, tears in my eyes."
00:24:51.360,00:24:53.520,"Okay, I'm good. (laughs)"
00:24:53.520,00:24:55.350,"I feel like no one can see me 'cause it's in the dark,"
00:24:55.350,00:24:57.630,"but you probably can, if you have night vision on."
00:24:57.630,00:25:01.320,"(gentle piano music)"

00:25:06.930,00:25:10.170,"- Testing this night vision technology perfectly illustrates"
00:25:10.170,00:25:13.260,"how there is no substitute for hands-on exploration"
00:25:13.260,00:25:15.780,"to truly appreciate new innovations."
00:25:15.780,00:25:17.040,"But you don't have to go all the way"
00:25:17.040,00:25:20.760,"to a military base to get hands-on with cutting edge tech."
