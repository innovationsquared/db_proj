00:00:00.239,00:00:03.406,"(shade balls rolling)"
00:00:04.290,00:00:06.880,"- These are shade balls."
00:00:06.880,00:00:09.130,"They're being dumped into this water reservoir"
00:00:09.130,00:00:10.910,"in Los Angeles."
00:00:10.910,00:00:13.010,"And contrary to what you may have heard,"
00:00:13.010,00:00:16.633,"their main purpose is not to reduce evaporation."
00:00:17.730,00:00:20.170,"So what are they really for?"
00:00:20.170,00:00:23.000,"To find out, I'm visiting the largest collection"
00:00:23.000,00:00:24.821,"of these balls anywhere on earth,"
00:00:24.821,00:00:25.654,"What?"
00:00:25.654,00:00:26.487,"at LA Reservoir."
00:00:27.490,00:00:30.240,"(tranquil music)"
00:00:32.650,00:00:34.550,"96 million shade balls."
00:00:34.550,00:00:35.483,"- [Man 1] That's correct."
00:00:35.483,00:00:36.780,"(laughing)"
00:00:36.780,00:00:38.063,"- 96 million."
00:00:39.120,00:00:41.517,"It's very rare to for you to see 96 million of anything."
00:00:41.517,00:00:42.350,"- [Man 1] Yeah."
00:00:42.350,00:00:43.183,"(laughing)"
00:00:43.183,00:00:45.460,"- This is your life vest which you are required to wear."
00:00:45.460,00:00:46.370,"- All right."
00:00:46.370,00:00:49.303,"- Throw a leg over and climb on in any way you can."
00:00:49.303,00:00:51.374,"(tranquil music)"
00:00:51.374,00:00:52.207,"There you go."
00:00:52.207,00:00:54.020,"- [Narrator] Thank you."
00:00:54.020,00:00:57.280,"Looking at this, I had so many questions."
00:00:57.280,00:00:59.110,"Like, why are they black?"
00:00:59.110,00:01:01.740,"Are they safe to have in drinking water?"
00:01:01.740,00:01:03.400,"How much do they cost?"
00:01:03.400,00:01:05.735,"Do they actually reduce evaporation?"
00:01:05.735,00:01:09.203,"And, what is their real purpose?"
00:01:09.203,00:01:12.970,"(boat engine roaring)"
00:01:12.970,00:01:14.560,"Is that hard to drive in shade balls?"
00:01:14.560,00:01:15.570,"- It is very hard."
00:01:15.570,00:01:16.765,"- Why is that?"
00:01:16.765,00:01:18.017,"- 'Cause..."
00:01:18.017,00:01:19.850,"(boat engine drowns James voice)"
00:01:19.850,00:01:22.500,"- These are actually partially filled with water,"
00:01:22.500,00:01:24.810,"and the reason they are filled with water is that,"
00:01:24.810,00:01:26.930,"at LA Reservoir we have some really high winds"
00:01:26.930,00:01:29.660,"and so, you know, if we didn't put water into these things,"
00:01:29.660,00:01:31.750,"there would be balls down bouncing on the 5 Freeway,"
00:01:31.750,00:01:33.630,"people drive down, they'd be all over the place."
00:01:33.630,00:01:36.210,"So, these keep the balls in the reservoir"
00:01:36.210,00:01:37.590,"and if they do start to roll,"
00:01:37.590,00:01:40.120,"they kind of wobble because the water makes them uneven."
00:01:40.120,00:01:41.770,"- [Narrator] But that makes them significantly"
00:01:41.770,00:01:43.740,"more difficult to push out of the way."
00:01:43.740,00:01:46.070,"Especially, when they form close packed"
00:01:46.070,00:01:48.280,"crystal-like structures."
00:01:48.280,00:01:50.880,"Behind the boat, the balls quickly come together"
00:01:50.880,00:01:52.470,"in our wake."
00:01:52.470,00:01:56.474,"And some close to the motor are pulled along with the boat."
00:01:56.474,00:01:59.724,"(boat engine stopping)"
00:02:01.950,00:02:02.783,"Wow!"
00:02:04.786,00:02:07.459,"(wind blowing)"
00:02:07.459,00:02:08.540,"(laughing)"
00:02:08.540,00:02:11.550,"What did you think, the first time they suggested"
00:02:11.550,00:02:13.683,"doing this or when it first came in?"
00:02:14.670,00:02:16.890,"- Yeah, it was a little out there."
00:02:16.890,00:02:18.210,"- [Narrator] Did you think they were nuts?"
00:02:18.210,00:02:20.294,"- No, not nuts."
00:02:20.294,00:02:22.710,"- [Narrator] Well, it just, it like looks absurd."
00:02:22.710,00:02:25.000,"It's like we're in the world's biggest ball pit."
00:02:25.000,00:02:26.170,"- Right, yeah, that's what it looks like."
00:02:26.170,00:02:28.110,"Yeah, you can't tell by standing here"
00:02:28.110,00:02:29.950,"that we are actually floating"
00:02:29.950,00:02:32.394,"over, I think it's probably,"
00:02:32.394,00:02:37.030,"40 feet right here, 40, 50 feet deep below us,"
00:02:37.030,00:02:38.903,"and you can't even seen any water."
00:02:40.380,00:02:41.828,"You'd think it was a joke, right?"
00:02:41.828,00:02:42.750,"(laughing)"
00:02:42.750,00:02:44.087,"If you didn't know, you'd go like,"
00:02:44.087,00:02:45.260,"""No you're not, that's"
00:02:45.260,00:02:46.391,"(laughing)"
00:02:46.391,00:02:48.130,"a green screen or something, right?"
00:02:48.130,00:02:48.963,"Yeah, its fake."""
00:02:48.963,00:02:52.260,"- So like, when I switch on my tap at home,"
00:02:52.260,00:02:53.125,"is the water coming from here?"
00:02:53.125,00:02:54.375,"- [Hellen] Yes."
00:02:55.220,00:02:56.779,"- Sometimes or always?"
00:02:56.779,00:02:57.612,"- [Hellen] Yes, most of the time."
00:02:57.612,00:02:58.445,"- Most of the time?"
00:02:58.445,00:02:59.278,"- [Hellen] Yes."
00:02:59.278,00:03:00.111,"- Most of the time the water is coming from here."
00:03:00.111,00:03:00.944,"- [Hellen] Correct, yes."
00:03:00.944,00:03:01.777,"- Absolutely nuts."
00:03:01.777,00:03:05.600,"So why is LA Reservoir covered in shade balls?"
00:03:05.600,00:03:08.220,"Well, the the problem all started with Bromide."
00:03:08.220,00:03:10.840,"- Bromide is a naturally occurring substance."
00:03:10.840,00:03:12.820,"It's associated with salt water"
00:03:12.820,00:03:16.870,"and so normally places like California Aqueduct,"
00:03:16.870,00:03:18.540,"that comes down from the Delta."
00:03:18.540,00:03:19.970,"You get some some salt water intrusions,"
00:03:19.970,00:03:21.510,"so you have some Bromide in the water."
00:03:21.510,00:03:24.623,"Bromide's harmless and it's almost impossible to remove."
00:03:24.623,00:03:27.920,"But, when you disinfect the water with Ozone,"
00:03:27.920,00:03:30.440,"that Bromide becomes Bromate."
00:03:30.440,00:03:31.750,"And Bromate is carcinogenic."
00:03:31.750,00:03:35.010,"And so around the year 2000 they wrote regulations"
00:03:35.010,00:03:35.960,"regulating Bromate."
00:03:35.960,00:03:37.760,"And the regulation basically said,"
00:03:37.760,00:03:40.110,"if you have a treatment plant that uses Ozone,"
00:03:40.110,00:03:42.870,"then you have to watch your Bromate formation."
00:03:42.870,00:03:44.080,"Be careful not to form too much."
00:03:44.080,00:03:46.220,"So, the only places we ever measured Bromate"
00:03:46.220,00:03:47.550,"was at our filter plant."
00:03:47.550,00:03:49.200,"- [Narrator] And the results were always within the"
00:03:49.200,00:03:52.480,"10 micrograms per liter limit set by regulators."
00:03:52.480,00:03:54.350,"So they were confused when they got a call"
00:03:54.350,00:03:57.400,"from one of their customers, a beverage company in LA."
00:03:57.400,00:03:59.230,"- They said, ""We have some really high levels"
00:03:59.230,00:04:01.240,"of Bromate showing up, are you aware of this?"""
00:04:01.240,00:04:03.670,"And we said, ""Well, we don't show anything."""
00:04:03.670,00:04:05.180,"- [Narrator] But between the filtration plant"
00:04:05.180,00:04:07.580,"and the customer was the reservoir."
00:04:07.580,00:04:09.730,"So they did some tests."
00:04:09.730,00:04:11.130,"- Almost immediately upon coming"
00:04:11.130,00:04:12.630,"into to this open reservoir,"
00:04:12.630,00:04:14.600,"the Bromate levels jumped."
00:04:14.600,00:04:17.540,"It turned out that Bromide with Chlorine,"
00:04:17.540,00:04:18.960,"which was supposed to be safe,"
00:04:18.960,00:04:21.280,"in bright sunlight formed Bromate"
00:04:21.280,00:04:23.050,"even more than Ozone did."
00:04:23.050,00:04:25.743,"And so we made the unfortunate scientific discovery"
00:04:25.743,00:04:29.010,"that actually was not part of any regulatory scheme."
00:04:29.010,00:04:31.400,"And so, here we are at the reservoir,"
00:04:31.400,00:04:34.520,"we have a water source that's got Bromide in it, harmless,"
00:04:34.520,00:04:37.120,"we have chlorine, we have to have to disinfect the water"
00:04:37.120,00:04:39.110,"and we have sunlight because it's open."
00:04:39.110,00:04:40.730,"The only choice we have is to remove sunlight."
00:04:40.730,00:04:42.660,"So, we looked at all sorts of things."
00:04:42.660,00:04:45.760,"We looked at floating tarps across the water,"
00:04:45.760,00:04:47.350,"and normally, you put a floating cover on the water"
00:04:47.350,00:04:49.540,"but that's a multi-year project."
00:04:49.540,00:04:50.970,"And so we said, ""Well, can we manufacture"
00:04:50.970,00:04:54.000,"these kind of trampoline with poly-like PVC pipe?"""
00:04:54.000,00:04:55.750,"And we said, ""Well, they'll just gonna become bird perches"
00:04:55.750,00:04:57.587,"and we'll have a big water quality problem."""
00:04:57.587,00:05:01.410,"Then we knew we had high-density polyethylene pipe,"
00:05:01.410,00:05:03.080,"which is used in the water industry,"
00:05:03.080,00:05:04.920,"and we know that it floats."
00:05:04.920,00:05:06.110,"We at one point thought about"
00:05:06.110,00:05:08.140,"can we get float a pile of pipe across the surface."
00:05:08.140,00:05:10.710,"Well, that's hard to do and very expensive"
00:05:10.710,00:05:12.150,"'cause it's a lot of material."
00:05:12.150,00:05:12.983,"So maybe we can take some pipe"
00:05:12.983,00:05:14.270,"and we can run it through a chipper"
00:05:14.270,00:05:16.510,"and we can make a debris field across the surface,"
00:05:16.510,00:05:18.890,"like the back corner of a lake somewhere."
00:05:18.890,00:05:21.190,"But, then you have all this mushy, warm water"
00:05:21.190,00:05:22.570,"with plastic floating on the top"
00:05:22.570,00:05:24.440,"and that however sounds like a Petri dish."
00:05:24.440,00:05:26.630,"And so low and behold, Dr. Bryan White,"
00:05:26.630,00:05:29.924,"did some research and he found the shade ball."
00:05:29.924,00:05:31.690,"(tranquil music)"
00:05:31.690,00:05:33.660,"- [Narrator] Except they weren't called shade balls"
00:05:33.660,00:05:34.536,"at the time."
00:05:34.536,00:05:36.010,"(tranquil music)"
00:05:36.010,00:05:39.210,"- This product existed and they were called bird balls"
00:05:39.210,00:05:42.940,"and they used it on ponds that had mine tailings,"
00:05:42.940,00:05:45.620,"where they didn't want waterfowl to go in and get poisoned."
00:05:45.620,00:05:47.868,"And also around airports where there are ponds"
00:05:47.868,00:05:49.520,"and they want to keep the waterfowl off"
00:05:49.520,00:05:52.077,"so they didn't take off and get into jet engines."
00:05:52.077,00:05:54.768,"(airplane engine roaring)"
00:05:54.768,00:05:56.410,"You know they have actually done wind tunnel testing"
00:05:56.410,00:05:59.451,"and they blew, you know, 50, 60 mile of winds across"
00:05:59.451,00:06:01.000,"so they could see how they'd behave."
00:06:01.000,00:06:03.270,"But, they were really made to deter birds and wildlife"
00:06:03.270,00:06:04.460,"from sitting on the water."
00:06:04.460,00:06:07.010,"- [Narrator] Did there used to be birds landing here more?"
00:06:07.010,00:06:07.843,"- Absolutely, yes."
00:06:07.843,00:06:08.676,"- [Narrator] Yeah?"
00:06:08.676,00:06:09.509,"- Yeah."
00:06:09.509,00:06:10.342,"Once we deployed these balls,"
00:06:10.342,00:06:11.710,"all the birds were gone."
00:06:11.710,00:06:13.770,"They used to just hangout, right?"
00:06:13.770,00:06:14.950,"Loiter at the curbs."
00:06:14.950,00:06:17.342,"- Yeah, they'd be all over the top of the dam."
00:06:17.342,00:06:18.620,"- [Hellen] You could see birds dropping everywhere."
00:06:18.620,00:06:20.640,"- [James] They'd be down at the outlet tower,"
00:06:20.640,00:06:21.630,"they'd be everywhere."
00:06:21.630,00:06:24.110,"We don't get 'em anymore like we used to."
00:06:24.110,00:06:25.780,"- [Narrator] But before being added to the reservoir,"
00:06:25.780,00:06:27.930,"the shade balls had to be tested."
00:06:27.930,00:06:30.720,"Would they actually reduce the formation of Bromate?"
00:06:30.720,00:06:32.676,"- And we bought three kiddie pools,"
00:06:32.676,00:06:34.560,"three little inflatable kiddie pools."
00:06:34.560,00:06:36.550,"And we filled them all with the reservoir water."
00:06:36.550,00:06:37.973,"One was in the sunlight, one we put a tarp on"
00:06:37.973,00:06:40.290,"and one put shade balls on."
00:06:40.290,00:06:42.440,"And amazingly, the shade balls knocked out"
00:06:42.440,00:06:44.230,"the problem immediately."
00:06:44.230,00:06:46.070,"- [Narrator] So the reason shade balls are black"
00:06:46.070,00:06:48.240,"is to block all light from reaching the water"
00:06:48.240,00:06:50.540,"and triggering the Bromate reaction."
00:06:50.540,00:06:52.040,"The black pigment is also safe"
00:06:52.040,00:06:53.380,"for contact with drinking water"
00:06:53.380,00:06:57.140,"and it's stable even exposed to the elements for years."
00:06:57.140,00:06:59.200,"- They're black for a reason so, you know,"
00:06:59.200,00:07:01.140,"they're made out of a high-density polyethylene."
00:07:01.140,00:07:02.560,"It's the same material that"
00:07:02.560,00:07:04.560,"like a gallon milk jug is made out of."
00:07:04.560,00:07:06.150,"It's a food grade plastic"
00:07:06.150,00:07:08.190,"and they would be clear like a milk carton,"
00:07:08.190,00:07:10.290,"except that they wouldn't last in the sun."
00:07:10.290,00:07:12.950,"And so, they have a material called carbon black in them"
00:07:12.950,00:07:15.230,"and that's what makes the plastic last"
00:07:15.230,00:07:16.810,"for at least 10 years out in the sun."
00:07:16.810,00:07:17.956,"We did test to see"
00:07:17.956,00:07:19.890,"if there is any other colors we could use."
00:07:19.890,00:07:22.090,"So we actually had the company make"
00:07:22.090,00:07:23.200,"three different shades of blue,"
00:07:23.200,00:07:25.397,"but the dyes were so unstable they said,"
00:07:25.397,00:07:27.580,"""We can't guarantee it's gonna last more than a year."""
00:07:27.580,00:07:29.147,"And so, it's that carbon black"
00:07:29.147,00:07:31.320,"that's the magic powder in this"
00:07:31.320,00:07:33.670,"that really makes this product last in the sunlight."
00:07:33.670,00:07:35.700,"One of the concerns that people raised to me"
00:07:35.700,00:07:37.900,"when we put first these on, it was that,"
00:07:37.900,00:07:40.370,"are they gonna get hot and then bleach the material out?"
00:07:40.370,00:07:41.203,"And they don't."
00:07:41.203,00:07:42.150,"They're totally inert."
00:07:42.150,00:07:43.560,"I mean, theoretically, you could cut off"
00:07:43.560,00:07:45.360,"a piece of this ball and you could chew it,"
00:07:45.360,00:07:46.280,"no harm comes to you."
00:07:46.280,00:07:48.260,"This is totally food grade,"
00:07:48.260,00:07:49.473,"nothing wrong with it whatsoever."
00:07:49.473,00:07:51.196,"- [Narrator] What's it like driving through these things?"
00:07:51.196,00:07:52.710,"- It's difficult."
00:07:52.710,00:07:54.625,"As you can see we've been sitting here for,"
00:07:54.625,00:07:56.790,"well, I don't know how long, quite a while,"
00:07:56.790,00:07:59.080,"and there's a breeze and we haven't moved."
00:07:59.080,00:08:00.040,"I mean anybody that knows,"
00:08:00.040,00:08:01.250,"that's been on a boat in a lake,"
00:08:01.250,00:08:02.960,"if there's a slight breeze and you're on a boat,"
00:08:02.960,00:08:04.410,"you're drifting, right?"
00:08:04.410,00:08:05.243,"Not here."
00:08:05.243,00:08:07.770,"This thing, they're just stable."
00:08:07.770,00:08:09.270,"They're (indistinct)"
00:08:09.270,00:08:11.340,"It's interesting when you try to pilot the boat"
00:08:11.340,00:08:12.900,"through these things, its difficult."
00:08:12.900,00:08:13.950,"- [Narrator] It's like driving through peanut butter"
00:08:13.950,00:08:14.783,"or something?"
00:08:14.783,00:08:16.030,"- Or something, I guess, yeah."
00:08:16.030,00:08:17.439,"Not that I've ever done that but..."
00:08:17.439,00:08:18.560,"(laughing)"
00:08:18.560,00:08:20.250,"- [Narrator] Blocking sunlight from the reservoir"
00:08:20.250,00:08:22.620,"also provided additional benefits."
00:08:22.620,00:08:24.370,"- You know, one of the reasons we put so much Chlorine"
00:08:24.370,00:08:25.670,"was to control the algae growth."
00:08:25.670,00:08:27.740,"But sometimes you still couldn't control it."
00:08:27.740,00:08:30.300,"There were times years ago, in the summer,"
00:08:30.300,00:08:32.230,"where if we had an algae outbreak,"
00:08:32.230,00:08:34.240,"you might actually, if you filled a bath tub up,"
00:08:34.240,00:08:35.720,"you might have a slight tinge of green."
00:08:35.720,00:08:37.220,"I mean, it maybe healthy to drink,"
00:08:37.220,00:08:39.060,"but it might have a slight tinge of green from the algae."
00:08:39.060,00:08:39.893,"- [Narrator] You'd see a bit of algae."
00:08:39.893,00:08:41.410,"- Yeah, and it's just discoloring the water."
00:08:41.410,00:08:42.380,"That no longer occurs."
00:08:42.380,00:08:44.710,"So, with the sunlight gone,"
00:08:44.710,00:08:46.170,"the algae problem is gone."
00:08:46.170,00:08:47.440,"We put in, basically, no Chlorine."
00:08:47.440,00:08:49.470,"We've only had a few times since the shade balls"
00:08:49.470,00:08:50.303,"have been on LA Reservoir,"
00:08:50.303,00:08:51.880,"that we've added any Chlorine at all."
00:08:51.880,00:08:53.250,"And we used to do half the Chlorine"
00:08:53.250,00:08:54.510,"and the whole water system"
00:08:54.510,00:08:57.140,"went into that reservoir just to control algae growth."
00:08:57.140,00:09:00.320,"- [Narrator] But the big concern I had was evaporation."
00:09:00.320,00:09:02.610,"When I first heard about these black plastic balls"
00:09:02.610,00:09:05.840,"reducing evaporation, it didn't seem to make any sense."
00:09:05.840,00:09:07.860,"I mean, wouldn't they absorb more energy"
00:09:07.860,00:09:11.267,"and so heat up the water, leading to faster evaporation?"
00:09:11.267,00:09:13.200,"It turns out the answer is, no,"
00:09:13.200,00:09:15.070,"for a number of reasons."
00:09:15.070,00:09:17.820,"In an open reservoir, there is more exposed surface area"
00:09:17.820,00:09:20.470,"where water molecules can escape into the air."
00:09:20.470,00:09:23.130,"Plus, there is greater air flow over the water's surface"
00:09:23.130,00:09:25.390,"continually removing the layer of moist air"
00:09:25.390,00:09:29.080,"and replacing it with dryer air, increasing evaporation."
00:09:29.080,00:09:31.370,"Now the shade balls do absorb more energy"
00:09:31.370,00:09:32.960,"and get hotter on top,"
00:09:32.960,00:09:35.320,"but the bottom of the balls stays cool."
00:09:35.320,00:09:37.050,"Plus the balls mostly contain air,"
00:09:37.050,00:09:38.740,"which is a good thermal insulator"
00:09:38.740,00:09:40.720,"and so not much of the heat is transferred"
00:09:40.720,00:09:41.720,"through to the water."
00:09:41.720,00:09:43.243,"- It's almost like a double-paned window,"
00:09:43.243,00:09:44.610,"you know, you get that air gap in there"
00:09:44.610,00:09:46.200,"and the air acts as an insulator,"
00:09:46.200,00:09:48.140,"and so the sun never hits the water."
00:09:48.140,00:09:49.540,"Matter of fact, we've actually done some measurements"
00:09:49.540,00:09:51.630,"and it's actually cooler under the shade balls,"
00:09:51.630,00:09:52.760,"even though they're black,"
00:09:52.760,00:09:53.880,"than it is without the balls,"
00:09:53.880,00:09:54.722,"just with the sun itself."
00:09:54.722,00:09:55.555,"- [Narrator] Huh?"
00:09:55.555,00:09:56.520,"- [Marty] So, the balls actually have a slight"
00:09:56.520,00:09:57.353,"cooling effect."
00:09:57.353,00:09:58.670,"- [Narrator] So, for all of these reasons,"
00:09:58.670,00:10:02.380,"shade balls reduce evaporation by 80 to 90%."
00:10:02.380,00:10:03.720,"That's pretty significant"
00:10:03.720,00:10:06.120,"for a dry climate like Los Angeles."
00:10:06.120,00:10:07.640,"- [Narrator] How much do they cost?"
00:10:07.640,00:10:10.600,"- These run about, around three for $1."
00:10:10.600,00:10:12.730,"I think we paid 33, 34 cents a piece,"
00:10:12.730,00:10:13.946,"something in that range."
00:10:13.946,00:10:16.160,"And they actually will have a salvage value,"
00:10:16.160,00:10:18.530,"not that much, but if we go to remove them,"
00:10:18.530,00:10:20.193,"they are recyclable material."
00:10:21.530,00:10:24.630,"But we figured that over the life of the balls,"
00:10:24.630,00:10:27.340,"between the savings in chlorination,"
00:10:27.340,00:10:28.550,"is chemical savings,"
00:10:28.550,00:10:30.350,"and the savings in evaporation,"
00:10:30.350,00:10:32.170,"probably at least half the cost of the balls"
00:10:32.170,00:10:33.224,"will be paid for."
00:10:33.224,00:10:35.020,"I mean, of course, the water quality benefit"
00:10:35.020,00:10:36.040,"is immeasurable,"
00:10:36.040,00:10:38.030,"but even the balls themselves will save money"
00:10:38.030,00:10:39.197,"doing what they do."
00:10:39.197,00:10:42.168,"- [Narrator] Do you ever bring people out here for tours?"
00:10:42.168,00:10:43.270,"- You're the first one."
00:10:43.270,00:10:44.103,"(laughing)"
00:10:44.103,00:10:44.936,"- [Narrator] Why am I the first one to get to go"
00:10:44.936,00:10:45.769,"on a tour here?"
00:10:45.769,00:10:48.220,"- To get this level of detailed of tour, yes."
00:10:48.220,00:10:49.440,"- [Narrator] This is so cool!"
00:10:49.440,00:10:52.230,"I've heard something about hexagonal balls,"
00:10:52.230,00:10:53.850,"have you heard anything about hexagonal balls?"
00:10:53.850,00:10:54.683,"- Oh, my gosh!"
00:10:54.683,00:10:56.400,"So, we have the shade balls, and of course,"
00:10:56.400,00:10:58.750,"everyone in the world came up with another product."
00:10:58.750,00:11:01.580,"I have ones I call se ravioli, it's a small hex."
00:11:01.580,00:11:04.010,"We've got large hexes, we have all sorts of pieces."
00:11:04.010,00:11:05.440,"And people said, ""Well, they lock together."""
00:11:05.440,00:11:07.527,"But the problem is, they need to not stack up"
00:11:07.527,00:11:09.410,"and they need to not sit on the bank of the reservoir."
00:11:09.410,00:11:10.970,"The reservoir is gonna go up and down."
00:11:10.970,00:11:13.160,"And so it was really the shape of the ball"
00:11:13.160,00:11:16.870,"that makes them not perch on the side"
00:11:16.870,00:11:18.520,"because we need to make sure that these,"
00:11:18.520,00:11:19.770,"when the water goes up and down,"
00:11:19.770,00:11:21.207,"that they spread up, or they, you know,"
00:11:21.207,00:11:23.480,"either spread out completely to cover the water"
00:11:23.480,00:11:24.570,"as best possible."
00:11:24.570,00:11:26.270,"- [Narrator] I mean, I just can't get over what I'm seeing,"
00:11:26.270,00:11:27.600,"it's just so nuts."
00:11:27.600,00:11:30.083,"- I'm waiting for you to say it looks like a pool of boba."
00:11:30.083,00:11:32.680,"(laughing)"
00:11:32.680,00:11:34.680,"- [Narrator] I feel like that's the line that'll go in,"
00:11:34.680,00:11:35.920,"but you got it."
00:11:35.920,00:11:36.753,"Like, that is,"
00:11:37.940,00:11:38.773,"that's awesome."
00:11:40.620,00:11:41.900,"Do you like boba?"
00:11:41.900,00:11:43.289,"- I love boba."
00:11:43.289,00:11:44.260,"(laughing)"
00:11:44.260,00:11:45.574,"I might get some after this."
00:11:45.574,00:11:46.700,"(laughing)"
00:11:46.700,00:11:49.208,"(techno sound)"
00:11:49.208,00:11:52.375,"(boat engine roaring)"
