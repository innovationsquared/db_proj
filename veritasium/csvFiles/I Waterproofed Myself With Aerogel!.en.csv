00:00:00.030,00:00:01.100,"I feel confident"
00:00:01.100,00:00:04.900,"You're confident that I am NOT gonna be damaged?"
00:00:04.900,00:00:05.670,"not permanently"
00:00:05.670,00:00:07.220,"okay"
00:00:07.220,00:00:10.860,"let me back up for a moment. I want to talk about the properties of aerogel"
00:00:10.860,00:00:13.100,"the world's lightest solid."
00:00:13.100,00:00:14.549,"What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna lean in so it's"
00:00:14.549,00:00:17.460,"coming in through this mic and then can you do that again yeah"
00:00:18.260,00:00:20.240,"this is what it sounds like"
00:00:20.880,00:00:22.460,"that is weird"
00:00:22.460,00:00:25.460,"it has a metallic ring first recognized"
00:00:25.460,00:00:30.380,"by aerogel's inventor Samuel Kistler all the way back in 1931."
00:00:30.380,00:00:31.710,"now aerogel is an"
00:00:31.710,00:00:36.480,"excellent thermal insulator but it's not the easiest material to work with can I"
00:00:36.480,00:00:44.010,"try it sure oh I didn't I don't quite have the touch oh I can't I make it ring"
00:00:44.010,00:00:49.110,"oh no look it didn't take a whole lot to break it right it breaks pretty easily"
00:00:49.110,00:00:54.030,"so is there a way to take the extraordinary thermal insulation of"
00:00:54.030,00:00:58.020,"aerogel but make it more usable what I put together here is just a combination"
00:00:58.020,00:01:03.750,"of aerogel particles silica aerogel particles and a non-flammable binder and"
00:01:03.750,00:01:06.180,"you should be able to put it on your your skin and hit yourself with the"
00:01:06.180,00:01:11.820,"torch should right I'll give it a shot okay so you just take a little bit and"
00:01:11.820,00:01:15.090,"squeeze it around your finger just around yeah just squeeze it around here"
00:01:15.090,00:01:20.670,"one finger a two fingers you want matter how's that am I am i doing it oh yeah"
00:01:20.670,00:01:23.670,"that's that's yeah I'll be good just wanna make sure the fire when it goes"
00:01:23.670,00:01:27.299,"around your finger doesn't hit the Bearskin seems like it's pretty thin"
00:01:27.299,00:01:33.180,"around this finger tip here like how thick should it be you're making me"
00:01:33.180,00:01:37.880,"nervous holding a blowtorch can I do the"
00:01:37.880,00:01:41.220,"blowtorching or you can do the blowtorching absolutely because I mean"
00:01:41.220,00:01:47.430,"if this is if this goes wrong so how hot is a blowtorch flame well it's really"
00:01:47.430,00:01:52.590,"hard to tell but from our experience it's usually you know at least 1500"
00:01:52.590,00:01:59.720,"degrees C and can get as hot as 2000 so yeah this is very hot all right let's"
00:01:59.720,00:02:08.270,"try it this is so wrong that little jittery pot there I you know it looks"
00:02:08.270,00:02:14.200,"like I'm toasting a marshmallow whoa why is it flaming like that and"
00:02:14.200,00:02:18.980,"what is burning binder right now correct should people just hold the rate on"
00:02:18.980,00:02:26.090,"there it doesn't feel hot at all my finger does not feel hot at all"
00:02:26.090,00:02:32.180,"that is insane right there propriety I cannot believe how a little"
00:02:32.180,00:02:38.690,"warmth I feel passing through that the FLIR 10 2013 10 per ature ranges and"
00:02:38.690,00:02:43.790,"here the aerogel is clearly hotter than the 160 degrees Celsius upper limit I"
00:02:43.790,00:02:49.640,"mean it's glowing orange hot so it's clearly incredibly hot I mean if you can"
00:02:49.640,00:02:54.170,"see the blackbody radiation you know that it's very hot so we went"
00:02:54.170,00:03:05.510,"to the highest temperature range so this goes up to 2,000 Celsius 881 907 907 907"
00:03:05.510,00:03:14.049,"degrees Celsius that is absurd pretty good right in front of my finger"
00:03:14.049,00:03:22.939,"what so this was was about almost a thousand Celsius but behind this thin"
00:03:22.939,00:03:36.260,"layer of aerogel my fingers are just just warm Wow I mean it is clear this"
00:03:36.260,00:03:41.209,"stuff insulates this video is about taking air gels extraordinary properties"
00:03:41.209,00:03:47.000,"and improving on them for example I'm about to step into this pool without"
00:03:47.000,00:04:02.959,"getting wet there's a layer of air there right next to my skin that thin layer of"
00:04:02.959,00:04:07.790,"air is what makes my skin looks silvery light from certain angles reflects off"
00:04:07.790,00:04:12.439,"the water air interface in what's called total internal reflection that is very"
00:04:12.439,00:04:18.010,"strange this is a really cool effect I mean just besides the fact that I'm"
00:04:18.010,00:04:24.500,"basically waterproof I feel like this extra air on me is making me more"
00:04:24.500,00:04:29.479,"buoyant than usual let me try coming out by the water and"
00:04:29.479,00:04:32.320,"see if I'm still dry"
00:04:34.650,00:04:42.390,"that is true I don't I don't really feel wet at all"
00:04:45.000,00:04:53.530,"that was weird really weird so how did I make myself waterproof I did it with"
00:04:53.530,00:05:01.420,"aerogel particles by taking a bucket of them and coating myself with the tiny"
00:05:01.420,00:05:06.430,"best but this is a kind of strange way to become waterproof because normal"
00:05:06.430,00:05:12.910,"silica aerogel is hydrophilic there we go now this is a hydrophilic aerogel so"
00:05:12.910,00:05:19.990,"all those OAH groups inside the aerogel are absorbing the liquid and causing the"
00:05:19.990,00:05:24.400,"aerogel structure to collapse aerogel is really good at absorbing water for two"
00:05:24.400,00:05:29.890,"reasons first it contains a lot of surface area due to its nano scales"
00:05:29.890,00:05:34.960,"sponge-like structure an ice cube sized piece of aerogel contains half a"
00:05:34.960,00:05:39.790,"football field of surface area that makes it good at absorbing lots of"
00:05:39.790,00:05:43.480,"molecules something scientists have sought to exploit my favorite"
00:05:43.480,00:05:47.410,"application which I still think today is a good idea is what's the idea is a a"
00:05:47.410,00:05:52.900,"physical insecticide so most insecticides work by being neurotoxins"
00:05:52.900,00:05:57.280,"they're called cholinesterase inhibitors it's the same mechanism as nerve gas and"
00:05:57.280,00:06:01.390,"we spray this on crops and things but a physical insecticide works by basically"
00:06:01.390,00:06:06.070,"getting stuck to the outer skin of the insect and and basically sucking all the"
00:06:06.070,00:06:11.650,"moisture the or the oils out of them to the point where they just sort of dry"
00:06:11.650,00:06:16.450,"out to death it's kind of like putting salt on a Sluggers yeah that's a very"
00:06:16.450,00:06:19.870,"good analogy exactly the other reason it's good at absorbing water"
00:06:19.870,00:06:24.940,"specifically is because it's structure is covered with OAH groups which attract"
00:06:24.940,00:06:30.010,"water molecules and that makes it ideal for use in museums in the past I've been"
00:06:30.010,00:06:35.410,"working with a company in Italy called opium which makes Museum cases I mean"
00:06:35.410,00:06:38.860,"they made the case for Mona Lisa they are interested in putting aerogels in"
00:06:38.860,00:06:42.280,"the cases because it's a passive moisture a regulator essentially once"
00:06:42.280,00:06:45.180,"you have it inside if the moisture increases the original"
00:06:45.180,00:06:50.220,"a lot of it if it decreases it releases some of it air gels ability to absorb is"
00:06:50.220,00:06:54.930,"even being used right now to help detect Mars quakes these were the ones that"
00:06:54.930,00:07:00.570,"were made for the NASA insight mission this aerogel looks like chalk because"
00:07:00.570,00:07:05.220,"so-called zeolite particles are dispersed throughout it they can absorb"
00:07:05.220,00:07:10.229,"moisture even at very low pressures there's a seismometer that contains"
00:07:10.229,00:07:14.639,"three small seismometers and requires since they're so small they require"
00:07:14.639,00:07:19.650,"exceptional vacuum inside otherwise the motion get stamped so that's what we"
00:07:19.650,00:07:23.520,"developed this for the zoo lights were helping absorb the moisture"
00:07:23.520,00:07:27.840,"predominantly that was coming off of the hypotheses and gave me some gassing"
00:07:27.840,00:07:32.039,"different things so that is it's sort of maintaining the vacuum by keeping -"
00:07:32.039,00:07:35.610,"pulling things it's actually a vacuum ball if you think of it that way and"
00:07:35.610,00:07:39.720,"what's interesting about it is it does not require any power any consumptions"
00:07:39.720,00:07:44.449,"very light so essentially this is what enabled the inside mission to work"
00:07:44.449,00:07:49.949,"aerogel can absorb up to 25 times its weight in water but for some"
00:07:49.949,00:07:55.770,"applications this is less than ideal so once we've done this is that piece of"
00:07:55.770,00:07:59.909,"aerogel ruined now pretty much yeah that's that's entropy irreversible"
00:07:59.909,00:08:05.400,"damage there to counteract this issue we take a hydrophobe it's a reactive"
00:08:05.400,00:08:10.409,"chemical that when it touches a no H group spontaneously rearranges with that"
00:08:10.409,00:08:15.630,"o age group and creates this big non-polar group and that repels water so"
00:08:15.630,00:08:20.639,"by replacing just 30% of the Oh H groups that line the inside of the aerogel with"
00:08:20.639,00:08:25.349,"these hydrophobic groups you can make an aerogel that perfectly repels water so"
00:08:25.349,00:08:31.979,"here water bounces off it's totally impervious it does not penetrate in and"
00:08:31.979,00:08:36.810,"it can sit on water for months and it will be just the same as if it was never"
00:08:36.810,00:08:44.690,"wetted at all you ready I guess let's go shot there it goes"
00:08:46.860,00:08:51.100,"it feels funny cuz it like it hardly feels like the water is touching me"
00:08:51.100,00:08:54.279,"because in a way the water isn't touching it's not touching you"
00:08:54.279,00:09:00.370,"that's what's amazing at the molecular level it is being repelled look how"
00:09:00.370,00:09:06.040,"crazy that it's like a weird laminar flow this is so trippy"
00:09:06.040,00:09:12.550,"so aerogel can be made impervious to water or more adsorbent it is naturally"
00:09:12.550,00:09:18.070,"brittle but it can be worked into a sticky paste and so far I've really only"
00:09:18.070,00:09:22.810,"focused on silica aerogel but air gels can be made out of all sorts of"
00:09:22.810,00:09:28.480,"different materials so all of these materials are nano structured that's"
00:09:28.480,00:09:32.529,"right and they have nano sized pores around 20 nanometers in size that's"
00:09:32.529,00:09:38.709,"right and they are over 50% err correct which is why they're also light"
00:09:38.709,00:09:43.959,"lightweight yeah some of them are made of polymers and there is a trade-off"
00:09:43.959,00:09:48.610,"between thermal and mechanical properties a traditional silica aerogel"
00:09:48.610,00:09:53.950,"is typically around 15 milliwatts per meter Kelvin thermal conductivity so"
00:09:53.950,00:09:59.290,"that means about 3 times 2 to 3 times better insulating than styrofoam these"
00:09:59.290,00:10:03.430,"materials would be between one and a half to two times more insulating than"
00:10:03.430,00:10:07.750,"styrofoam somewhere around 20 to 26 milliwatts per meter Kelvin this is a"
00:10:07.750,00:10:12.070,"poly a madero gel this chemistry came from NASA so it's a great insulating"
00:10:12.070,00:10:18.040,"material but it's not flammable knock on it it feels like wood internally we call"
00:10:18.040,00:10:22.270,"it Martian tape another way to make aerogel more workable is to incorporate"
00:10:22.270,00:10:26.400,"it into composite materials like blankets something that's in between"
00:10:26.400,00:10:31.570,"silicon and silica that feels nice it feels very nice doesn't this feels like"
00:10:31.570,00:10:35.829,"almost like a stuffed animal yeah exactly"
00:10:35.829,00:10:41.200,"so this is a new type of aerogel blanket that in the future we may find in"
00:10:41.200,00:10:45.070,"something like an astronaut suit or maybe even apparel what this material is"
00:10:45.070,00:10:48.579,"actually it's fiberglass it does feel like it's a fiberglass that's been"
00:10:48.579,00:10:53.350,"infused with aerogel and so that fiberglass aerogel composite"
00:10:53.350,00:10:57.379,"so because aerogels are traditionally very fragile bike um"
00:10:57.379,00:11:00.709,"positing it with the fiberglass allows you to make something that can be flexed"
00:11:00.709,00:11:06.470,"and cut and sewn and wrapped it's not the most cuddly it it sheds dust when"
00:11:06.470,00:11:10.970,"you tap on it but go ahead and dust is that that's silica aerogel to morphus"
00:11:10.970,00:11:15.769,"silica and it's it's very safe it's not for example like quartz fiber or"
00:11:15.769,00:11:20.119,"asbestos which are you know long aspect-ratio fibers that the body has no"
00:11:20.119,00:11:24.139,"chemical means or physical means of breaking down this stuff is readily"
00:11:24.139,00:11:28.669,"captured and and expelled by the body and it's it's not dangerous and this is"
00:11:28.669,00:11:33.199,"what they use to insulate subsea oil pipelines and refineries and all sorts"
00:11:33.199,00:11:38.089,"of applications so just that thickness will insulate a pipeline yeah so that"
00:11:38.089,00:11:42.769,"thickness that that one this is one centimeter thick in one centimeter you"
00:11:42.769,00:11:48.159,"get the same effective insulation value as three centimeters over an inch of"
00:11:48.159,00:11:54.949,"mineral wool or fiberglass by itself so it's a tremendously better insulator"
00:11:54.949,00:11:58.970,"this blanket is actually what I'm gonna put to the test in the final episode of"
00:11:58.970,00:12:05.079,"the aerogel trilogy so subscribe if you don't want to miss it"
