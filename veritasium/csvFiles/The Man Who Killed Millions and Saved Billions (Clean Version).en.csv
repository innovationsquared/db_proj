00:00:00.000,00:00:02.820,"- The 1918 Nobel Prize for Chemistry"
00:00:02.820,00:00:07.260,"is probably the most important Nobel Prize ever awarded."
00:00:07.260,00:00:10.260,"It was given to German scientist Fritz Haber"
00:00:10.260,00:00:12.600,"for solving one of the biggest problems"
00:00:12.600,00:00:14.940,"humanity has ever faced."
00:00:14.940,00:00:17.670,"His invention is directly responsible"
00:00:17.670,00:00:22.140,"for the lives of 4 billion people today."
00:00:22.140,00:00:24.510,"But when he received his prize,"
00:00:24.510,00:00:27.960,"many of his peers refused to attend."
00:00:27.960,00:00:29.580,"Two other Nobel Prize winners"
00:00:29.580,00:00:32.010,"rejected their awards in protest"
00:00:32.010,00:00:36.210,"and the New York Times wrote a scathing article about him."
00:00:36.210,00:00:39.870,"He is simultaneously one of the most impactful"
00:00:39.870,00:00:43.254,"and tragic scientists of all time."
00:00:43.254,00:00:45.990,"(dramatic orchestral music)"
00:00:45.990,00:00:48.450,"Perhaps more than any other single person,"
00:00:48.450,00:00:52.032,"he has shaped the world we live in today."
00:00:52.032,00:00:55.699,"(dramatic orchestral music)"
00:00:57.387,00:00:59.887,"(tense music)"
00:01:03.270,00:01:05.430,"If you are an American citizen"
00:01:05.430,00:01:08.700,"and you find an island with a lot of bird poop on it,"
00:01:08.700,00:01:10.920,"well then you can claim that island"
00:01:10.920,00:01:14.700,"for the United States and the US will have your back."
00:01:14.700,00:01:18.630,"The president is authorized to send in the Navy and the Army"
00:01:18.630,00:01:22.740,"to defend your newly discovered poop-covered island."
00:01:22.740,00:01:25.080,"There are currently 10 American islands"
00:01:25.080,00:01:27.810,"that were claimed in this way."
00:01:27.810,00:01:30.810,"And even though the law that made this possible"
00:01:30.810,00:01:33.480,"was passed in 1856,"
00:01:33.480,00:01:37.230,"it is still in effect to this day."
00:01:37.230,00:01:42.230,"So, why did people want poop-covered islands so badly?"
00:01:42.233,00:01:45.450,"(birds chirping) (""The Blue Danube"")"
00:01:45.450,00:01:48.360,"There are a few dozen islands off the coast of Peru"
00:01:48.360,00:01:51.480,"where millions of seabirds gather to mate"
00:01:51.480,00:01:54.660,"and the waters near the island are full of fish,"
00:01:54.660,00:01:57.960,"and these millions of birds eat the fish,"
00:01:57.960,00:01:59.553,"and then they poop,"
00:02:00.510,00:02:02.227,"a lot."
00:02:02.227,00:02:03.180,"(""The Blue Danube"")"
00:02:03.180,00:02:05.310,"Since the region is hot and dry,"
00:02:05.310,00:02:09.810,"this poop solidifies and accumulates over millennia."
00:02:09.810,00:02:11.880,"There are cliffs of bird poop"
00:02:11.880,00:02:15.698,"30 meters or a hundred feet high."
00:02:15.698,00:02:18.698,"(""The Blue Danube"")"
00:02:21.180,00:02:23.790,"And technically bird poop is called guano"
00:02:23.790,00:02:25.800,"and by the mid 1800s,"
00:02:25.800,00:02:29.160,"buying and selling bird guano was big business."
00:02:29.160,00:02:33.510,"The price rose as high as $76 per pound"
00:02:33.510,00:02:36.420,"meaning you could trade four pounds of guano"
00:02:36.420,00:02:38.910,"for one pound of gold."
00:02:38.910,00:02:42.540,"So, why was there such a big market for bird poop?"
00:02:42.540,00:02:43.740,"Well, to answer that"
00:02:43.740,00:02:46.323,"we have to look inside the human body."
00:02:48.630,00:02:51.360,"By weight, most of our bodies are made up of"
00:02:51.360,00:02:54.420,"oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen."
00:02:54.420,00:02:58.380,"But the fourth most common element is nitrogen."
00:02:58.380,00:03:02.340,"Nitrogen is part of the amino acids that form proteins."
00:03:02.340,00:03:03.660,"It's part of hemoglobin,"
00:03:03.660,00:03:06.420,"the compound that carries oxygen in red blood cells"
00:03:06.420,00:03:10.680,"and it's a central component of DNA and RNA."
00:03:10.680,00:03:15.060,"Nitrogen is essential for all life on earth."
00:03:15.060,00:03:17.820,"We get our nitrogen by eating plants"
00:03:17.820,00:03:20.490,"or animals which have eaten plants,"
00:03:20.490,00:03:23.433,"and plants get their nitrogen from the soil."
00:03:24.630,00:03:28.920,"The problem is if you farm the same soil year after year,"
00:03:28.920,00:03:31.680,"you harvest the nitrogen out of it"
00:03:31.680,00:03:33.810,"and eventually there isn't enough nitrogen"
00:03:33.810,00:03:35.940,"for healthy plants to grow."
00:03:35.940,00:03:39.210,"They can't produce enough chlorophyll to photosynthesize"
00:03:39.210,00:03:41.610,"which stunts their growth."
00:03:41.610,00:03:43.020,"Their leaves turn yellow"
00:03:43.020,00:03:46.440,"and they are more susceptible to pests and disease."
00:03:46.440,00:03:48.090,"Crucially, for farmers,"
00:03:48.090,00:03:52.230,"nitrogen deficiency means smaller yields."
00:03:52.230,00:03:56.520,"The way to fix this is to add nitrogen back into the soil"
00:03:56.520,00:03:58.773,"which is where bird guano comes in."
00:03:59.710,00:04:00.630,"(rhythmic music)"
00:04:00.630,00:04:04.110,"Guano is up to 20% nitrogen."
00:04:04.110,00:04:06.960,"Hundreds of years ago, Incan farmers realized"
00:04:06.960,00:04:10.560,"that adding guano to their soil made crops grow taller."
00:04:10.560,00:04:12.600,"This is what allowed them to grow food"
00:04:12.600,00:04:15.060,"in places that were previously unfarmable"
00:04:15.060,00:04:16.953,"and expand their empire."
00:04:18.780,00:04:21.150,"South America's rich deposits of bird poop"
00:04:21.150,00:04:24.000,"did not go unnoticed by the rest of the world."
00:04:24.000,00:04:27.870,"In 1865, Spain went to war against its former colonies"
00:04:27.870,00:04:30.690,"of Peru, Chile, Ecuador, and Bolivia"
00:04:30.690,00:04:34.650,"for control of their guano-laden islands."
00:04:34.650,00:04:36.840,"But such was the world's appetite for nitrogen"
00:04:36.840,00:04:40.710,"that by 1872 guano was running out"
00:04:40.710,00:04:43.320,"and Peru banned further exports."
00:04:43.320,00:04:47.632,"The world would need another way to get its nitrogen fix."
00:04:47.632,00:04:50.100,"(tense music)"
00:04:50.100,00:04:52.080,"This was a crisis."
00:04:52.080,00:04:53.940,"William Crooks, a British chemist,"
00:04:53.940,00:04:57.090,"made a dire prophecy in 1898."
00:04:57.090,00:04:58.920,"With the world's growing population"
00:04:58.920,00:05:01.590,"and dwindling supplies of nitrogen,"
00:05:01.590,00:05:04.410,"he said, ""We stand in deadly peril"
00:05:04.410,00:05:06.210,"of not having enough to eat."""
00:05:06.210,00:05:08.790,"In less than 30 years time, he argued,"
00:05:08.790,00:05:13.320,"people all over the world will be dying of starvation,"
00:05:13.320,00:05:16.507,"but he also proposed a solution."
00:05:16.507,00:05:19.890,"""It is the chemist who must come to the rescue."
00:05:19.890,00:05:21.360,"It is through the laboratory"
00:05:21.360,00:05:25.077,"that starvation may ultimately be turned into plenty."""
00:05:27.150,00:05:30.750,"Because here's the thing, nitrogen isn't rare,"
00:05:30.750,00:05:32.100,"it's common."
00:05:32.100,00:05:35.970,"78% of the air is nitrogen"
00:05:35.970,00:05:39.600,"but it's in a form that plants and animals can't use."
00:05:39.600,00:05:44.370,"Two atoms of nitrogen triple bonded together."
00:05:44.370,00:05:48.210,"This bond is one of the strongest in nature."
00:05:48.210,00:05:50.460,"The way to measure the strength of a chemical bond"
00:05:50.460,00:05:53.910,"is by the amount of energy that's required to break it."
00:05:53.910,00:05:56.910,"So, to break apart two chlorine atoms, for example,"
00:05:56.910,00:06:00.150,"would take 2 1/2 electron volts."
00:06:00.150,00:06:04.470,"To break apart two carbons requires 3.8 eV."
00:06:04.470,00:06:07.650,"Two oxygens, 5.2 eV."
00:06:07.650,00:06:10.440,"But to break apart two atoms of nitrogen"
00:06:10.440,00:06:15.440,"requires 9.8 electron volts, a tremendous amount of energy."
00:06:16.739,00:06:19.650,"(models clattering)"
00:06:19.650,00:06:21.210,"I just want to interject to say"
00:06:21.210,00:06:23.040,"that the molecular models in this video"
00:06:23.040,00:06:25.410,"were actually invented by me."
00:06:25.410,00:06:28.470,"These are Snatoms, a product I kickstarted"
00:06:28.470,00:06:30.090,"about eight years ago"
00:06:30.090,00:06:33.840,"where all the atoms snapped together magnetically."
00:06:33.840,00:06:37.410,"So, you can feel the attraction between atoms"
00:06:37.410,00:06:39.636,"and hear the energy released"
00:06:39.636,00:06:40.469,"(atoms clicks)"
00:06:40.469,00:06:41.580,"when bonds form."
00:06:41.580,00:06:44.340,"The resulting molecules look and behave"
00:06:44.340,00:06:46.350,"more like real molecules"
00:06:46.350,00:06:50.100,"and they are quicker and easier to form and break apart."
00:06:50.100,00:06:53.940,"Snatoms are for sale on Amazon and snatoms.com."
00:06:53.940,00:06:57.330,"So, I will put some links down in the description."
00:06:57.330,00:07:00.060,"Now, this video is a repost."
00:07:00.060,00:07:03.000,"The original upload got over 14 million views"
00:07:03.000,00:07:07.410,"and then suddenly it was age-restricted and demonetized."
00:07:07.410,00:07:09.510,"But I think it's a really good video,"
00:07:09.510,00:07:13.380,"so we're reposting it with the offending section removed."
00:07:13.380,00:07:15.570,"It's a reminder that you can't always count"
00:07:15.570,00:07:17.310,"on YouTube monetization."
00:07:17.310,00:07:19.650,"So, if you want to support these videos,"
00:07:19.650,00:07:21.450,"please consider purchasing Snatoms"
00:07:21.450,00:07:24.510,"if you want some or supporting us on Patreon."
00:07:24.510,00:07:28.945,"And now back to splitting nitrogen molecules."
00:07:28.945,00:07:31.158,"(models clattering)"
00:07:31.158,00:07:32.940,"(thunder claps)"
00:07:32.940,00:07:35.763,"There are two processes that do this naturally."
00:07:37.140,00:07:39.870,"Lightning releases so much energy,"
00:07:39.870,00:07:44.430,"it breaks apart in two into individual nitrogen atoms."
00:07:44.430,00:07:48.570,"They then quickly react to form nitrogen oxides"
00:07:48.570,00:07:51.420,"and these molecules stay in the atmosphere"
00:07:51.420,00:07:54.690,"until they react with water droplets in clouds"
00:07:54.690,00:07:57.600,"and fall to the ground in rain."
00:07:57.600,00:08:00.780,"There are also a few types of bacteria living in soil"
00:08:00.780,00:08:02.940,"that can break the N2 bond"
00:08:02.940,00:08:06.480,"using a tremendous amount of energy to do so,"
00:08:06.480,00:08:10.020,"and they make nitrogen available for plants."
00:08:10.020,00:08:13.500,"But bacteria only replenish the nitrogen slowly"
00:08:13.500,00:08:15.060,"and there's not enough lightning"
00:08:15.060,00:08:17.610,"to produce nitrogen compounds at scale."
00:08:17.610,00:08:20.040,"So, chemists tried."
00:08:20.040,00:08:24.270,"In 1811, Georg Hildebrandt mixed nitrogen and hydrogen"
00:08:24.270,00:08:27.600,"in a sealed flask trying to make ammonia,"
00:08:27.600,00:08:31.263,"one of the nitrogen-containing molecules found in guano."
00:08:32.130,00:08:35.070,"When that didn't work, he submerged the flask"
00:08:35.070,00:08:38.940,"300 meters underwater to increase the pressure"
00:08:38.940,00:08:40.350,"and that didn't work either,"
00:08:40.350,00:08:42.930,"but he was on the right track."
00:08:42.930,00:08:45.750,"Increasingly sophisticated versions of these experiments"
00:08:45.750,00:08:48.810,"were carried out over the following hundred years."
00:08:48.810,00:08:50.493,"All of them failed."
00:08:52.050,00:08:53.610,"So, when Fritz Haber became"
00:08:53.610,00:08:56.010,"interested in this problem in 1904,"
00:08:56.010,00:08:59.970,"he was joining a long line of failed chemists."
00:08:59.970,00:09:03.630,"He was 36 years old, working as a low level academic"
00:09:03.630,00:09:06.000,"at the University of Karlsruhe."
00:09:06.000,00:09:07.710,"He was also a new father"
00:09:07.710,00:09:11.370,"with a two-year-old boy named Herman and a wife, Clara,"
00:09:11.370,00:09:15.660,"who was one of the first women to get a PhD in chemistry."
00:09:15.660,00:09:18.990,"Driven by pride and competition with another scientist,"
00:09:18.990,00:09:21.990,"Haber spent five years on the problem."
00:09:21.990,00:09:25.140,"His idea was to combine nitrogen and hydrogen"
00:09:25.140,00:09:29.310,"not only at high pressure, but also at high temperature,"
00:09:29.310,00:09:31.230,"and in the presence of a catalyst,"
00:09:31.230,00:09:33.300,"something that lowers the amount of energy"
00:09:33.300,00:09:36.630,"required to split diatomic nitrogen."
00:09:36.630,00:09:40.740,"To do this, new experimental apparatus had to be invented."
00:09:40.740,00:09:43.500,"Haber worked tirelessly on this project"
00:09:43.500,00:09:45.210,"building equipment that could tolerate"
00:09:45.210,00:09:48.180,"ever higher temperatures and pressures."
00:09:48.180,00:09:50.100,"He also got lucky."
00:09:50.100,00:09:53.100,"At the time he was moonlighting as a technical consultant"
00:09:53.100,00:09:55.440,"for a light bulb manufacturer."
00:09:55.440,00:09:57.180,"So, there he had access"
00:09:57.180,00:10:00.420,"to lots of really hard to find materials."
00:10:00.420,00:10:02.520,"Like the element osmium."
00:10:02.520,00:10:04.200,"Osmium is rare."
00:10:04.200,00:10:07.260,"In his day, there was only about 100 kilograms"
00:10:07.260,00:10:09.750,"of the refined metal in existence"
00:10:09.750,00:10:12.180,"but the company he worked for was experimenting"
00:10:12.180,00:10:14.910,"with using it for filaments in their light bulbs."
00:10:14.910,00:10:18.450,"So, they had most of the world's supply."
00:10:18.450,00:10:21.930,"Haber suspected it might make the perfect catalyst"
00:10:21.930,00:10:24.543,"so he brought a sample back to his lab."
00:10:25.440,00:10:28.500,"And there in the third week of March 1909,"
00:10:28.500,00:10:32.550,"Haber placed his sheet of osmium in the pressure chamber"
00:10:32.550,00:10:35.160,"and then he pressurized and heated the nitrogen"
00:10:35.160,00:10:40.160,"and hydrogen to 200 atmospheres and 500 degrees Celsius."
00:10:40.650,00:10:45.030,"Under these conditions, the triple bonds broke apart"

00:12:03.630,00:12:07.050,"The invention made Fritz Haber a wealthy man."
00:12:07.050,00:12:10.080,"He got a promotion becoming the founding director"

00:12:26.340,00:12:28.773,"he stayed the night at Haber's house."
00:12:29.610,00:12:32.700,"But if Haber was so well-regarded,"
00:12:32.700,00:12:34.890,"why was he shunned by colleagues"
00:12:34.890,00:12:36.873,"when he won the Nobel Prize?"
00:12:37.800,00:12:41.463,"Well, it all comes down to what happened in World War I."
00:12:43.470,00:12:45.000,"When the war broke out,"
00:12:45.000,00:12:48.120,"Haber volunteered for military duty."

00:12:51.210,00:12:53.010,"Haber was a patriot."
00:12:53.010,00:12:57.300,"He wanted to use his expertise to help his country."
00:12:57.300,00:12:59.370,"Only a few months into the war,"
00:12:59.370,00:13:01.080,"the German army was already"

00:13:07.530,00:13:09.810,"is also an explosive."
00:13:09.810,00:13:12.873,"Just look at what happened in Beirut in August of 2020."

00:13:25.560,00:13:29.970,"And in the extreme heat, the fertilizer detonated."
00:13:29.970,00:13:33.960,"The blast which could be heard hundreds of kilometers away"
00:13:33.960,00:13:36.720,"killed at least 217 people"
00:13:36.720,00:13:39.060,"and injured thousands more."

00:13:45.090,00:13:49.500,"This is just one of many fertilizer-related explosions."
00:13:49.500,00:13:52.110,"The Oppau plant where Haber's process"
00:13:52.110,00:13:56.403,"was first put into practice would also explode in 1921."
00:13:57.780,00:14:00.210,"And the reason is nitrogen."
00:14:00.210,00:14:02.940,"We've already seen that it takes a tremendous"
00:14:02.940,00:14:06.930,"amount of energy to break apart nitrogen's triple bond."
00:14:06.930,00:14:08.730,"But the flip side of that coin"
00:14:08.730,00:14:10.830,"is that when two nitrogen atoms come together"
00:14:10.830,00:14:12.261,"and form that bond,"
00:14:12.261,00:14:13.094,"(atoms clicks)"
00:14:13.094,00:14:16.920,"a huge amount of energy is released."
00:14:16.920,00:14:20.460,"The explosions of gunpowder, TNT, nitroglycerin,"
00:14:20.460,00:14:23.340,"and ammonium nitrate all form"
00:14:23.340,00:14:26.250,"diatomic nitrogen gas as a product."
00:14:26.250,00:14:28.530,"And the formation of that triple bond"
00:14:28.530,00:14:30.630,"is where these chemicals derive"
00:14:30.630,00:14:33.003,"much of their explosive energy."
00:14:34.530,00:14:36.870,"Haber lobbied to convert the factories"
00:14:36.870,00:14:39.660,"using his process to make ammonia for fertilizer"
00:14:39.660,00:14:42.933,"to create nitrate for explosives instead."
00:14:44.040,00:14:47.640,"His superiors believed such a conversion to be impossible,"
00:14:47.640,00:14:49.140,"but Haber persisted,"
00:14:49.140,00:14:51.450,"and soon his chemical process"
00:14:51.450,00:14:54.840,"was at the heart of the German war machine."
00:14:54.840,00:14:59.613,"From bread out of the air to bombs out of the air."
00:15:01.208,00:15:03.930,"(gun popping)"
00:15:03.930,00:15:05.790,"But Haber thought chemistry could make"
00:15:05.790,00:15:08.490,"an even bigger contribution to the war."
00:15:08.490,00:15:12.600,"In December 1914, he witnessed a chemical weapons test."
00:15:12.600,00:15:15.090,"He was unimpressed."
00:15:15.090,00:15:17.850,"Haber believed that he could do better."
00:15:17.850,00:15:19.410,"He set out to make a gas"
00:15:19.410,00:15:22.170,"that was deadly at low concentrations"
00:15:22.170,00:15:24.120,"and heavier than air"
00:15:24.120,00:15:27.570,"so it would sink into enemy trenches."
00:15:27.570,00:15:30.300,"Projectiles carrying chemical weapons were banned,"
00:15:30.300,00:15:34.710,"at least in theory, by the Hague Convention of 1899."
00:15:34.710,00:15:36.990,"But in practice after the start of the war,"
00:15:36.990,00:15:38.640,"Germany, France, and Britain"
00:15:38.640,00:15:42.090,"all experimented with chemical weapons."
00:15:42.090,00:15:44.520,"Haber converted his wing of the institute"
00:15:44.520,00:15:46.890,"into a chemical weapons laboratory"
00:15:46.890,00:15:49.050,"and after only a few months of work,"
00:15:49.050,00:15:52.410,"he zeroed in on chlorine gas."
00:15:52.410,00:15:53.850,"An employee, Otto Hahn,"
00:15:53.850,00:15:56.790,"expressed his discomfort about the new weapon."
00:15:56.790,00:16:00.570,"Haber told him, ""Innumerable human lives would be saved"
00:16:00.570,00:16:03.766,"if the war could be ended more quickly in this way."""
00:16:03.766,00:16:06.349,"(somber music)"

00:16:13.170,00:16:16.710,"German troops released 168 tons of chlorine"

00:16:21.030,00:16:24.990,"The wall of gas advanced across the battlefield."
00:16:24.990,00:16:28.740,"Since chlorine gas is 2 1/2 times heavier than air,"
00:16:28.740,00:16:32.073,"it sank into the trenches of the Allied soldiers."
00:16:33.000,00:16:36.330,"Any soldier that inhaled a lung full of the gas"
00:16:36.330,00:16:38.880,"suffered a terrible death."

00:17:08.580,00:17:12.360,"researching chemical weapons, gas masks, and pesticides."
00:17:12.360,00:17:15.870,"By 1917, the institute employed 1,500 people"

00:17:18.240,00:17:20.730,"It was like a mini Manhattan project"

00:17:41.400,00:17:45.060,"he tried to distill gold from seawater"
00:17:45.060,00:17:46.863,"but the project was futile."
00:17:48.210,00:17:50.700,"In 1933, the Nazis came to power"
00:17:50.700,00:17:53.430,"and passed a law that all Jewish civil servants"
00:17:53.430,00:17:56.673,"including scientists, were to be fired from their jobs."
00:17:58.110,00:18:01.950,"Haber was Jewish but he never practiced the religion."
00:18:01.950,00:18:05.280,"Regardless, his military service exempted him from the law"
00:18:05.280,00:18:07.200,"but he resigned from his role as director"

00:18:30.990,00:18:35.190,"Haber's Institute developed a cyanide-based insecticide."
00:18:35.190,00:18:37.860,"It had a barely detectable odor"
00:18:37.860,00:18:40.650,"so, they mixed in a foul-smelling chemical"
00:18:40.650,00:18:43.260,"to alert people to the danger."
00:18:43.260,00:18:47.160,"The resulting gas was called Zyklon B."

00:18:51.810,00:18:54.120,"the foul-smelling component"
00:18:54.120,00:18:56.610,"and this form of Zyklon B,"
00:18:56.610,00:18:59.730,"the chemical developed at Haber's Institute"
00:18:59.730,00:19:03.594,"was then used to perpetrate the Holocaust."
00:19:03.594,00:19:06.511,"(slow tense music)"
00:19:09.120,00:19:11.220,"Thinking about this story,"
00:19:11.220,00:19:13.630,"it would be easy to paint Haber as a villain"
00:19:14.640,00:19:18.180,"or as a hero for inventing the process"
00:19:18.180,00:19:20.403,"used to feed half the world."
00:19:21.480,00:19:24.810,"But another approach is to regard him as"
00:19:24.810,00:19:27.540,"irrelevant to the larger story"
00:19:27.540,00:19:30.240,"because someone else would've figured out a way"
00:19:30.240,00:19:33.000,"to process nitrogen out of the air"
00:19:33.000,00:19:36.513,"and other scientists were developing chemical weapons."
00:19:37.530,00:19:39.360,"Over the past few centuries,"
00:19:39.360,00:19:44.340,"science and technology have improved our lives immeasurably"
00:19:44.340,00:19:47.940,"but they have also given us ever increasing ways"
00:19:47.940,00:19:50.340,"to destroy ourselves."
00:19:50.340,00:19:51.600,"I think it'd be great to believe"
00:19:51.600,00:19:55.710,"that we could ask scientists to only work on problems"
00:19:55.710,00:19:57.750,"that are good for humanity."
00:19:57.750,00:20:00.720,"But the reality is that every bit of information"
00:20:00.720,00:20:03.390,"is a potential double-edged sword."
00:20:03.390,00:20:05.970,"You don't know the outcome of your research"
00:20:05.970,00:20:09.000,"or how it might later be used."
00:20:09.000,00:20:13.653,"Ammonium nitrate is both a fertilizer and an explosive."
00:20:14.910,00:20:17.580,"So the real question is"
00:20:17.580,00:20:20.040,"how do we keep increasing our knowledge"
00:20:20.040,00:20:23.310,"and control of the natural world"
00:20:23.310,00:20:24.990,"without destroying ourselves"
00:20:24.990,00:20:28.083,"and everything else on this planet in the process?"
