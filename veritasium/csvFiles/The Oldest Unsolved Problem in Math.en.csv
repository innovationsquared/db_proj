00:00:00.093,00:00:03.810,"- This is a video about the oldest unsolved problem in math"
00:00:03.810,00:00:06.090,"that dates back 2000 years."
00:00:06.090,00:00:08.430,"Some of the brightest mathematicians of all time"
00:00:08.430,00:00:11.583,"have tried to crack it, but all of them failed."
00:00:13.800,00:00:14.790,"In the year 2000"
00:00:14.790,00:00:18.000,"the Italian mathematician, Piergiorgio Odifreddi,"
00:00:18.000,00:00:21.420,"listed it among four of the most pressing open problems"
00:00:21.420,00:00:22.680,"at the time."
00:00:22.680,00:00:24.570,"Solving this problem could be as simple"
00:00:24.570,00:00:26.970,"as finding a single number."
00:00:26.970,00:00:28.830,"So mathematicians have used computers"
00:00:28.830,00:00:33.360,"and checked numbers up to 10 to the power of 2,200,"
00:00:33.360,00:00:36.360,"but so far they've come up empty handed."
00:00:36.360,00:00:39.030,"Why do you think this problem has captured the imaginations"
00:00:39.030,00:00:41.280,"of so many mathematicians?"
00:00:41.280,00:00:44.193,"- It's old, it's simple,"
00:00:45.240,00:00:46.503,"it's beautiful."
00:00:47.880,00:00:49.310,"- What else could you want?"
00:00:49.310,00:00:51.210,"So the problem is this."
00:00:51.210,00:00:55.500,"Do any odd perfect numbers exist?"
00:00:55.500,00:00:57.723,"So what is a perfect number?"
00:00:58.890,00:01:00.960,"Well take the number six for example."
00:01:00.960,00:01:05.580,"You can divide it by 1, 2, 3, and 6, but let's ignore 6"
00:01:05.580,00:01:07.380,"because that's the number itself,"
00:01:07.380,00:01:09.960,"and now we're left with just the proper divisors."
00:01:09.960,00:01:13.620,"If you add them all up, you find that they add to six,"
00:01:13.620,00:01:15.450,"which is the number itself."
00:01:15.450,00:01:18.480,"So numbers like this are called perfect."
00:01:18.480,00:01:21.420,"You can also try this with other numbers like 10."
00:01:21.420,00:01:24.450,"10 has the proper divisors one, two, and five."
00:01:24.450,00:01:26.910,"If you add those up, you only get eight."
00:01:26.910,00:01:29.730,"So 10 is not a perfect number."
00:01:29.730,00:01:32.190,"Now you can repeat this for all other numbers,"
00:01:32.190,00:01:35.370,"and what you find is that most numbers either overshoot"
00:01:35.370,00:01:38.490,"or undershoot between 1 and a 100,"
00:01:38.490,00:01:42.210,"only 6 and 28 are perfect numbers."
00:01:42.210,00:01:43.380,"Go up to 10,000"
00:01:43.380,00:01:48.380,"and you find the next two perfect numbers 496 and 8,128."
00:01:51.270,00:01:53.910,"These were the only perfect numbers known"
00:01:53.910,00:01:55.200,"by the ancient Greeks,"
00:01:55.200,00:01:57.240,"and they would be the only known ones"
00:01:57.240,00:01:59.280,"for over a thousand years."
00:01:59.280,00:02:02.610,"If only we could find a pattern that makes these numbers,"
00:02:02.610,00:02:05.940,"then we could use that to predict more of them."
00:02:05.940,00:02:08.460,"So what do these numbers have in common?"
00:02:08.460,00:02:09.900,"Well, one thing to notice is"
00:02:09.900,00:02:13.620,"that each next perfect number is one digit longer"
00:02:13.620,00:02:15.870,"than the number that came before it."
00:02:15.870,00:02:18.960,"Another thing they share is that the ending digit alternates"
00:02:18.960,00:02:23.960,"between 6 and 8, which also means they are all even."
00:02:27.690,00:02:30.330,"But here's where things get really weird."
00:02:30.330,00:02:35.160,"You can write 6 as the sum of 1 plus 2 plus 3"
00:02:35.160,00:02:39.570,"and 28 as the sum of one, plus 2, plus 3,"
00:02:39.570,00:02:43.740,"plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 7, and so on"
00:02:43.740,00:02:48.030,"for the others as well, they're all just the sum"
00:02:48.030,00:02:50.070,"of consecutive numbers"
00:02:50.070,00:02:51.810,"and you can think of each additional number"
00:02:51.810,00:02:53.280,"as adding a new layer."
00:02:53.280,00:02:55.620,"And so these create a triangle,"
00:02:55.620,00:02:58.650,"which is why these numbers are called triangular numbers."
00:02:58.650,00:03:01.800,"Also, every number except for six is the sum"
00:03:01.800,00:03:04.230,"of consecutive odd cubes."
00:03:04.230,00:03:07.170,"So 28 is 1 cubed plus 3 cubed."
00:03:07.170,00:03:09.150,"496 is equal"
00:03:09.150,00:03:13.200,"to 1 cubed plus 3 cubed plus 5 cubed plus 7 cubed."
00:03:13.200,00:03:16.560,"And 8,128 is equal"
00:03:16.560,00:03:19.080,"to 1 cubed plus 3 cubed plus 5 cubed plus 7 cubed"
00:03:19.080,00:03:22.290,"plus 9 cubed all the way up to 15 cubed."
00:03:22.290,00:03:25.080,"But here's the one that really blows my mind."
00:03:25.080,00:03:27.360,"If you write these numbers in binary,"
00:03:27.360,00:03:30.690,"six becomes 110,"
00:03:30.690,00:03:34.833,"and 28 becomes 11100."
00:03:36.205,00:03:38.880,"496 becomes"
00:03:38.880,00:03:42.660,"111110000."
00:03:42.660,00:03:46.170,"And 8,128, you guessed it."
00:03:46.170,00:03:51.170,"It is also a string of ones followed by a series of zeros."
00:03:51.330,00:03:52.800,"So if you write them out,"
00:03:52.800,00:03:56.463,"they are all just consecutive powers of two."
00:04:03.405,00:04:05.280,"What now around 300 BC"
00:04:05.280,00:04:07.770,"Euclid was actually thinking along similar lines"
00:04:07.770,00:04:08.940,"when he discovered the pattern"
00:04:08.940,00:04:11.400,"that makes these perfect numbers."
00:04:11.400,00:04:13.350,"Take the number one and double it,"
00:04:13.350,00:04:15.420,"you get two now, keep doubling it."
00:04:15.420,00:04:20.100,"You get 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on."
00:04:20.100,00:04:22.860,"Now starting from one, add the next number to it."
00:04:22.860,00:04:25.380,"So 1 plus 2 equals 3."
00:04:25.380,00:04:28.110,"If that adds up to a prime, then you multiply it"
00:04:28.110,00:04:31.050,"by the last number in the sequence to get a perfect number."
00:04:31.050,00:04:35.190,"So two times three equals six, the first perfect number."
00:04:35.190,00:04:36.480,"Now let's keep doing this."
00:04:36.480,00:04:38.250,"Add 1 plus 2 plus 4,"
00:04:38.250,00:04:41.160,"and you get 7, which is again prime."
00:04:41.160,00:04:45.090,"So multiply it by the last number four, and you get 28."
00:04:45.090,00:04:46.830,"The next perfect number."
00:04:46.830,00:04:51.120,"Next, add 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 8 equals 15,"
00:04:51.120,00:04:56.120,"but 15 isn't prime, so we continue add 16 to get 31,"
00:04:56.130,00:04:57.450,"this is prime."
00:04:57.450,00:05:01.110,"So you multiply it by 16 and you get 496."
00:05:01.110,00:05:02.763,"The third perfect number."
00:05:03.900,00:05:06.030,"Now you can keep doing this to find bigger"
00:05:06.030,00:05:07.980,"and bigger perfect numbers,"
00:05:07.980,00:05:10.950,"and using this we can rewrite the first three."
00:05:10.950,00:05:14.910,"So 6 equals 1 plus 2 times 2 to the power of 1"
00:05:14.910,00:05:18.780,"and 28 equals 1 plus 2 plus 4 times 2 squared"
00:05:18.780,00:05:22.560,"and 496 equals 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 8"
00:05:22.560,00:05:25.170,"plus 16 times 2 to the power of 4"
00:05:25.170,00:05:27.780,"where the first term is prime."
00:05:27.780,00:05:30.630,"But there's a more convenient way to write this still."
00:05:30.630,00:05:33.750,"Take any sum of consecutive powers of 2."
00:05:33.750,00:05:35.439,"So 2 to the power of zero which is"
00:05:35.439,00:05:38.070,"1 plus 2 to the 1 plus 2 to the 2,"
00:05:38.070,00:05:40.800,"all the way up to 2 to the n minus 1."
00:05:40.800,00:05:43.410,"And now because you don't know n, you don't know what"
00:05:43.410,00:05:46.200,"that is equal to, but it will be equal to something."
00:05:46.200,00:05:47.970,"So let's call that T."
00:05:47.970,00:05:50.610,"Now multiply this whole equation by two."
00:05:50.610,00:05:52.680,"So you get 2 to the 1 plus 2 to the 2,"
00:05:52.680,00:05:57.480,"all the way up to 2 to the n, and this is equal to 2T."
00:05:57.480,00:06:00.180,"If you now subtract the first equation from the second,"
00:06:00.180,00:06:02.250,"almost all the terms will cancel out"
00:06:02.250,00:06:06.810,"and you're left with T equals 2 to the n minus 1."
00:06:06.810,00:06:09.030,"So you can replace this whole series"
00:06:09.030,00:06:12.240,"with one less than the next power of 2."
00:06:12.240,00:06:16.200,"So six becomes 2 squared minus 1 times 2 to the 1."
00:06:16.200,00:06:19.650,"28 becomes 2 cubed minus 1 times 2 squared,"
00:06:19.650,00:06:24.303,"and 496 becomes 2 to the 5 minus 1 times 2 to the 4."
00:06:25.290,00:06:26.463,"Do you see the pattern?"
00:06:27.300,00:06:29.820,"This number is always one more than this."
00:06:29.820,00:06:32.610,"So if we call this P, then Euclid formula"
00:06:32.610,00:06:36.480,"that gives a perfect number is 2 to the P minus 1"
00:06:36.480,00:06:40.563,"times 2 to the P minus 1 whenever this is prime."
00:06:42.150,00:06:44.940,"Now, because you're multiplying it by 2 to the P minus 1,"
00:06:44.940,00:06:48.693,"which is even, this will always give an even number."
00:06:50.790,00:06:54.600,"Euclid had found a way to generate even perfect numbers,"
00:06:54.600,00:06:57.810,"but he didn't prove that this was the only way."
00:06:57.810,00:07:00.360,"So there could be other ways to get perfect numbers,"
00:07:00.360,00:07:03.183,"including potentially ones that are odd."
00:07:04.230,00:07:05.430,"400 years later,"
00:07:05.430,00:07:07.710,"the Greek philosopher nicomchaus published"
00:07:07.710,00:07:11.100,"Introdutio Arithmetica, the standard arithmetic text"
00:07:11.100,00:07:13.260,"for the next thousand years."
00:07:13.260,00:07:16.530,"In it, he stated five conjectures statements he believed"
00:07:16.530,00:07:19.833,"to be true, but did not bother actually trying to prove."
00:07:20.850,00:07:23.070,"His conjectures were one,"
00:07:23.070,00:07:26.220,"the nth perfect number has n digits."
00:07:26.220,00:07:29.220,"Two, all perfect numbers are even."
00:07:29.220,00:07:33.750,"Three, all perfect numbers end in 6 and 8 alternately."
00:07:33.750,00:07:37.920,"Four, Euclid algorithm produces every even perfect number."
00:07:37.920,00:07:42.150,"And five, there are infinitely many perfect numbers."
00:07:42.150,00:07:43.770,"For the next thousand years"
00:07:43.770,00:07:47.430,"no one could prove or disprove any of these conjectures,"
00:07:47.430,00:07:49.443,"and they were considered facts."
00:07:51.840,00:07:53.220,"But in the 13th century,"
00:07:53.220,00:07:55.050,"Egyptian mathematician Ibn Fallus"
00:07:55.050,00:07:57.330,"published a list with 10 perfect numbers"
00:07:57.330,00:07:59.580,"and their values of P."
00:07:59.580,00:08:01.620,"Three of these perfect numbers turned out"
00:08:01.620,00:08:03.600,"not to be perfect at all."
00:08:03.600,00:08:05.520,"But the remaining ones are."
00:08:05.520,00:08:08.760,"The fifth perfect number is eight digits long,"
00:08:08.760,00:08:12.270,"which disproves Nicomachus's first conjecture."
00:08:12.270,00:08:14.400,"And the next thing to notice is that both the fifth"
00:08:14.400,00:08:17.130,"and sixth perfect number end in a 6."
00:08:17.130,00:08:19.770,"So that disproves Nicomachus's third conjecture"
00:08:19.770,00:08:23.670,"that all perfect numbers end in a 6 or 8 alternately."
00:08:23.670,00:08:25.740,"Two conjectures were proven false."
00:08:25.740,00:08:27.453,"But what about the other three?"
00:08:29.490,00:08:32.520,"Two centuries later, the problem reached Renaissance Europe"
00:08:32.520,00:08:34.440,"where they rediscovered the fifth, sixth,"
00:08:34.440,00:08:36.183,"and seventh perfect numbers."
00:08:37.950,00:08:41.100,"So far every perfect number had Euclid's form."
00:08:41.100,00:08:43.680,"And the best way to find new ones was by finding the values"
00:08:43.680,00:08:47.670,"of P that make 2 to the P minus 1 prime."
00:08:47.670,00:08:51.030,"So French polymath Marin Mersenne extensively studied"
00:08:51.030,00:08:53.250,"numbers of this form."
00:08:53.250,00:08:56.400,"In 1644, he published his in a book"
00:08:56.400,00:08:58.200,"including a list of 11 values"
00:08:58.200,00:09:01.890,"of P for which he claimed they corresponded to primes."
00:09:01.890,00:09:03.450,"Numbers for which this is true"
00:09:03.450,00:09:06.210,"are now called Mersenne Primes."
00:09:06.210,00:09:08.700,"Of his list the first seven exponents of P"
00:09:08.700,00:09:10.290,"do result in primes"
00:09:10.290,00:09:13.050,"and they correspond to the first seven perfect numbers."
00:09:13.050,00:09:14.640,"But for some of the larger numbers"
00:09:14.640,00:09:17.760,"like 2 to the 67 minus 1, Mersenne admitted"
00:09:17.760,00:09:20.617,"to not even checking whether they were prime."
00:09:20.617,00:09:24.000,"""To tell if a given number of 15 to 20 digits is prime"
00:09:24.000,00:09:27.507,"or not all time would not suffice for the test."""
00:09:30.150,00:09:32.310,"Mersenne discussed the problem of perfect numbers"
00:09:32.310,00:09:33.930,"with other luminaries of the time,"
00:09:33.930,00:09:36.750,"including Pierre de Fermat and Rene Descartes."
00:09:36.750,00:09:40.530,"In 1638, Descartes wrote to Mersenne, I think I can show"
00:09:40.530,00:09:42.450,"that there are no even perfect numbers"
00:09:42.450,00:09:44.670,"except those of Euclid."
00:09:44.670,00:09:48.180,"He also believed that if an odd perfect number does exist,"
00:09:48.180,00:09:50.490,"it must have a special form."
00:09:50.490,00:09:52.650,"It must be the product of a prime"
00:09:52.650,00:09:55.050,"and the square of a different number."
00:09:55.050,00:09:57.300,"If he was right, these would easily have been"
00:09:57.300,00:09:59.850,"the biggest breakthroughs on the problem since Euclid"
00:09:59.850,00:10:01.350,"2000 years earlier."
00:10:01.350,00:10:04.290,"But Descartes couldn't prove either of those statements."
00:10:04.290,00:10:07.710,"Instead, he wrote ""As for me, I judge that one can find"
00:10:07.710,00:10:09.990,"real odd perfect numbers."
00:10:09.990,00:10:13.050,"But whatever method you use, it takes a long time"
00:10:13.050,00:10:14.307,"to look for these."""
00:10:15.480,00:10:18.300,"Around a hundred years later at the St. petersburg Academy,"
00:10:18.300,00:10:21.000,"the Prussian mathematician Christian Goldbach"
00:10:21.000,00:10:23.850,"met a 20-year-old math prodigy."
00:10:23.850,00:10:26.460,"The two stayed in touch corresponding by mail,"
00:10:26.460,00:10:29.850,"and in 1729, Goldbach introduced this young man"
00:10:29.850,00:10:31.560,"to the work of Fermat."
00:10:31.560,00:10:33.420,"At first, he seemed indifferent,"
00:10:33.420,00:10:35.190,"but after a little more prodding by Goldbach"
00:10:35.190,00:10:37.440,"he became passionate about number theory"
00:10:37.440,00:10:39.270,"and he spent the next 40 years"
00:10:39.270,00:10:41.820,"working on different problems in the field"
00:10:41.820,00:10:45.090,"among them was the problem of perfect numbers."
00:10:45.090,00:10:47.613,"This Prodigy's name was Leonhard Euler."
00:10:48.750,00:10:51.090,"Euler picked up where Descartes had left off,"
00:10:51.090,00:10:52.680,"but with more success."
00:10:52.680,00:10:56.550,"In doing so, he made three breakthroughs on this problem."
00:10:56.550,00:10:58.380,"First in 1732,"
00:10:58.380,00:11:01.650,"he discovered the eighth perfect number, which he had done"
00:11:01.650,00:11:05.490,"by verifying that 2 to the 31 minus 1 is prime."
00:11:05.490,00:11:07.203,"Just as Mersenne had predicted."
00:11:09.480,00:11:12.600,"For his other two breakthroughs, he invented a new weapon,"
00:11:12.600,00:11:14.220,"the sigma function."
00:11:14.220,00:11:16.710,"All this function does is it takes all the divisors"
00:11:16.710,00:11:20.430,"of a number, including the number itself and adds them up."
00:11:20.430,00:11:24.630,"So take any number, say six, sum up all its divisors"
00:11:24.630,00:11:28.290,"and you get 12, which is twice the number we started with."
00:11:28.290,00:11:31.050,"And this will be true for all perfect numbers."
00:11:31.050,00:11:33.090,"The Sigma function of a perfect number"
00:11:33.090,00:11:35.550,"will always give twice the number itself"
00:11:35.550,00:11:37.830,"because the sigma function includes the number"
00:11:37.830,00:11:39.570,"as one of its divisors."
00:11:39.570,00:11:41.850,"Now this may seem like a small change,"
00:11:41.850,00:11:44.370,"but it ends up being extremely powerful."
00:11:44.370,00:11:47.220,"So let's look at a few examples."
00:11:47.220,00:11:49.380,"Take a prime number like seven."
00:11:49.380,00:11:50.490,"Now, because it's prime,"
00:11:50.490,00:11:53.010,"you can't rearrange it into a rectangle,"
00:11:53.010,00:11:56.670,"therefore the only divisors are one and the prime itself."
00:11:56.670,00:12:00.960,"So Sigma seven is 1 plus 7, which is equal to 8."
00:12:00.960,00:12:02.640,"Now, to keep things easier to follow,"
00:12:02.640,00:12:04.890,"we'll just stick to the numbers."
00:12:04.890,00:12:07.920,"But what if instead of seven, you had seven cubed?"
00:12:07.920,00:12:10.350,"Well, again, the sum of the divisors is really simple."
00:12:10.350,00:12:14.970,"It's just 1 plus 7 plus 7 squared plus 7 cubed."
00:12:14.970,00:12:17.970,"Now let's use it on a different number, say 20."
00:12:17.970,00:12:21.930,"The sum of its divisors is 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 5"
00:12:21.930,00:12:25.350,"plus 10 plus 20, which equals 42."
00:12:25.350,00:12:26.460,"But you can also write this"
00:12:26.460,00:12:30.270,"as 1 plus 2 plus 4 times 1 plus 5."
00:12:30.270,00:12:31.710,"And this is what really makes"
00:12:31.710,00:12:33.750,"the sigma function so powerful."
00:12:33.750,00:12:36.180,"If you have a number that is made up of other numbers"
00:12:36.180,00:12:37.980,"that don't share factors with each other,"
00:12:37.980,00:12:39.630,"then you can split up the sigma function"
00:12:39.630,00:12:41.820,"into the sigma functions of the prime powers"
00:12:41.820,00:12:43.080,"that make it up."
00:12:43.080,00:12:46.200,"So sigma of 2 squared times sigma 5"
00:12:46.200,00:12:48.420,"is equal to sigma 20."
00:12:48.420,00:12:50.820,"And since any number can be written as the product"
00:12:50.820,00:12:53.610,"of prime powers, you can split up the sigma function"
00:12:53.610,00:12:55.890,"of any composite number into the sigma functions"
00:12:55.890,00:12:57.393,"of its prime powers."
00:12:59.280,00:13:01.110,"With his new function in hand,"
00:13:01.110,00:13:02.970,"Euler achieved his second breakthrough"
00:13:02.970,00:13:04.770,"and did what Descartes couldn't."
00:13:04.770,00:13:09.120,"He proved that every even perfect number has Euclid's form."
00:13:09.120,00:13:13.620,"This Euclid-Euler theorem solved a 1600-year-old problem"
00:13:13.620,00:13:17.220,"and proved Nicomachus's fourth conjecture."
00:13:17.220,00:13:19.320,"Math historian William Dunham called it"
00:13:19.320,00:13:22.503,"the greatest mathematical collaboration in history."
00:13:23.760,00:13:25.680,"But Euler wasn't finished yet."
00:13:25.680,00:13:29.040,"He also wanted to solve the problem of odd perfect numbers."
00:13:29.040,00:13:30.930,"So for his third breakthrough, he set out"
00:13:30.930,00:13:33.210,"to prove Descartes other statement"
00:13:33.210,00:13:36.723,"that every odd perfect number must have a specific form."
00:13:37.710,00:13:40.290,"Because if an odd perfect number does exist,"
00:13:40.290,00:13:43.590,"you know two things first n is odd."
00:13:43.590,00:13:47.400,"And second sigma of n equals 2n."
00:13:47.400,00:13:49.860,"Now any number n, you can write as a product"
00:13:49.860,00:13:51.330,"of different prime numbers"
00:13:51.330,00:13:53.583,"and each prime can be to some power."
00:13:54.480,00:13:57.840,"So let's take that and put it into Euler sigma function."
00:13:57.840,00:14:02.160,"So you get sigma of n equals sigma of all of those primes"
00:14:02.160,00:14:05.160,"to their powers, which equals 2n."
00:14:05.160,00:14:07.500,"But since all of these factors are primes,"
00:14:07.500,00:14:10.080,"you can actually split up the sigma function into the sigmas"
00:14:10.080,00:14:12.480,"of the individual prime powers."
00:14:12.480,00:14:13.890,"Now one thing to notice is"
00:14:13.890,00:14:16.800,"that if you have a prime number raised to an odd power,"
00:14:16.800,00:14:18.900,"for example seven to the power of 1,"
00:14:18.900,00:14:21.120,"then the sigma function will be even"
00:14:21.120,00:14:23.880,"because 1 plus 7 equals 8,"
00:14:23.880,00:14:25.440,"you'll always get an even number"
00:14:25.440,00:14:28.320,"because odd plus odd is even"
00:14:28.320,00:14:29.970,"if the prime number is instead raised"
00:14:29.970,00:14:33.090,"to an even power like seven squared,"
00:14:33.090,00:14:36.000,"then the sigma function returns an odd number."
00:14:36.000,00:14:40.290,"Sigma of 7 squared equals 1 plus 7 plus 7 squared,"
00:14:40.290,00:14:42.240,"which equals 57."
00:14:42.240,00:14:46.080,"Because odd plus odd plus odd equals odd."
00:14:46.080,00:14:48.720,"So if you have the sigma function of an odd prime raised"
00:14:48.720,00:14:52.140,"to an odd power, it will give an even number."
00:14:52.140,00:14:54.540,"If instead it's raised to an even power,"
00:14:54.540,00:14:56.940,"you get an odd number."
00:14:56.940,00:15:00.360,"And this is where Euler's genius insight comes in"
00:15:00.360,00:15:04.080,"because here on the right side you've got 2 times n"
00:15:04.080,00:15:08.550,"where n is an odd perfect number, and 2 is even."
00:15:08.550,00:15:09.600,"Well, what that means is"
00:15:09.600,00:15:12.990,"that on the left side there must only be one even number"
00:15:12.990,00:15:14.700,"because if there were two even numbers,"
00:15:14.700,00:15:16.320,"you could factor out four."
00:15:16.320,00:15:18.180,"But that means you should also be able"
00:15:18.180,00:15:21.210,"to factor out four on the right side, which you can't"
00:15:21.210,00:15:25.560,"because n is odd and there's only a single 2 here."
00:15:25.560,00:15:29.970,"So only one of these sigmas here can give an even number,"
00:15:29.970,00:15:32.370,"which means that there is exactly one prime"
00:15:32.370,00:15:33.900,"that is to an odd power"
00:15:33.900,00:15:36.930,"and all the others must be to an even power"
00:15:36.930,00:15:39.003,"just as Descartes had predicted."
00:15:40.740,00:15:42.930,"Now, Euler refined the form a bit more"
00:15:42.930,00:15:45.630,"and showed that an odd perfect number must satisfy"
00:15:45.630,00:15:49.410,"this condition, but even Euler couldn't prove"
00:15:49.410,00:15:50.970,"whether they existed or not."
00:15:50.970,00:15:53.880,"He wrote ""Whether there are any odd perfect numbers"
00:15:53.880,00:15:56.970,"is a most difficult question."""
00:15:56.970,00:15:58.980,"For the next 150 years"
00:15:58.980,00:16:00.810,"very little progress was made"
00:16:00.810,00:16:04.080,"and no new perfect numbers were discovered."
00:16:04.080,00:16:06.210,"English mathematician Peter Barlow wrote"
00:16:06.210,00:16:08.940,"that Euler eighth perfect number ""Is the greatest"
00:16:08.940,00:16:10.590,"that ever will be discovered"
00:16:10.590,00:16:13.950,"for as they are merely curious without being useful,"
00:16:13.950,00:16:16.290,"it is not likely that any person will ever attempt"
00:16:16.290,00:16:17.937,"to find one beyond it."""
00:16:20.880,00:16:23.160,"But Barlow was wrong."
00:16:23.160,00:16:27.720,"Mathematicians kept pursuing these elusive perfect numbers"
00:16:27.720,00:16:31.710,"and most started with Mersenne's list of proposed primes."
00:16:31.710,00:16:35.220,"The next on his list was 2 to the 67 minus 1."
00:16:35.220,00:16:37.890,"So far, Mersenne had done an excellent job."
00:16:37.890,00:16:40.320,"He had included Euler's eighth perfect number"
00:16:40.320,00:16:42.660,"while avoiding others like 29"
00:16:42.660,00:16:45.450,"that turned out not to lead to a perfect number,"
00:16:45.450,00:16:48.750,"but 230 years after Mersenne published his list,"
00:16:48.750,00:16:53.610,"Edouard Lucas proved that 2 to the 67 minus 1 was not prime,"
00:16:53.610,00:16:56.043,"although he was unable to find its factors."
00:16:57.720,00:17:00.810,"27 years later, Frank Nelson Cole gave a talk"
00:17:00.810,00:17:04.230,"to the American mathematical society without saying a word,"
00:17:04.230,00:17:06.270,"he walked to one side of the blackboard"
00:17:06.270,00:17:09.832,"and wrote down 2 to the 67 minus 1 equals"
00:17:09.832,00:17:12.165,"147,573,952,589,676,412,927."
00:17:22.350,00:17:24.510,"He then walked to the other side of the blackboard"
00:17:24.510,00:17:29.510,"and multiplied 193,707,721 times"
00:17:30.544,00:17:31.794,"761,838,257,287"
00:17:36.570,00:17:38.760,"giving the same answer."
00:17:38.760,00:17:40.650,"He sat down without saying a word"
00:17:40.650,00:17:43.113,"and the audience erupted in applause."
00:17:44.100,00:17:46.440,"He later admitted it took him three years"
00:17:46.440,00:17:48.450,"working on Sundays to solve this."
00:17:48.450,00:17:51.753,"A modern computer could solve this in less than a second."
00:17:53.370,00:17:54.690,"From 500 BC"
00:17:54.690,00:17:58.890,"until 1952 people had discovered just 12 Mersenne primes"
00:17:58.890,00:18:01.800,"and therefore only 12 perfect numbers."
00:18:01.800,00:18:03.360,"The main difficulty was checking whether"
00:18:03.360,00:18:06.750,"large Mersenne numbers were actually prime."
00:18:06.750,00:18:08.100,"But in 1952,"
00:18:08.100,00:18:10.590,"American mathematician Raphael Robinson wrote"
00:18:10.590,00:18:12.870,"a computer program to perform this task"
00:18:12.870,00:18:17.870,"and he ran it on the fastest computer at the time, the SWAC."
00:18:18.000,00:18:21.540,"Within 10 months, he found the next five Mersenne primes"
00:18:21.540,00:18:24.150,"and so corresponding perfect numbers."
00:18:24.150,00:18:25.530,"And over the next 50 years,"
00:18:25.530,00:18:28.830,"new Mersenne primes were discovered in rapid succession,"
00:18:28.830,00:18:31.290,"all using computers."
00:18:31.290,00:18:34.140,"The largest Mersenne prime at the end of 1952"
00:18:34.140,00:18:38.160,"was 2 to the power of 2,281 minus 1,"
00:18:38.160,00:18:40.770,"which is 687 digits long."
00:18:40.770,00:18:42.930,"By the end of 1994, the largest Mersenne prime"
00:18:42.930,00:18:47.930,"was 2 to the power of 859,433 minus 1,"
00:18:48.060,00:18:53.060,"which is 258,716 digits long."
00:18:53.070,00:18:56.070,"Since these numbers were getting so astronomically large,"
00:18:56.070,00:18:58.560,"the task of finding numerous end primes became"
00:18:58.560,00:19:01.863,"more and more difficult even for supercomputers."
00:19:02.730,00:19:04.170,"So in 1996,"
00:19:04.170,00:19:06.390,"computer scientist George Woltman launched"
00:19:06.390,00:19:09.970,"the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search or GIMPS."
00:19:09.970,00:19:12.900,"GIMPS distributes the work over many computers"
00:19:12.900,00:19:15.060,"allowing anyone to volunteer their computer power"
00:19:15.060,00:19:17.550,"to help search for Mersenne primes."
00:19:17.550,00:19:20.070,"The project has been highly successful so far,"
00:19:20.070,00:19:23.250,"having discovered 17 new Mersenne primes,"
00:19:23.250,00:19:26.730,"15 of which were the largest known primes at that time."
00:19:26.730,00:19:29.310,"And the best part, if your computer discovers"
00:19:29.310,00:19:30.660,"a new Mersenne prime,"
00:19:30.660,00:19:33.030,"you'll be listed as its discoverer,"
00:19:33.030,00:19:34.950,"adding yourself to a list that includes"
00:19:34.950,00:19:37.830,"some of the best mathematicians of all time."
00:19:37.830,00:19:40.320,"There's even a $250,000 prize"
00:19:40.320,00:19:42.753,"for the first billion-digit prime."
00:19:45.930,00:19:49.050,"In 2017 Church Deacon John Pace discovered"
00:19:49.050,00:19:52.020,"the 50th Mersenne Prime by using GIMPS."
00:19:52.020,00:19:57.020,"The number 2 to the 77,232,917 minus 1"

00:20:10.357,00:20:13.440,"""The Largest Prime number of 2017."""
00:20:13.440,00:20:14.550,"And all it is"
00:20:14.550,00:20:19.533,"is that number spread over 719 glorious pages."
00:20:20.730,00:20:21.870,"It's wild."
00:20:21.870,00:20:25.110,"The size of this font is so tiny."
00:20:25.110,00:20:27.870,"The book quickly rose to the number one spot on Amazon"
00:20:27.870,00:20:30.183,"and sold out in four days."
00:20:31.140,00:20:34.950,"A year later, the 51st Mersenne Prime was discovered."
00:20:34.950,00:20:37.767,"It's 2 to the 82,589,933 minus 1,"
00:20:42.180,00:20:46.350,"and this number has 24,000,860 2048 digits."
00:20:49.140,00:20:51.750,"But there's something I enjoy about the absurdity,"
00:20:51.750,00:20:54.543,"like there is knowledge in here,"
00:20:56.130,00:20:57.360,"but it's not the kind of knowledge"
00:20:57.360,00:20:59.790,"that anyone's ever gonna read out of a book."
00:20:59.790,00:21:01.020,"But in some way it's nice"
00:21:01.020,00:21:02.460,"that there's this physical artifact"
00:21:02.460,00:21:03.903,"that like has the number,"
00:21:04.740,00:21:06.510,"if ever we lost all the prime numbers."
00:21:06.510,00:21:08.520,"You know, someone could find this book"
00:21:08.520,00:21:10.893,"be like, here's the big one."
00:21:11.880,00:21:15.870,"As of today, this is still the largest known prime."
00:21:15.870,00:21:18.660,"And since numbers of this form grow so rapidly,"
00:21:18.660,00:21:20.040,"the largest Mersenne Prime"
00:21:20.040,00:21:22.713,"is almost always the largest known prime."
00:21:24.870,00:21:27.060,"Computers have been incredibly successful"
00:21:27.060,00:21:28.680,"at finding new Mersenne primes"
00:21:28.680,00:21:31.290,"and their corresponding perfect numbers,"
00:21:31.290,00:21:35.190,"but we've still only found 51 so far."
00:21:35.190,00:21:36.960,"So you might suspect that there are"
00:21:36.960,00:21:38.910,"only a finite number of them,"
00:21:38.910,00:21:41.430,"which would mean that Nicomachus's fifth conjecture"
00:21:41.430,00:21:42.360,"would be false,"
00:21:42.360,00:21:45.393,"that there aren't infinitely many perfect numbers,"
00:21:46.230,00:21:48.510,"but that might not be the case."
00:21:48.510,00:21:51.600,"The Lenstra and Pomerance Wagstaff conjecture predicts"
00:21:51.600,00:21:53.790,"how many Mersenne primes should appear"
00:21:53.790,00:21:55.980,"based on how large P is."
00:21:55.980,00:21:58.650,"Now this is the actual data"
00:21:58.650,00:22:01.140,"the conjecture performs remarkably well."
00:22:01.140,00:22:02.970,"But more importantly, it predicts"
00:22:02.970,00:22:05.460,"that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes"
00:22:05.460,00:22:08.610,"and so infinitely many even perfect numbers."
00:22:08.610,00:22:11.520,"The Mersenne primes are just so large and rare"
00:22:11.520,00:22:14.883,"that they take a lot of time and computer resources to find."
00:22:17.010,00:22:19.140,"But a conjecture is not a proof."
00:22:19.140,00:22:21.960,"And up until this day, this problem shares"
00:22:21.960,00:22:24.270,"the title of oldest unsolved problem in math"
00:22:24.270,00:22:26.040,"with the other open problem."
00:22:26.040,00:22:28.803,"Do any odd perfect numbers exist?"
00:22:30.570,00:22:32.640,"The easiest way to solve this problem"
00:22:32.640,00:22:34.440,"is by finding an example."
00:22:34.440,00:22:37.470,"So maybe we could just check different odd numbers"
00:22:37.470,00:22:40.560,"and see if one of them is perfect."
00:22:40.560,00:22:43.770,"That's exactly what researchers tried in 1991."
00:22:43.770,00:22:46.560,"By using a smart algorithm called a factor chain,"
00:22:46.560,00:22:48.750,"they were able to show that if an odd perfect number"
00:22:48.750,00:22:51.210,"does exist, it must be larger than 10"
00:22:51.210,00:22:53.070,"to the power of 300."
00:22:53.070,00:22:56.400,"21 years later, Pascal Ochem and Michael Rao"
00:22:56.400,00:23:00.180,"raised that lower bound to 10 to the 1,500"
00:23:00.180,00:23:02.640,"with recent progress pushing that number up to 10"
00:23:02.640,00:23:04.263,"to the 2,200."
00:23:05.220,00:23:06.810,"With numbers that large,"
00:23:06.810,00:23:10.260,"it's unlikely that a computer will find one anytime soon."
00:23:10.260,00:23:12.780,"So we'll need to get smart."
00:23:12.780,00:23:13.800,"What would a proof look like?"
00:23:13.800,00:23:15.990,"Like how could we actually prove this?"
00:23:15.990,00:23:19.050,"- I think the main idea that people have been trying"
00:23:19.050,00:23:21.270,"to approach this problem with is coming up with"
00:23:21.270,00:23:22.620,"more and more conditions"
00:23:22.620,00:23:26.520,"odd perfect numbers have to satisfy, it's called this web"
00:23:26.520,00:23:30.810,"of conditions where it has to have 10 prime factors now"
00:23:30.810,00:23:33.390,"that we know and maybe thousands"
00:23:33.390,00:23:35.100,"of non distinct prime factors"
00:23:35.100,00:23:37.650,"and has to be bigger than 10 to the 3000."
00:23:37.650,00:23:40.710,"And it has to do all these different things"
00:23:40.710,00:23:43.950,"and we hope that eventually there's just so many conditions"
00:23:43.950,00:23:47.250,"that can strain the numbers so much that they can't exist."
00:23:47.250,00:23:49.800,"- Since Euler, mathematicians have kept adding new"
00:23:49.800,00:23:51.840,"conditions to this web."
00:23:51.840,00:23:53.823,"- But so far it hasn't worked."
00:23:55.050,00:23:57.150,"- But there might be another path."
00:23:57.150,00:23:59.460,"When Descartes was looking for odd perfect numbers,"
00:23:59.460,00:24:03.783,"he came across 198,585,576,189,"
00:24:06.480,00:24:09.660,"which you can factor as 3 squared times 7 squared"
00:24:09.660,00:24:14.660,"times 11 squared times 13 squared times 22021."
00:24:15.300,00:24:17.040,"Put this into Euler sigma function"
00:24:17.040,00:24:20.850,"and you find it is equal to two times the original number."
00:24:20.850,00:24:23.250,"In other words, it is perfect."
00:24:23.250,00:24:28.250,"That is if 22021 were prime, but it's not"
00:24:28.290,00:24:31.800,"because it is equal to 19 squared times 61."
00:24:31.800,00:24:34.980,"And filling that in shows that it is not perfect."
00:24:34.980,00:24:36.990,"Numbers like this that are very close"
00:24:36.990,00:24:40.530,"to being odd perfect numbers are called spoofs."
00:24:40.530,00:24:43.590,"Spoofs are a larger group of numbers."
00:24:43.590,00:24:47.070,"So odd perfect numbers share all properties of spoofs"
00:24:47.070,00:24:48.900,"and then a few extra ones."
00:24:48.900,00:24:51.270,"And the goal is to find properties of spoofs"
00:24:51.270,00:24:54.393,"that ultimately prevent them from being odd perfect numbers."
00:24:55.320,00:24:56.580,"For example, one condition"
00:24:56.580,00:25:01.170,"of odd perfect numbers is that they can't be divided by 105."
00:25:01.170,00:25:04.890,"So if you find that spoofs must be divisible by 105,"
00:25:04.890,00:25:05.940,"then this would prove"
00:25:05.940,00:25:08.640,"that odd perfect numbers can't exist."
00:25:08.640,00:25:12.000,"In 2022 Pace Nielsen and a team at BYU"
00:25:12.000,00:25:15.840,"found 21 spoof numbers including Descartes number,"
00:25:15.840,00:25:18.690,"and while they discovered some new properties of spoofs,"
00:25:18.690,00:25:23.100,"they didn't find any that rule out odd, perfect numbers."
00:25:23.100,00:25:26.763,"So how large would an odd perfect number have to be?"
00:25:27.720,00:25:28.670,"- They don't exist."
00:25:29.700,00:25:31.670,"- You don't think odd perfect numbers exist?"
00:25:31.670,00:25:34.413,"- No, they don't exist."
00:25:36.120,00:25:36.953,"I wish they did."
00:25:36.953,00:25:38.790,"That'd be really cool if if there was just"
00:25:38.790,00:25:42.540,"this one gigantic odd, perfect number out in the universe."
00:25:42.540,00:25:44.820,"They don't exist. No."
00:25:44.820,00:25:47.850,"- How are you convinced that they don't exist?"
00:25:47.850,00:25:51.270,"- There is something called a heuristic argument"
00:25:51.270,00:25:53.640,"where it's not a proof."
00:25:53.640,00:25:55.770,"So if we had a proof, we'd be done."
00:25:55.770,00:25:58.290,"It's just an argument from, okay,"
00:25:58.290,00:26:02.310,"we think primes occur this often of this type."
00:26:02.310,00:26:05.130,"And you put that those pieces of information together"
00:26:05.130,00:26:07.380,"and you think, okay, on average"
00:26:07.380,00:26:09.780,"how many numbers should be perfect."
00:26:09.780,00:26:12.720,"- This argument, which was made by Carl Pomerance predicts"
00:26:12.720,00:26:14.910,"that between 10 to the 2,200"
00:26:14.910,00:26:17.550,"and infinity, there are no more than 10"
00:26:17.550,00:26:20.570,"to the negative 540 perfect numbers"
00:26:20.570,00:26:23.350,"of the form N equals pm squared"
00:26:24.570,00:26:25.800,"- With odd perfect numbers"
00:26:25.800,00:26:30.030,"the heuristic says we shouldn't expect any."
00:26:30.030,00:26:33.540,"We've searched high enough now that we think"
00:26:33.540,00:26:36.660,"we have enough evidence they shouldn't exist anymore."
00:26:36.660,00:26:40.440,"- My understanding is this heuristic argument."
00:26:40.440,00:26:41.820,"It also predicts"
00:26:41.820,00:26:46.083,"that there are no large perfect numbers even or odd."
00:26:46.920,00:26:48.750,"So..."
00:26:48.750,00:26:49.713,"That's true."
00:26:51.660,00:26:53.310,"So there's a downside."
00:26:53.310,00:26:54.630,"Yeah, there's a downside"
00:26:54.630,00:26:57.510,"because it says there shouldn't be large,"
00:26:57.510,00:26:59.790,"even perfect numbers and we actually expect there"
00:26:59.790,00:27:01.320,"to be infinitely many."
00:27:01.320,00:27:03.780,"And so, okay, so..."
00:27:03.780,00:27:05.670,"why do I believe the heuristic in this case"
00:27:05.670,00:27:06.503,"and not this case?"
00:27:06.503,00:27:07.800,"You're right."
00:27:07.800,00:27:09.990,"Am I being hypocritical about that?"
00:27:09.990,00:27:12.390,"There are other aspects you can add on"
00:27:12.390,00:27:14.130,"to the heuristic and make it stronger."
00:27:14.130,00:27:15.240,"Let me put it that way."
00:27:15.240,00:27:17.340,"But you're right, it's not a proof."
00:27:17.340,00:27:21.690,"- For now this is still the oldest unsolved problem in math."
00:27:21.690,00:27:24.450,"Euler was right when he said whether there are"
00:27:24.450,00:27:28.083,"any odd perfect numbers is a most difficult question."
00:27:29.130,00:27:32.880,"So are there any applications of this problem?"
00:27:32.880,00:27:35.643,"- I can say no."
00:27:37.560,00:27:38.910,"- Now, many people may think"
00:27:38.910,00:27:41.550,"that if there are no applications to the real world,"
00:27:41.550,00:27:44.190,"then there's no point studying it."
00:27:44.190,00:27:48.150,"Why should anyone care about some old unsolved problem?"
00:27:48.150,00:27:50.250,"But I think that's the wrong approach."
00:27:50.250,00:27:51.780,"For more than 2000 years,"
00:27:51.780,00:27:54.660,"number theory had no real world applications."
00:27:54.660,00:27:57.420,"It was just mathematicians following their curiosity"
00:27:57.420,00:27:59.941,"and solving problems they found interesting proving"
00:27:59.941,00:28:01.710,"one result after another"
00:28:01.710,00:28:04.890,"and building a foundation of useless mathematics."
00:28:04.890,00:28:07.530,"But then in the 20th century, we realized"
00:28:07.530,00:28:09.450,"that we could take this foundation"
00:28:09.450,00:28:11.730,"and base our cryptography on it."
00:28:11.730,00:28:14.340,"This is what protects everything from text messages"
00:28:14.340,00:28:16.050,"to government secrets."
00:28:16.050,00:28:17.250,"- Whenever you have a group"
00:28:17.250,00:28:20.880,"of people put their minds towards a problem,"
00:28:20.880,00:28:22.620,"something good's gonna come out of it."
00:28:22.620,00:28:25.320,"If it's only, if it's only at the beginning,"
00:28:25.320,00:28:26.790,"this doesn't work."
00:28:26.790,00:28:31.050,"Okay, well, as Edison said, I learned 999 ways"
00:28:31.050,00:28:32.460,"of not making a light bulb."
00:28:32.460,00:28:35.190,"Eventually I got a good way to do it."
00:28:35.190,00:28:36.640,"It's the same with math."
00:28:36.640,00:28:38.550,"You have a problem"
00:28:38.550,00:28:40.590,"and you throw your mind at it and others do too."
00:28:40.590,00:28:41.940,"And you come up with new ideas"
00:28:41.940,00:28:45.480,"and eventually something good comes from that process."
00:28:45.480,00:28:47.340,"- Einstein's general relativity was built"
00:28:47.340,00:28:50.820,"on non-Euclidean geometries, geometries that were developed"
00:28:50.820,00:28:53.820,"as intellectual curiosities without foresight"
00:28:53.820,00:28:55.260,"of how they would one day change"
00:28:55.260,00:28:57.390,"the way we understand the universe."
00:28:57.390,00:29:00.300,"How many people do you think are working on the problem"
00:29:00.300,00:29:02.190,"of perfect numbers right now?"
00:29:02.190,00:29:06.210,"- I'd guess around 10 people currently"
00:29:06.210,00:29:08.910,"have papers in the area, 10 to 15."
00:29:08.910,00:29:12.180,"If you're a high schooler and you just love mathematics"
00:29:12.180,00:29:14.670,"and you think, I want a problem to think about,"
00:29:14.670,00:29:16.170,"this one's a great problem to think about."
00:29:16.170,00:29:19.470,"And you can make progress. You can figure out new things."
00:29:19.470,00:29:21.210,"Yeah, don't be scared."
00:29:21.210,00:29:23.430,"Hundreds of people have thought about this problem"
00:29:23.430,00:29:25.680,"for thousands of years."
00:29:25.680,00:29:29.430,"What can I do? You can do something."
00:29:29.430,00:29:31.500,"- Why should you do math if you don't know"
00:29:31.500,00:29:33.240,"that it will lead anywhere?"
00:29:33.240,00:29:35.580,"Well, because doing the math is the only way"
00:29:35.580,00:29:37.380,"to know for sure."
