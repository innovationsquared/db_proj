00:00:00.230,00:00:02.780,"- This video is about the ridiculous way"
00:00:02.780,00:00:04.650,"we used to calculate Pi."
00:00:04.650,00:00:07.720,"For 2000 years the most successful method"
00:00:07.720,00:00:10.790,"was painstakingly slow and tedious,"
00:00:10.790,00:00:14.000,"but then Isaac Newton came along and changed the game."
00:00:14.000,00:00:16.020,"You could say he speed-ran Pi"
00:00:16.020,00:00:18.010,"and I'm gonna show you how he did it."
00:00:18.010,00:00:20.603,"But first Pi with pizzas."
00:00:25.290,00:00:27.000,"Cut the crust off of pizza"
00:00:27.000,00:00:29.970,"and lay it across identical pizzas."
00:00:29.970,00:00:34.740,"And you'll find that it goes across three and a bit pizzas,"
00:00:34.740,00:00:36.010,"this is Pi."
00:00:36.010,00:00:39.640,"The circumference of a circle is roughly 3.14 times"
00:00:39.640,00:00:44.360,"its diameter but Pi is also related to a circles area,"
00:00:44.360,00:00:46.140,"area's just Pi R squared."
00:00:46.140,00:00:48.800,"But why is it Pi R squared?"
00:00:48.800,00:00:52.460,"Well cut a pizza into really thin slices"
00:00:52.460,00:00:55.620,"and then form these slices into a rectangle."
00:00:55.620,00:00:58.910,"Now the area of this rectangle is just length times width."
00:00:58.910,00:01:02.030,"The length of the rectangle is half the circumference"
00:01:02.030,00:01:03.720,"because there's half the crust on one side"
00:01:03.720,00:01:05.120,"and half on the other,"
00:01:05.120,00:01:07.380,"so the length is Pi R."
00:01:07.380,00:01:10.330,"And then the width is just the length of a piece of pizza"
00:01:10.330,00:01:13.090,"which is the radius of the original circle."
00:01:13.090,00:01:15.890,"So area is Pi R times R,"
00:01:15.890,00:01:18.780,"area is Pi R squared."
00:01:18.780,00:01:22.560,"So the area of a unit circle then is just Pi,"
00:01:22.560,00:01:25.160,"keep that in mind because it'll come in handy later."
00:01:26.570,00:01:30.810,"So what was the ridiculous way we used to calculate Pi?"
00:01:30.810,00:01:33.600,"Well, it's the most obvious way."
00:01:33.600,00:01:38.600,"It's easy to show that Pi must be between three and four,"
00:01:38.670,00:01:41.610,"take a circle and draw a hexagon inside it,"
00:01:41.610,00:01:43.980,"with sides of length one."
00:01:43.980,00:01:46.210,"A regular hexagon can be divided"
00:01:46.210,00:01:49.190,"into six equal lateral triangles."
00:01:49.190,00:01:51.993,"So the diameter of the circle is two."
00:01:52.910,00:01:55.950,"Now the perimeter of the hexagon is six"
00:01:55.950,00:01:57.360,"and the circumference of the circle"
00:01:57.360,00:01:59.230,"must be larger than this,"
00:01:59.230,00:02:02.060,"so Pi must be greater than six over two."
00:02:02.060,00:02:04.930,"So Pi is greater than three."
00:02:04.930,00:02:08.280,"Now draw a square around the circle,"
00:02:08.280,00:02:10.530,"the perimeter of the square is eight"
00:02:10.530,00:02:13.090,"which is bigger than the circles circumference,"
00:02:13.090,00:02:16.140,"so Pi must be less than eight over two."
00:02:16.140,00:02:19.070,"So Pi is less than four."
00:02:19.070,00:02:21.830,"This was actually known for a thousands of years."
00:02:21.830,00:02:26.830,"And then in 250 BC, Archimedes improved on the method."
00:02:27.280,00:02:29.800,"- So first he starts with the hexagon, just like you did"
00:02:29.800,00:02:33.420,"and then he bisects the hexagon to dodecagon."
00:02:33.420,00:02:36.670,"So that's a 12 sided, regular 12 sided shape."
00:02:36.670,00:02:38.340,"And he calculates its perimeter,"
00:02:38.340,00:02:40.540,"the ratio of that perimeter to the diameter"
00:02:40.540,00:02:41.680,"will be less than Pi."
00:02:41.680,00:02:45.100,"He does the same thing for a circumscribed 12-gon"
00:02:45.100,00:02:48.720,"and finds an upper bound for Pi."
00:02:48.720,00:02:51.330,"The calculations now become a lot more tricky"
00:02:51.330,00:02:53.560,"because he has to extract square roots"
00:02:53.560,00:02:54.775,"and square roots of square roots"
00:02:54.775,00:02:57.200,"and turn all these into fractions,"
00:02:57.200,00:03:01.840,"but he works out the 12-gon, then the 24-gon, 48-gon"
00:03:01.840,00:03:03.750,"and by the time he gets to the 96-gon"
00:03:03.750,00:03:06.140,"he sort of had enough, but he gets,"
00:03:06.140,00:03:11.090,"in the end he gets Pi to between 3.1408 and 3.1429."
00:03:11.090,00:03:15.040,"So for over 2000 years ago, that's not too bad."
00:03:15.040,00:03:18.760,"- Yeah, that seems like all the precision you'd need in Pi."
00:03:18.760,00:03:21.220,"- Right, so this goes way beyond precision"
00:03:21.220,00:03:22.280,"for any practical purpose."
00:03:22.280,00:03:25.340,"This is now a matter of flexing your muscles."
00:03:25.340,00:03:29.100,"This is showing off just how much mathematical power"
00:03:29.100,00:03:32.330,"you have, that you can work out a constant like Pi"
00:03:32.330,00:03:33.920,"to very high precision."
00:03:33.920,00:03:36.960,"So for the next 2000 years, this is how everyone"
00:03:36.960,00:03:41.520,"carried on bisecting polygons to dizzying heights"
00:03:41.520,00:03:44.690,"as Pi passed through Chinese, Indian, Persian"
00:03:44.690,00:03:48.000,"and Arab mathematicians, each contributed to these bounds"
00:03:48.000,00:03:50.050,"along our committee's line."
00:03:50.050,00:03:53.660,"And in the late 16th century, Frenchman Francois Viete"
00:03:53.660,00:03:56.570,"doubled a dozen more times than Archimedes,"
00:03:56.570,00:03:59.937,"computing the perimeter of a polygon with 393,216 sides"
00:04:03.500,00:04:06.130,"only to be out done at the turn of the 17th century"
00:04:06.130,00:04:08.660,"by the Dutch Ludolph van Ceulen."
00:04:08.660,00:04:13.260,"He spent 25 years on the effort computing to high accuracy"
00:04:13.260,00:04:18.090,"the perimeter of a polygon with two to the 62 sides."
00:04:18.090,00:04:23.090,"That is four quintillion, 611 quadrillion, 686 trillion,"
00:04:24.000,00:04:27.833,"18 billion, 427 million, 387,904 sides."
00:04:30.710,00:04:33.900,"What was the reward for all of that hard work?"
00:04:33.900,00:04:38.300,"Just 35, correct decimal, places of Pi."
00:04:38.300,00:04:42.850,"He had these digits inscribed on his tombstone,"
00:04:42.850,00:04:45.240,"20 years later, his record was surpassed"
00:04:45.240,00:04:50.010,"by Christoph Grienberger who got 38, correct decimal places."
00:04:50.010,00:04:52.560,"- But he was the last to do it like this"
00:04:52.560,00:04:53.393,"- Pretty much."
00:04:53.393,00:04:56.800,"Yeah, because shortly thereafter we get Sir Isaac Newton"
00:04:56.800,00:04:57.760,"on the scene."
00:04:57.760,00:05:00.540,"And once Newton introduces his method"
00:05:00.540,00:05:04.140,"nobody is bisecting n-gons ever again."
00:05:04.140,00:05:09.090,"The year was 1666 and Newton was just 23 years old."
00:05:09.090,00:05:10.740,"He was quarantining at home"
00:05:10.740,00:05:13.910,"due to an outbreak of bubonic plague."
00:05:13.910,00:05:16.450,"Newton was playing around with simple expressions"
00:05:16.450,00:05:19.080,"like one plus X, all squared."
00:05:19.080,00:05:21.630,"You can multiply it out and get one plus two X"
00:05:21.630,00:05:23.200,"plus X squared."
00:05:23.200,00:05:25.690,"Or what about one plus X all cubed?"
00:05:25.690,00:05:27.760,"Well, again, you can multiply out all the terms"
00:05:27.760,00:05:32.450,"and get one plus three X plus three X squared plus X cubed."
00:05:32.450,00:05:35.190,"And you could do the same for one plus X to the four"
00:05:35.190,00:05:38.290,"or one plus X to the five and so on."
00:05:38.290,00:05:41.180,"But Newton knew there was a pattern that allowed him"
00:05:41.180,00:05:43.230,"to skip all the tedious arithmetic"
00:05:43.230,00:05:45.530,"and go straight to the answer."
00:05:45.530,00:05:47.670,"If you look at the numbers in these equations"
00:05:47.670,00:05:50.850,"the coefficients on X and X squared and so on,"
00:05:50.850,00:05:52.790,"well, they're actually just the numbers"
00:05:52.790,00:05:55.050,"in Pascal's triangle."
00:05:55.050,00:05:58.150,"The power that one plus X raised to"
00:05:58.150,00:06:02.025,"corresponds to the row of the triangle"
00:06:02.025,00:06:03.980,"And Pascal's triangle is really easy to make,"
00:06:03.980,00:06:05.070,"it's something that's been known"
00:06:05.070,00:06:07.820,"from ancient Greeks in Indians and Chinese Persians,"
00:06:07.820,00:06:09.960,"a lot of different cultures discovered this."
00:06:09.960,00:06:12.010,"All you do is whenever you have a row"
00:06:12.010,00:06:13.900,"you just add the two neighbors"
00:06:13.900,00:06:17.570,"and that gives you the value of the row below it."
00:06:17.570,00:06:21.290,"So that's a really quick easy thing you can compute"
00:06:21.290,00:06:24.200,"the coefficients for one plus X to the 10 in a second"
00:06:24.200,00:06:26.320,"instead of sitting there doing all the algebra."
00:06:26.320,00:06:28.820,"- The thing that fascinated me when I started looking"
00:06:28.820,00:06:32.120,"at those old documents was how even like,"
00:06:32.120,00:06:33.500,"I don't speak those languages,"
00:06:33.500,00:06:35.540,"I don't know those numbers systems"
00:06:35.540,00:06:37.310,"and yet it is obvious,"
00:06:37.310,00:06:40.090,"it is clear as day that they're all"
00:06:40.090,00:06:41.740,"writing down the same thing"
00:06:41.740,00:06:45.290,"which today in the Western world, we call Pascal's triangle."
00:06:45.290,00:06:46.400,"- That's the beauty of Mathematics."
00:06:46.400,00:06:48.600,"It transcends culture, it transcends time,"
00:06:48.600,00:06:50.060,"it transcends humanity."
00:06:50.060,00:06:52.300,"It's gonna be around well after we're gone"
00:06:52.300,00:06:54.970,"and ancient civilizations,"
00:06:54.970,00:06:57.800,"alien civilizations we'll know Pascal's triangle."
00:06:57.800,00:07:00.860,"Over time, people worked out a general formula"
00:07:00.860,00:07:03.290,"for the numbers in Pascal's triangle."
00:07:03.290,00:07:05.820,"So you can calculate the numbers in any row"
00:07:05.820,00:07:09.210,"without having to calculate all the rows before it,"
00:07:09.210,00:07:12.210,"for any expression one plus X to the N"
00:07:12.210,00:07:15.810,"it is equal to one plus N times X"
00:07:15.810,00:07:19.710,"plus N times N minus one X squared on two factorial"
00:07:19.710,00:07:23.630,"plus N times N minus one times and N minus two times X cubed"
00:07:23.630,00:07:26.360,"on three factorial and so on."
00:07:26.360,00:07:27.500,"And that's the binomial theorem."
00:07:27.500,00:07:29.890,"So binomial, because there's only two terms,"
00:07:29.890,00:07:34.390,"one in X by is two, there's two normals and a theorem"
00:07:34.390,00:07:37.210,"is that this is a theorem that you can rigorously prove"
00:07:37.210,00:07:40.160,"that this formula is exactly what you'll see"
00:07:40.160,00:07:43.050,"as the coefficients in Pascal's triangle."
00:07:43.050,00:07:46.610,"- [Alex] So all of this was known in Newton's day already."
00:07:46.610,00:07:48.450,"- Yeah, exactly, everybody knew this."
00:07:48.450,00:07:50.500,"Everybody saw this formula"
00:07:50.500,00:07:52.590,"and yet nobody thought to do with it"
00:07:52.590,00:07:54.340,"the thing that Newton did with it"
00:07:54.340,00:07:56.410,"which is to break the formula."
00:07:56.410,00:07:59.480,"The standard binomial theorem insist that you apply it"
00:07:59.480,00:08:02.490,"only when N is a positive integer,"
00:08:02.490,00:08:03.690,"which makes sense."
00:08:03.690,00:08:05.980,"This whole thing is about working out one plus X"
00:08:05.980,00:08:08.810,"times itself a certain number of times,"
00:08:08.810,00:08:13.390,"but Newton says, screw that just apply the theorem."
00:08:13.390,00:08:16.690,"Math is about finding patterns and then extending them"
00:08:16.690,00:08:19.310,"and trying to find out where they break."
00:08:19.310,00:08:22.300,"So he tries one plus X to the negative one."
00:08:22.300,00:08:24.630,"So that's one over one plus X."
00:08:24.630,00:08:28.600,"What happens if I just blindly plug in N equals negative one"
00:08:28.600,00:08:30.400,"for the right-hand side of the formula?"
00:08:30.400,00:08:34.280,"And what you get is the terms alternate back and forth."
00:08:34.280,00:08:39.100,"Plus one minus one, plus one minus one, and so on forever."
00:08:39.100,00:08:40.920,"So that's one minus X,"
00:08:40.920,00:08:42.850,"the next term will be a plus X squared,"
00:08:42.850,00:08:44.780,"the next one will be a minus X cubed"
00:08:44.780,00:08:46.650,"plus X to the fourth minus X to the fifth."
00:08:46.650,00:08:50.000,"So that just alternating series with plus and minus signs"
00:08:50.000,00:08:51.060,"as the coefficient."
00:08:51.060,00:08:53.900,"- [Derek] So it becomes an infinite series."
00:08:53.900,00:08:54.733,"- Yeah, that's right."
00:08:54.733,00:08:57.180,"If you, don't a positive integer the binomial theorem,"
00:08:57.180,00:08:59.510,"Newton's binomial theorem will give you an infinite sum."
00:08:59.510,00:09:00.560,"- But how do you understand that?"
00:09:00.560,00:09:02.160,"Like for all positive integers"
00:09:02.160,00:09:04.460,"it was just a finite set of terms"
00:09:04.460,00:09:06.860,"and now we've got an infinite set of terms."
00:09:06.860,00:09:09.500,"- Yeah, so what happens is if you have a positive integer"
00:09:09.500,00:09:10.470,"you remember that formula,"
00:09:10.470,00:09:12.303,"the coefficient looks like N times N minus one"
00:09:12.303,00:09:14.340,"times N minus two and so on,"
00:09:14.340,00:09:17.160,"when you get to N minus N, if N is a positive integer,"
00:09:17.160,00:09:18.530,"you will eventually get there"
00:09:18.530,00:09:19.980,"and N minus 10 is zero."
00:09:19.980,00:09:22.350,"So that coefficient and all the coefficients after it"
00:09:22.350,00:09:24.260,"are all zero and that's why it's just a finite sum,"
00:09:24.260,00:09:25.700,"it's a finite triangle."
00:09:25.700,00:09:27.500,"But once you get outside of the triangle"
00:09:27.500,00:09:30.500,"with positive integers, you never hit N minus N"
00:09:30.500,00:09:32.870,"because N is not a positive integer,"
00:09:32.870,00:09:34.640,"so you get this infinite series."
00:09:34.640,00:09:36.500,"- [Derek] So I think the big question is,"
00:09:36.500,00:09:38.430,"does this actually work?"
00:09:38.430,00:09:41.660,"Does Newton's infinite series actually give you the value"
00:09:41.660,00:09:43.530,"of one over one plus X?"
00:09:43.530,00:09:45.130,"- Right, and it might be nonsense."
00:09:45.130,00:09:47.340,"There's lots of math formulas that could break completely"
00:09:47.340,00:09:48.180,"when you do this."
00:09:48.180,00:09:50.470,"There's, we have rules for a reason"
00:09:50.470,00:09:54.140,"but we should always know the extent to which the rules"
00:09:54.140,00:09:56.520,"have a chance of working farther."
00:09:56.520,00:09:58.670,"If you take that whole series and you multiply it"
00:09:58.670,00:10:01.550,"by one plus X and you multiply all that out"
00:10:01.550,00:10:04.100,"you'll see all the terms cancel, except that leading one."
00:10:04.100,00:10:08.300,"And so that big series times one plus X is one."
00:10:08.300,00:10:11.190,"In other words, that big series is one over one plus X,"
00:10:11.190,00:10:13.240,"that's how Newton justified to himself"
00:10:13.240,00:10:15.831,"that it makes sense to apply the formula"
00:10:15.831,00:10:17.790,"where it shouldn't be applicable."
00:10:17.790,00:10:21.750,"So Newton is convinced the binomial theorem works"
00:10:21.750,00:10:24.890,"even for negative values of N,"
00:10:24.890,00:10:29.130,"which means there's more to Pascal's triangle"
00:10:29.130,00:10:33.750,"above the zeroeth you could add a zero and a one"
00:10:33.750,00:10:36.430,"that add to make that first one."
00:10:36.430,00:10:40.010,"And then that row would continue minus one, plus one,"
00:10:40.010,00:10:44.080,"minus one, plus one, all the way out to infinity."
00:10:44.080,00:10:46.240,"And outside the standard triangle"
00:10:46.240,00:10:49.510,"the implied value everywhere is zero."
00:10:49.510,00:10:50.750,"And this fits with that."
00:10:50.750,00:10:53.980,"The alternating plus and minus ones add to make zero"
00:10:53.980,00:10:57.050,"everywhere in the row beneath them."
00:10:57.050,00:11:01.720,"And you can extend the pattern for all negative integers"
00:11:01.720,00:11:03.780,"either using the binomial theorem"
00:11:03.780,00:11:06.540,"or just looking at what numbers would add together"
00:11:06.540,00:11:09.090,"to make the numbers underneath."
00:11:09.090,00:11:11.230,"And here's something amazing."
00:11:11.230,00:11:14.140,"If you ignore the negative signs for a minute"
00:11:14.140,00:11:16.630,"these are the exact same numbers arranged"
00:11:16.630,00:11:20.410,"in the same pattern as in the main triangle."
00:11:20.410,00:11:25.410,"The whole thing has just been rotated on its side."
00:11:28.350,00:11:31.470,"But Newton doesn't stop with the integers,"
00:11:31.470,00:11:36.470,"next he tries fractional powers like one plus X to the half."
00:11:36.850,00:11:37.840,"So now what does it mean,"
00:11:37.840,00:11:39.370,"you take one plus X to the one half."
00:11:39.370,00:11:42.030,"Well, that's the same thing as square root of one plus X."
00:11:42.030,00:11:43.260,"And he wants to understand"
00:11:43.260,00:11:45.430,"does that have the same expansion."
00:11:45.430,00:11:48.040,"Putting N equals a half into the binomial theorem"
00:11:48.040,00:11:50.810,"he gets an infinite series."
00:11:50.810,00:11:51.643,"- That makes me think"
00:11:51.643,00:11:54.530,"that we could actually go into Pascal's triangle"
00:11:54.530,00:11:56.820,"blow it up and add fractions"
00:11:56.820,00:11:59.960,"in between the rows that we're familiar with."
00:11:59.960,00:12:02.810,"- Exactly, there's even a continuum of Pascal's triangles,"
00:12:02.810,00:12:06.650,"between zero and one there's this a continuum of numbers"
00:12:06.650,00:12:08.280,"that you could put in for powers."
00:12:08.280,00:12:11.860,"- And you can think of each fraction like a half, a quarter,"
00:12:11.860,00:12:15.340,"a third as existing in its own plane"
00:12:15.340,00:12:17.530,"where in each plane pairs of numbers"
00:12:17.530,00:12:20.290,"add to make the number beneath them."
00:12:20.290,00:12:22.680,"And doesn't have to be a positive integer anymore."
00:12:22.680,00:12:23.990,"- It doesn't have to be a positive integer,"
00:12:23.990,00:12:25.120,"it doesn't have to be a negative integer"
00:12:25.120,00:12:25.980,"it doesn't have to be an integer."
00:12:25.980,00:12:27.717,"So now we're gonna take N to be a half"
00:12:27.717,00:12:28.930,"and he works this thing out"
00:12:28.930,00:12:30.170,"and then he could do all kinds of things."
00:12:30.170,00:12:33.110,"For example, he could work out the square root of three"
00:12:33.110,00:12:36.130,"very quickly and efficiently 'cause the square root of three"
00:12:36.130,00:12:38.470,"we can write three is four minus one."
00:12:38.470,00:12:41.000,"And if we pull out a four, then we get a squire root four"
00:12:41.000,00:12:44.120,"which is just two times the square root of"
00:12:44.120,00:12:45.730,"one minus a quarter."
00:12:45.730,00:12:48.430,"If you put in minus a quarter for X in this series,"
00:12:48.430,00:12:51.740,"you'll get a very rapidly converging series expansion"
00:12:51.740,00:12:54.690,"that will quickly give you square root of three"
00:12:54.690,00:12:56.090,"to high accuracy."
00:12:56.090,00:12:59.950,"Now, Newton is particularly interested in N equals a half"
00:12:59.950,00:13:02.240,"because the equation for a unit circle"
00:13:02.240,00:13:05.290,"is X squared plus Y squared equals one."
00:13:05.290,00:13:08.670,"And if you solve for Y, well the top part of the circle"
00:13:08.670,00:13:12.800,"is equal to one minus X squared to the half."
00:13:12.800,00:13:15.680,"This is basically the same expression he's been looking at,"
00:13:15.680,00:13:19.190,"he just has to replace X by minus X squared,"
00:13:19.190,00:13:22.110,"which adds in some minus signs and doubles the power of X"
00:13:22.110,00:13:23.520,"on each term."
00:13:23.520,00:13:25.400,"But now he's got an equation"
00:13:25.400,00:13:29.150,"for a circle where each term is just irrational number"
00:13:29.150,00:13:32.220,"times X raised to some power."
00:13:32.220,00:13:34.610,"Now we have two different ways of representing"
00:13:34.610,00:13:35.620,"the same thing."
00:13:35.620,00:13:37.300,"And whenever you have something like that"
00:13:37.300,00:13:38.460,"magic is about to happen,"
00:13:38.460,00:13:40.090,"fireworks is about to go off."
00:13:40.090,00:13:42.960,"- But how does he use this to calculate Pi?"
00:13:42.960,00:13:45.990,"- Well, luckily for us, he had just invented calculus"
00:13:45.990,00:13:48.110,"or what he called the theory of Fluxions."
00:13:48.110,00:13:51.560,"He realizes that if you integrate under that curve"
00:13:51.560,00:13:54.840,"as X goes from zero to one, you're getting the area"
00:13:54.840,00:13:57.080,"under the curve, which is a quarter circle."
00:13:57.080,00:14:00.250,"And he knows that the area of a unit circle"
00:14:00.250,00:14:02.230,"is exactly Pi R squared except R is one,"
00:14:02.230,00:14:03.550,"so the area is Pi."
00:14:03.550,00:14:04.810,"And we want just a quarter,"
00:14:04.810,00:14:06.283,"so the area is Pi over four."
00:14:07.545,00:14:10.220,"On the other side, he has this nice series"
00:14:10.220,00:14:13.810,"and he knows how to integrate X to some power."
00:14:13.810,00:14:16.790,"You just increase each power of X by one"
00:14:16.790,00:14:18.960,"and divide by the new power."
00:14:18.960,00:14:21.240,"And now you have an infinite series of terms"
00:14:21.240,00:14:24.950,"which just involve simple arithmetic with fractions."
00:14:24.950,00:14:26.830,"You put an X equals one"
00:14:26.830,00:14:31.620,"and you can calculate Pi to an arbitrarily high precision."
00:14:31.620,00:14:35.660,"But Newton goes even further adding one final tweak."
00:14:35.660,00:14:37.870,"A not good math paper has zero ideas,"
00:14:37.870,00:14:39.080,"it's just pushing through things"
00:14:39.080,00:14:41.530,"that everybody already knows but nobody bothered to do."
00:14:41.530,00:14:44.220,"Then there are good math papers that have one new idea"
00:14:44.220,00:14:45.330,"that's really shockingly."
00:14:45.330,00:14:48.640,"New Newton's on new idea number four at this point"
00:14:48.640,00:14:50.750,"and he's about to have new idea number five."
00:14:50.750,00:14:53.310,"And new number five is instead of integrating"
00:14:53.310,00:14:55.630,"from zero to one he's gonna integrate"
00:14:55.630,00:14:57.850,"just from zero to a half."
00:14:57.850,00:14:59.490,"When you have an infinite series"
00:14:59.490,00:15:03.980,"you want the terms to decrease in size, as fast as possible."
00:15:03.980,00:15:06.020,"That way you don't have to calculate as many of them"
00:15:06.020,00:15:08.080,"to get a pretty good answer."
00:15:08.080,00:15:11.530,"And Newton sees if he integrates not from zero to one,"
00:15:11.530,00:15:13.870,"but from zero to a half,"
00:15:13.870,00:15:16.710,"then when he subs in a half for X,"
00:15:16.710,00:15:20.810,"each term will shrink in size by an additional factor"
00:15:20.810,00:15:24.560,"of X squared, which in this case is a quarter."
00:15:24.560,00:15:27.240,"But if you only integrate to a half,"
00:15:27.240,00:15:30.730,"what is the area under the curve that you're computing?"
00:15:30.730,00:15:33.690,"Well, it is this part of a circle,"
00:15:33.690,00:15:37.530,"which you can break into a 30 degree sector of the circle,"
00:15:37.530,00:15:41.840,"which has an area of Pi on 12 plus a right triangle"
00:15:41.840,00:15:45.353,"with a base of a half and a height of root three on two."
00:15:46.300,00:15:50.113,"So that integral should come out to this expression."
00:15:51.090,00:15:54.540,"And rearranging for Pi, you get the following."
00:15:54.540,00:15:58.070,"Now, if you evaluate only the first five terms"
00:15:58.070,00:16:03.070,"you get Pi equals 3.14161, that's off by just two parts"
00:16:05.600,00:16:07.620,"in a 100,000."
00:16:07.620,00:16:10.300,"And to match the computational power of Van Ceulen"
00:16:10.300,00:16:12.990,"four quintillion sided polygon,"
00:16:12.990,00:16:16.980,"you would only need to compute 50 terms in Newton series."
00:16:16.980,00:16:21.230,"What, before it took years now would take only days."
00:16:21.230,00:16:26.230,"So no one was bisecting polygons to find Pi ever again."
00:16:26.530,00:16:28.870,"Why would you, yeah you do all that work"
00:16:28.870,00:16:31.030,"and somebody comes along and beats you in a second."
00:16:31.030,00:16:34.920,"It's sort of like a, once someone builds a crane"
00:16:34.920,00:16:37.010,"and then somebody else is still climbing up on a ladder"
00:16:37.010,00:16:38.070,"to put a brick on a house,"
00:16:38.070,00:16:41.130,"like that's just not how you build houses anymore,"
00:16:41.130,00:16:43.680,"we have new technology, are you out of your mind,"
00:16:43.680,00:16:45.020,"we're gonna build a 100 story house,"
00:16:45.020,00:16:46.640,"we're gonna build a five story thing"
00:16:46.640,00:16:47.770,"that's gonna fall over."
00:16:47.770,00:16:48.870,"You see it in New York city."
00:16:48.870,00:16:51.880,"You see, literally we're technology came along."
00:16:51.880,00:16:54.650,"There's rows and rows of five story buildings"
00:16:54.650,00:16:56.580,"and all of a sudden here's a 20 story"
00:16:56.580,00:16:58.930,"and here's the 30 story, and here's a 90 story."
00:16:59.840,00:17:01.993,"So it's all about who has the technology."
00:17:03.050,00:17:05.650,"For me, this is a story about how the obvious way"
00:17:05.650,00:17:09.190,"of doing things is not always the best way"
00:17:09.190,00:17:10.550,"and that it's often a good idea"
00:17:10.550,00:17:12.670,"to play around with patterns and push them"
00:17:12.670,00:17:15.980,"beyond the bounds where you expect them to work."
00:17:15.980,00:17:19.020,"Because a little bit of insight and mathematics"
00:17:19.020,00:17:21.667,"can go a very long way."
00:17:21.667,00:17:25.040,"(upbeat music)"
00:17:25.040,00:17:26.490,"- Hey, this video was sponsored"
00:17:26.490,00:17:29.340,"by Brilliant a website with interactive courses"
00:17:29.340,00:17:31.780,"and quizzes that let you dive deep into the topics"
00:17:31.780,00:17:33.980,"like the ones I've shown in this video,"
00:17:33.980,00:17:37.280,"calculus, neural networks, programming and python,"
00:17:37.280,00:17:38.710,"they've got you covered."
00:17:38.710,00:17:39.900,"Now, I sometimes get asked"
00:17:39.900,00:17:42.050,"why I don't get into the nitty-gritty detail"
00:17:42.050,00:17:44.780,"or solve numerical problems in my videos"
00:17:44.780,00:17:47.410,"and the answer is because I don't think a video"
00:17:47.410,00:17:49.250,"is the best way to learn those skills."
00:17:49.250,00:17:52.340,"The best way is to engage yourself in problem solving"
00:17:52.340,00:17:54.340,"like you can on Brilliant."

00:18:02.960,00:18:06.030,"I can say this is the only real way to learn,"
00:18:06.030,00:18:09.510,"you have to be a little uncomfortable to gain understanding."
00:18:09.510,00:18:12.030,"When I do these quizzes, I find that my brain"
