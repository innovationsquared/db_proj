00:00:00.130,00:00:02.350,"- This video was sponsored by KiwiCo."
00:00:02.350,00:00:04.553,"More about KiwiCo at the end of the show."
00:00:06.070,00:00:07.320,"I know what you're thinking."
00:00:07.320,00:00:08.153,"- Clickbait!"
00:00:08.153,00:00:11.750,"- No one has measured the speed of light, that's ridiculous."
00:00:11.750,00:00:18.000,"The speed of light is exactly 299,792,458 meters per second."
00:00:18.520,00:00:20.760,"We are so sure of it that since 1983,"
00:00:20.760,00:00:22.570,"we've actually used the speed of light"
00:00:22.570,00:00:24.660,"to define how long a meter is."
00:00:24.660,00:00:27.060,"It's just the distance light travels in a vacuum"
00:00:27.060,00:00:31.600,"in 1/299,792,458ths of a second."
00:00:31.600,00:00:34.760,"That definition ensures that the speed of light"
00:00:34.760,00:00:38.760,"is exactly this number, no decimals."
00:00:38.760,00:00:41.070,"But hear me out, in this video,"
00:00:41.070,00:00:42.150,"I will prove to you"
00:00:42.150,00:00:46.090,"that light may never actually travel at this speed"
00:00:46.090,00:00:50.280,"and I can say that because no one has actually measured it."
00:00:50.280,00:00:51.910,"We can't measure the speed of light"
00:00:51.910,00:00:54.583,"the same way we measure the speed of anything else."
00:01:02.590,00:01:03.830,"Destin: I think we're recording everywhere."
00:01:03.830,00:01:04.663,"What are we doing?"
00:01:04.663,00:01:07.078,"- This is a video about measuring the speed of stuff."
00:01:07.078,00:01:07.676,"Destin: OK"
00:01:07.676,00:01:11.570,"Tell me about how you measured the speed of the baseball"
00:01:11.570,00:01:13.460,"fired out of your cannon."
00:01:13.460,00:01:14.670,"- Well, to get the speed of the baseball,"
00:01:14.670,00:01:15.910,"you need to know two things."
00:01:15.910,00:01:18.380,"You need to know the distance between two points"
00:01:18.380,00:01:20.070,"and you need to know the time that it takes"
00:01:20.070,00:01:22.380,"the baseball to travel between those points."
00:01:22.380,00:01:24.950,"So basically we took distance divided by time,"
00:01:24.950,00:01:27.060,"and that's the speed of the baseball."
00:01:27.060,00:01:29.140,"And in our case, we were shooting with a high-speed camera,"
00:01:29.140,00:01:31.360,"so you basically just count the frames"
00:01:31.360,00:01:33.230,"and then your clock is internal."
00:01:33.230,00:01:34.470,"Oh, you're going relativity."
00:01:34.470,00:01:36.193,"You're gonna do something weird, aren't you?"
00:01:36.685,00:01:37.757,"- You saw it coming."
00:01:37.757,00:01:38.632,"I can't believe it."
00:01:38.632,00:01:39.610,"Destin: Oh man!"
00:01:39.610,00:01:43.143,"The thing I want to ask you about is the speed of light."
00:01:43.143,00:01:44.120,"Destin: OK"
00:01:44.120,00:01:46.470,"Could you measure the speed of light like this?"
00:01:47.710,00:01:50.710,"Imagine you have a laser that can fire a beam"
00:01:50.710,00:01:53.750,"through a perfect vacuum for one kilometer."
00:01:53.750,00:01:57.250,"Start a timer the instant you fire the laser beam"
00:01:57.250,00:02:00.940,"and then exactly when it hits the end, stop the clock."
00:02:00.940,00:02:04.330,"Except how do you know when light reaches one kilometer"
00:02:04.330,00:02:06.943,"if you and the clock are at the starting point?"
00:02:07.830,00:02:11.000,"Okay, so you need two clocks, one at the laser"
00:02:11.000,00:02:13.650,"and one at the end, which stops automatically"
00:02:13.650,00:02:15.810,"when it detects the laser light."
00:02:15.810,00:02:17.360,"But now, how do you make sure"
00:02:17.360,00:02:19.550,"your two clocks are synchronized?"
00:02:19.550,00:02:21.660,"Well, you could connect them via a wire"
00:02:21.660,00:02:24.410,"and send a pulse from one to the other,"
00:02:24.410,00:02:27.030,"but that pulse will travel at the speed of light,"
00:02:27.030,00:02:29.760,"so it will arrive with a time delay."
00:02:29.760,00:02:32.670,"You might think you can just subtract that time delay"
00:02:32.670,00:02:34.750,"but it is equal to the time it takes"
00:02:34.750,00:02:36.720,"for light to travel one kilometer."
00:02:36.720,00:02:39.623,"That's what we don't know and are trying to measure."
00:02:40.970,00:02:44.240,"Okay, new plan, start with the clocks together"
00:02:44.240,00:02:45.970,"and sync them up first"
00:02:45.970,00:02:49.000,"and then send one of the clocks down to the end."
00:02:49.000,00:02:52.090,"Now, what could possibly go wrong?"
00:02:52.090,00:02:53.170,"Well, I'll tell you."
00:02:53.170,00:02:54.940,"The clock at the finish line was moving"
00:02:54.940,00:02:56.530,"with respect to the one at the start"
00:02:56.530,00:02:59.820,"and special relativity tells us moving clocks ticks slow"
00:02:59.820,00:03:01.870,"relative to stationary observers."
00:03:01.870,00:03:04.830,"So by the time the clock reaches one kilometer,"
00:03:04.830,00:03:08.230,"it will no longer be in sync with the clock at the start."
00:03:08.230,00:03:11.550,"Can I tell you the only solution to this problem?"
00:03:11.550,00:03:13.230,"Ditch the second clock."
00:03:13.230,00:03:16.390,"Put a mirror at the end to reflect the light back"
00:03:16.390,00:03:18.330,"and use a single clock at the start"
00:03:18.330,00:03:21.170,"to time the full two kilometer round trip."
00:03:21.170,00:03:23.760,"- Wasn't this actually done before?"
00:03:23.760,00:03:25.680,"He was on a mountain and there's a wagon wheel"
00:03:25.680,00:03:28.800,"with a lantern and there's something like a mirror"
00:03:28.800,00:03:29.690,"on the other side of the mountain?"
00:03:29.690,00:03:31.200,"I've always wanted to do this."
00:03:31.200,00:03:34.040,"- So, that sounds a little"
00:03:34.040,00:03:35.160,"like how the speed of light"
00:03:35.160,00:03:36.870,"was first experimentally measured"
00:03:36.870,00:03:39.700,"by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1849."
00:03:39.700,00:03:42.110,"He shone a beam of light between the teeth"
00:03:42.110,00:03:44.670,"of a rapidly spinning gear to a mirror"
00:03:44.670,00:03:46.980,"up on a hill eight kilometers away."
00:03:46.980,00:03:49.030,"And then by increasing the speed of the gear,"
00:03:49.030,00:03:50.947,"he reached a point where the reflected light"
00:03:50.947,00:03:53.350,"passed through the next gap on the gear"
00:03:53.350,00:03:55.060,"and so it was observed."
00:03:55.060,00:03:56.300,"So he measured the speed of light"
00:03:56.300,00:03:59.950,"to be 313,000 kilometers per second,"
00:03:59.950,00:04:03.930,"which is within 5% of the presently accepted value."
00:04:03.930,00:04:06.308,"So someone has measured the speed of light?"
00:04:07.505,00:04:08.890,"or have they?"
00:04:08.890,00:04:11.260,"What has been measured is the round trip"
00:04:11.260,00:04:12.970,"or two-way speed of light,"
00:04:12.970,00:04:16.840,"but no one has measured the one-way speed of light."
00:04:16.840,00:04:18.680,"One thing I'm gonna throw at you."
00:04:18.680,00:04:21.370,"And I'm just gonna come out and tell you."
00:04:21.370,00:04:26.150,"It's like what if the speed of light in this direction"
00:04:26.150,00:04:29.530,"is different from the speed of light in this direction?"
00:04:29.530,00:04:31.768,"- Then that sounds like a Veritasium video."
00:04:31.768,00:04:34.020,"(both laughing)"
00:04:34.020,00:04:35.930,"- The question is could you figure it out?"
00:04:35.930,00:04:37.500,"The kind of crux of this problem"
00:04:37.500,00:04:39.280,"is that the only way people have managed"
00:04:39.280,00:04:42.890,"to measure the speed of light is for a round trip."
00:04:42.890,00:04:44.090,"No one's ever managed"
00:04:44.090,00:04:46.630,"to measure the speed of light in just one direction."
00:04:46.630,00:04:48.670,"It's possible that the speed of light"
00:04:48.670,00:04:51.680,"is half of 'c' in one direction,"
00:04:51.680,00:04:53.660,"and then instantaneous on the return journey."
00:04:53.660,00:04:54.460,"Destin: What?!"
00:04:54.460,00:04:55.650,"That's possible."
00:04:55.650,00:04:57.570,"Destin: Are you serious?"
00:04:57.570,00:04:59.560,"- Think about communicating with an astronaut"
00:04:59.560,00:05:01.040,"stranded on Mars."
00:05:01.040,00:05:02.441,"Let's call him..."
00:05:02.441,00:05:03.471,"Mark."
00:05:03.471,00:05:07.797,"We send out a signal and get a response 20 minutes later."
00:05:07.797,00:05:11.579,"So we imagine our signal takes 10 minutes to get there"
00:05:11.579,00:05:14.660,"and the reply takes 10 minutes to come back,"
00:05:14.660,00:05:19.406,"but it's possible that our message took all 20 minutes to get there "
00:05:19.406,00:05:22.323,"and the reply came back instantaneously."
00:05:23.440,00:05:25.600,"There's no way we could tell the difference"
00:05:25.600,00:05:27.930,"between these two scenarios."
00:05:27.930,00:05:31.070,"But why would the speed of light be different?"
00:05:31.070,00:05:32.590,"Well, it's possible that there"
00:05:32.590,00:05:35.950,"is some preferred direction through spacetime."
00:05:35.950,00:05:38.400,"I mean, our universe has a lot of symmetries,"
00:05:38.400,00:05:40.600,"but there is also some asymmetry."
00:05:40.600,00:05:43.400,"For example, why is there so much matter"
00:05:43.400,00:05:45.448,"relative to anti-matter?"
00:05:45.448,00:05:47.100,"And physicists have worked out"
00:05:47.100,00:05:49.130,"internally consistent theories of physics"
00:05:49.130,00:05:51.060,"in which the speed of light is different"
00:05:51.060,00:05:53.320,"forwards and in reverse."
00:05:53.320,00:05:56.012,"The speed of light could vary by just a few percent"
00:05:56.012,00:05:59.870,"up to at the extreme, going 'c' over two in one direction"
00:05:59.870,00:06:02.313,"and infinitely fast in the other direction."
00:06:03.520,00:06:05.541,"Destin: Okay, so let me figure this out."
00:06:06.057,00:06:06.964,"So yeah,"
00:06:07.899,00:06:09.460,"I kind of don't believe you."
00:06:09.658,00:06:10.931,"I kinda don't believe you."
00:06:11.047,00:06:13.670,"I don't believe you that light is a different speed"
00:06:13.670,00:06:15.040,"in one direction, but in the other,"
00:06:15.040,00:06:19.180,"but I know you well enough to know that you wouldn't call me"
00:06:19.180,00:06:22.770,"and put a camera on me unless you knew you were right"
00:06:22.770,00:06:24.620,"and that's what scares me about this conversation."
00:06:25.198,00:06:26.031,"That scares me."
00:06:28.550,00:06:31.240,"- Now, you might think it is just simpler"
00:06:31.240,00:06:33.160,"that light should travel at the same speed"
00:06:33.160,00:06:34.460,"in all directions,"
00:06:34.460,00:06:37.500,"but the truth is: that is a convention"
00:06:37.500,00:06:40.303,"rather than an experimentally verified fact."
00:06:42.550,00:06:46.660,"Einstein himself pointed this out in his famous 1905 paper,"
00:06:46.660,00:06:48.960,"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies."
00:06:48.960,00:06:51.670,"He spends the first couple of pages on the problem"
00:06:51.670,00:06:55.530,"of synchronizing clocks at different locations A and B."
00:06:55.530,00:06:57.370,"And he says there is no way"
00:06:57.370,00:07:00.470,"that we can meaningfully compare the times they measure"
00:07:00.470,00:07:03.090,"unless we established by definition"
00:07:03.090,00:07:06.120,"that the time required by light to travel from A to B"
00:07:06.120,00:07:09.413,"equals the time it requires to travel from B to A."
00:07:10.450,00:07:12.730,"He's essentially defining that the speed of light"
00:07:12.730,00:07:15.450,"in opposite directions is the same."
00:07:15.450,00:07:18.950,"And he puts by definition in italics to remind us"
00:07:18.950,00:07:20.780,"that this is only a convention."
00:07:20.780,00:07:24.160,"It's known as the Einstein synchronization convention."
00:07:24.160,00:07:25.330,"So the idea"
00:07:25.330,00:07:28.130,"that the speed of light is the same in opposite directions"
00:07:28.130,00:07:29.720,"as Einstein would later write"
00:07:29.720,00:07:32.550,"is neither a supposition nor a hypothesis"
00:07:32.550,00:07:34.720,"about the physical nature of light,"
00:07:34.720,00:07:37.380,"but a stipulation that I can make"
00:07:37.380,00:07:39.650,"of my own free will to arrive"
00:07:39.650,00:07:42.340,"at a definition of simultaneity."
00:07:42.340,00:07:44.410,"That sounds a lot more subjective"
00:07:44.410,00:07:46.580,"than how I think most people would imagine"
00:07:46.580,00:07:48.600,"the speed of light is defined."
00:07:48.600,00:07:51.333,"Destin: Dude, this is hardcore."
00:07:51.333,00:07:53.160,"(laughs)"
00:07:53.160,00:07:54.360,"I've never thought about this."
00:07:54.360,00:07:56.120,"- I didn't think about this before either."
00:07:56.120,00:07:57.880,"I always assumed that when we said"
00:07:57.880,00:07:58.760,"the speed of light is c,"
00:07:58.760,00:08:00.680,"we meant the one way speed of light."
00:08:00.680,00:08:02.970,"There's no way to define the one-way speed of light,"
00:08:02.970,00:08:04.400,"so the only thing we can really define"
00:08:04.400,00:08:05.600,"is the two way speed of light."
00:08:05.600,00:08:08.580,"Just look at the way Einstein defined c."
00:08:08.580,00:08:12.200,"It's for the round trip from A to B and back."
00:08:12.200,00:08:13.810,"I don't know if you saw on your physics classes,"
00:08:13.810,00:08:15.820,"but whenever there was a light clock"
00:08:15.820,00:08:18.790,"it would always bounce the light up and then back."
00:08:18.790,00:08:22.150,"You would never see a light clock just bounce light one way."
00:08:22.150,00:08:25.120,"And this is why the only thing we can be certain"
00:08:25.120,00:08:27.740,"is constant for all inertial observers"
00:08:27.740,00:08:30.010,"is the two-way speed of light."
00:08:30.010,00:08:31.720,"For over 100 years,"
00:08:31.720,00:08:34.500,"scientists have tried to find a way around this"
00:08:34.500,00:08:37.720,"to measure the one way speed of light by itself."
00:08:37.720,00:08:38.960,"Here is a paper published"
00:08:38.960,00:08:41.180,"in the American Journal of Physics in 2009"
00:08:41.180,00:08:44.220,"that claims to measure the one-way speed of light."
00:08:44.220,00:08:46.970,"And here is the paper debunking this study,"
00:08:46.970,00:08:48.220,"pointing out that these authors"
00:08:48.220,00:08:51.400,"were actually measuring the two way speed of light."
00:08:51.400,00:08:53.990,"But I'm imagining you might have some ideas"
00:08:53.990,00:08:55.700,"for how to measure the one way speed of light,"
00:08:55.700,00:08:57.710,"so let's go through some of them."
00:08:57.710,00:09:00.090,"I mean, can't we just use a high-speed camera"
00:09:00.090,00:09:02.040,"that shoots at a trillion frames a second"
00:09:02.040,00:09:05.830,"so we can actually see light passing through an object?"
00:09:05.830,00:09:07.750,"The problem is you're not only seeing"
00:09:07.750,00:09:09.020,"the light pass through the object,"
00:09:09.020,00:09:11.230,"you're also seeing it bounce back to the camera,"
00:09:11.230,00:09:13.883,"measuring the two way speed, not one way."
00:09:14.900,00:09:16.240,"Destin: Here you go."
00:09:16.240,00:09:19.130,"Get a spool of fiber optic cable."
00:09:19.130,00:09:22.400,"I don't know, like 186,000 miles."
00:09:22.400,00:09:23.860,"And you could shine the light here"
00:09:23.860,00:09:25.730,"and you have the other end of the fiber here"
00:09:25.730,00:09:28.860,"and you could shine here and then wait and see the delay,"
00:09:28.860,00:09:30.690,"see if it's one second later over here."
00:09:30.690,00:09:32.020,"- The thing is like that fiber"
00:09:32.020,00:09:33.410,"is going around and around and around,"
00:09:33.410,00:09:36.110,"so it could be that when the light goes this way"
00:09:36.110,00:09:39.010,"over the top of the loop, it goes slower"
00:09:39.010,00:09:41.670,"and then when it goes on the bottom, it goes faster."
00:09:41.670,00:09:43.570,"It all averages out in the fiber."
00:09:43.570,00:09:45.610,"And you're essentially getting lots of round trips"
00:09:45.610,00:09:48.160,"in that fiber, so you're never getting a one-way."
00:09:48.160,00:09:50.580,"What if you center a synchronizing device"
00:09:50.580,00:09:54.920,"between your two clocks and send out simultaneous pulses?"
00:09:54.920,00:09:57.840,"Well, if the speed of light is the same in both directions,"
00:09:57.840,00:10:00.450,"this perfectly synchronizes your clocks."
00:10:00.450,00:10:03.440,"But if the speed of light is different in each direction,"
00:10:03.440,00:10:05.840,"one of the clocks will be ahead of the other."
00:10:05.840,00:10:08.450,"And it will be ahead by just the right amount"
00:10:08.450,00:10:10.510,"so that when you measure the speed of light,"
00:10:10.510,00:10:12.870,"you'll find the value to be C"
00:10:12.870,00:10:16.700,"even though that was not the speed the light was traveling."
00:10:16.700,00:10:20.650,"This is the same reason GPS synchronized clocks won't work."
00:10:20.650,00:10:23.220,"The whole GPS system is based on the assumption"
00:10:23.220,00:10:26.190,"that the speed of light is the same in all directions."
00:10:26.190,00:10:28.900,"If the speed of light is different in different directions,"
00:10:28.900,00:10:30.820,"the light pulses from satellites"
00:10:30.820,00:10:32.830,"will travel at different speeds"
00:10:32.830,00:10:35.020,"so the clocks won't be properly synced."
00:10:35.020,00:10:37.300,"By that, I mean they will always measure c"
00:10:37.300,00:10:40.623,"for the one way speed of light whether it is or isn't."
00:10:42.770,00:10:45.790,"How about starting with synchronized clocks in the middle"
00:10:45.790,00:10:49.450,"and moving them apart with equal and opposite speeds?"
00:10:49.450,00:10:52.140,"That way, the time dilation for each clock will be the same"
00:10:52.140,00:10:53.780,"and they'll still be synchronized"
00:10:53.780,00:10:56.030,"when they reached the end points."
00:10:56.030,00:10:58.370,"But again, this only works"
00:10:58.370,00:11:01.010,"if the speed of light in each direction is the same."
00:11:01.010,00:11:03.340,"If the speed of light depends on direction,"
00:11:03.340,00:11:05.670,"then so does time dilation."
00:11:05.670,00:11:07.670,"You might think you could move the clocks"
00:11:07.670,00:11:11.740,"really, really slowly so that time dilation is negligible."
00:11:11.740,00:11:13.690,"But if the speed of light is different"
00:11:13.690,00:11:15.030,"in different directions,"
00:11:15.030,00:11:17.410,"you can't just use the standard formula"
00:11:17.410,00:11:19.850,"to calculate what that time dilation would be."
00:11:19.850,00:11:22.590,"I mean, it could be a lot worse than you think."
00:11:22.590,00:11:25.100,"So, the reality is we're stuck."
00:11:25.100,00:11:26.540,"We need synchronized clocks"
00:11:26.540,00:11:28.210,"to measure the one-way speed of light,"
00:11:28.210,00:11:30.200,"but we need to know the one-way speed of light"
00:11:30.200,00:11:32.680,"in order to synchronize our clocks."
00:11:32.680,00:11:35.520,"Now, this might sound like just an academic concern,"
00:11:35.520,00:11:37.030,"so I want to go through an example"
00:11:37.030,00:11:39.640,"to illustrate just how differently the universe works"
00:11:39.640,00:11:42.743,"if the speed of light is not the same in all directions."
00:11:43.680,00:11:45.330,"Let's say on Mars,"
00:11:45.330,00:11:48.980,"Mark is trying to synchronize his clock with the Earth."
00:11:48.980,00:11:51.220,"At noon, mission control sends out a message"
00:11:51.220,00:11:54.760,"that says this signal was sent at exactly 12 o'clock."
00:11:54.760,00:11:56.490,"When Mark receives this message,"
00:11:56.490,00:11:59.240,"he uses the Einstein synchronization convention"
00:11:59.240,00:12:00.840,"to set his clock."
00:12:00.840,00:12:03.180,"He knows the roundtrip time delay is 20 minutes,"
00:12:03.180,00:12:05.650,"so he assumes the signal must have taken 10 minutes"
00:12:05.650,00:12:07.220,"to reach him."
00:12:07.220,00:12:09.550,"He programs his clock to 12:10 PM"
00:12:09.550,00:12:11.440,"and sends a return message."
00:12:11.440,00:12:13.333,"This reply sent at 12:10."
00:12:15.070,00:12:17.460,"The message is received on Earth at 12:20 PM,"
00:12:17.460,00:12:20.430,"so both parties know the synchronization was successful."
00:12:20.430,00:12:22.510,"When the clock reads 12:20 on Earth,"
00:12:22.510,00:12:25.913,"it simultaneously reads 12:20 on Mars."
00:12:27.210,00:12:29.300,"But now consider what happens if the speed of light"
00:12:29.300,00:12:31.403,"is not the same in both directions."
00:12:32.560,00:12:35.700,"Let's say it is 'c' over two from Earth to Mars,"
00:12:35.700,00:12:38.940,"and then instantaneous from Mars back to Earth."
00:12:38.940,00:12:40.290,"No one knows this, of course,"
00:12:40.290,00:12:43.080,"so they continue to use the Einstein convention."
00:12:43.080,00:12:45.140,"The message is sent from Earth,"
00:12:45.140,00:12:48.620,"but now it takes a full 20 minutes to reach Mars."
00:12:48.620,00:12:50.520,"But Mark doesn't know this."
00:12:50.520,00:12:52.220,"And as before he assumes the signal"
00:12:52.220,00:12:53.340,"took 10 minutes to reach him,"
00:12:53.340,00:12:55.890,"so he sets his clock to 12:10 PM"
00:12:55.890,00:12:58.800,"even though on Earth, it is now 12:20."
00:12:58.800,00:13:02.170,"Mark then sends this reply sent at 12:10 PM,"
00:13:02.170,00:13:05.080,"which is instantaneously received on Earth"
00:13:05.080,00:13:07.263,"at 12:20 Earth time."
00:13:08.560,00:13:11.910,"The experience for the two communicators is the same."
00:13:11.910,00:13:13.690,"The same messages were received"
00:13:13.690,00:13:15.830,"with the same local time delays,"
00:13:15.830,00:13:19.220,"but their clocks are out of sync by 10 minutes."
00:13:19.220,00:13:21.030,"What they think is the same moment"
00:13:21.030,00:13:24.340,"for the other observer actually isn't"
00:13:24.340,00:13:26.520,"and there is no way they can ever recognize"
00:13:26.520,00:13:28.210,"or correct this error."
00:13:28.210,00:13:30.790,"Imagine if someone on Earth immediately responded"
00:13:30.790,00:13:32.830,"how long did this message take to reach you?"
00:13:32.830,00:13:34.710,"It's now 12:20."
00:13:34.710,00:13:37.510,"Well, the message would take 20 minutes to reach Mars,"
00:13:37.510,00:13:39.580,"but due to the clocks being out of sync,"
00:13:39.580,00:13:41.940,"it would arrive at 12:30 Mars time,"
00:13:41.940,00:13:44.180,"so Mark would reply 10 minutes,"
00:13:44.180,00:13:47.080,"a message that would instantaneously reach the Earth"
00:13:47.080,00:13:49.203,"at 12:40 Earth time."
00:13:50.220,00:13:54.210,"The space-time diagram shows how there is flexibility"
00:13:54.210,00:13:56.550,"in what you consider to be the same moment"
00:13:56.550,00:13:58.350,"at two different locations"
00:13:58.350,00:14:01.950,"and in how you define the one-way speed of light."
00:14:01.950,00:14:03.340,"Einstein chose the convention"
00:14:03.340,00:14:05.840,"where the one-way speed of light is always the same,"
00:14:05.840,00:14:08.290,"but from an experimental perspective,"
00:14:08.290,00:14:11.200,"any other convention is just as valid,"
00:14:11.200,00:14:13.650,"up to and including one where the speed of light"
00:14:13.650,00:14:17.543,"is C over two one way and instantaneous the other way."
00:14:18.680,00:14:21.240,"And in that case, it's interesting to think about"
00:14:21.240,00:14:24.640,"what each observer is seeing when they look at the other."
00:14:24.640,00:14:28.760,"Mark would be seeing the Earth as it was 20 minutes ago,"
00:14:28.760,00:14:32.380,"but Earth is seeing Mars in real time"
00:14:32.380,00:14:35.233,"exactly as it is right now."
00:14:36.160,00:14:39.300,"And this effect wouldn't stop at Mars, look beyond it"
00:14:39.300,00:14:42.400,"and you could see stars hundreds of light years away,"
00:14:42.400,00:14:44.700,"not as they looked centuries ago,"
00:14:44.700,00:14:49.310,"but exactly as they are right this instant."
00:14:49.310,00:14:53.130,"One of the things is you only know about that light"
00:14:53.130,00:14:55.610,"when it reaches you and you don't know anything about"
00:14:55.610,00:14:57.140,"what journey it took to get to you."
00:14:57.140,00:15:01.110,"You just see it and it's there, so like it's instantaneous."
00:15:01.110,00:15:03.240,"So an instantaneous interpretation of that light"
00:15:03.240,00:15:06.083,"is just as good as one where it takes 'c' to reach us."
00:15:07.160,00:15:08.990,"- This is breaking my brain."
00:15:08.990,00:15:11.600,"Yeah, I mean, it's kind of unknowable, isn't it?"
00:15:11.600,00:15:12.640,"- It is unknowable."
00:15:12.640,00:15:14.550,"That's the whole point of the video."
00:15:14.550,00:15:16.430,"Is to say, we've all agreed"
00:15:16.430,00:15:18.680,"and this is based on something Einstein wrote in 1905."
00:15:18.680,00:15:22.150,"We've all agreed to just say it's 'c' in every direction,"
00:15:22.150,00:15:24.710,"but the truth is the physics works the same"
00:15:24.710,00:15:28.270,"whether it's 'c' or 'c' over two and instantaneous"
00:15:28.270,00:15:29.630,"or anything in between."
00:15:29.630,00:15:31.870,"As long as the roundtrip works out to be 'c',"
00:15:31.870,00:15:33.697,"none of physics breaks"
00:15:33.697,00:15:35.102,"and that's the crazy thing."
00:15:35.310,00:15:38.060,"- So if we can never measure the one-way speed of light,"
00:15:38.060,00:15:40.150,"and if it makes no difference"
00:15:40.150,00:15:42.630,"to any of the laws of physics,"
00:15:42.630,00:15:45.750,"then what's the point in even talking about it?"
00:15:45.750,00:15:48.240,"Well, that is certainly one valid perspective"
00:15:48.240,00:15:51.950,"in a debate that has been ongoing since 1905."
00:15:51.950,00:15:54.350,"Some physicists appeal to Occam's razor."
00:15:54.350,00:15:57.210,"Isn't it just simpler if light travels at the same speed"
00:15:57.210,00:15:58.370,"in all directions?"
00:15:58.370,00:15:59.850,"Most working physicists"
00:15:59.850,00:16:03.330,"just accept the convention and move on with their lives,"
00:16:03.330,00:16:04.850,"but I think it's important to point out"
00:16:04.850,00:16:06.780,"that it is just a convention,"
00:16:06.780,00:16:09.103,"not an empirically verified fact."
00:16:13.670,00:16:15.750,"Personally, I find it fascinating"
00:16:15.750,00:16:17.990,"that this is something about the universe"
00:16:17.990,00:16:19.670,"that is hidden from us."
00:16:19.670,00:16:22.380,"Sure, the round trip speed of light is 'c',"
00:16:22.380,00:16:26.420,"but does the one way speed even have a well-defined value?"
00:16:26.420,00:16:27.620,"And if it doesn't,"
00:16:27.620,00:16:30.770,"what does that mean for the concept of simultaneity?"
00:16:30.770,00:16:33.950,"When is right now on Mars?"
00:16:33.950,00:16:35.440,"Does it even make sense to talk"
00:16:35.440,00:16:37.220,"about things happening at the same time"
00:16:37.220,00:16:39.173,"if they're separated by distance?"
00:16:39.804,00:16:42.860,"Y'know maybe this is an odd quirk of the universe"
00:16:42.860,00:16:45.440,"and there's no good reason for it"
00:16:45.440,00:16:50.060,"or maybe, when physics takes the next paradigmatic leap,"
00:16:50.060,00:16:53.260,"our inability to measure the one way speed of light"
00:16:53.260,00:16:57.630,"will be the obvious clue to the way General Relativity,"
00:16:57.630,00:17:02.030,"Quantum Mechanics, space and time are all connected."
00:17:02.030,00:17:04.933,"And we'll wonder why we didn't see it before."
00:17:10.690,00:17:13.160,"Hey, this video was sponsored by KiwiCo."
00:17:13.160,00:17:16.860,"They create awesome projects and toys to get kids making."
00:17:16.860,00:17:18.430,"I use their crates with my son"
00:17:18.430,00:17:21.620,"and they are a lot of fun while also being educational."
00:17:21.620,00:17:22.800,"Now, for viewers of this video,"
00:17:22.800,00:17:25.970,"they are offering 50% off your first month of any crate,"

00:17:31.950,00:17:33.960,"Now, I think this is a fantastic offer"
00:17:33.960,00:17:36.480,"because these crates are a great resource"
00:17:36.480,00:17:38.760,"for learning at home, which is something"
00:17:38.760,00:17:42.130,"anyone with kids is doing a lot of at the moment."
00:17:42.130,00:17:45.170,"Plus all the supplies you need come right in the box,"
00:17:45.170,00:17:47.610,"which means you don't need to run to the store,"
00:17:47.610,00:17:49.910,"which is again ideal."
00:17:49.910,00:17:51.110,"Now my kids are still young,"
