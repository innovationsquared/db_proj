00:00:00.000,00:00:03.600,"- Do you bring this trick out at parties?"
00:00:03.600,00:00:05.460,"- Oh no. It's a terrible party trick."
00:00:05.460,00:00:06.900,"Here we go."
00:00:06.900,00:00:10.020,"3.141592653589793"
00:00:10.020,00:00:11.640,"- This is Grant Gussman."
00:00:11.640,00:00:13.080,"He watched an old video of mine"
00:00:13.080,00:00:13.913,"about how we think"
00:00:13.913,00:00:16.110,"that there are two systems of thought."
00:00:16.110,00:00:19.650,"System two is the conscious slow effortful system."
00:00:19.650,00:00:21.660,"And system one is subconscious."
00:00:21.660,00:00:23.820,"Fast and automatic."
00:00:23.820,00:00:26.460,"To explore how these systems work in his own head,"
00:00:26.460,00:00:29.760,"Grant decided to memorize a hundred digits of pi."
00:00:29.760,00:00:30.593,"- Three eight four four six..."
00:00:30.593,00:00:33.000,"- Then he just kept going."
00:00:33.000,00:00:36.480,"He has now memorized 23,000 digits of pi"
00:00:36.480,00:00:38.947,"in preparation to challenge the north American record"
00:00:38.947,00:00:40.753,"- .95493038196."
00:00:40.753,00:00:41.586,"That's 200."
00:00:41.586,00:00:44.169,"(Derek laughs)"
00:00:45.060,00:00:46.083,"- That's amazing."
00:00:47.970,00:00:51.663,"I have wanted to make a video about experts for a long time."
00:00:56.790,00:00:58.470,"This is Magnus Carlsen,"
00:00:58.470,00:01:00.570,"the five time world chess champion."
00:01:00.570,00:01:02.070,"He's being shown chessboards"
00:01:02.070,00:01:05.460,"and asked to identify the game in which they occurred."
00:01:05.460,00:01:10.323,"- This looks an awful lot like Tal V Botvinnik."
00:01:10.323,00:01:13.584,"(playful music)"
00:01:13.584,00:01:14.417,"- Whoops."
00:01:16.075,00:01:18.524,"- Okay. This is the 24th game from Sevilla obviously."
00:01:18.524,00:01:19.380,"(chuckling)"
00:01:19.380,00:01:22.140,"- Now I'm going to play through an opening."
00:01:22.140,00:01:25.050,"And stop me when you recognize the game."
00:01:25.050,00:01:28.444,"And if you can tell me who was playing black in this one."
00:01:28.444,00:01:29.277,"Okay."
00:01:29.277,00:01:32.550,"(playful music)"
00:01:32.550,00:01:34.555,"I'm sure you've seen this opening before."
00:01:34.555,00:01:35.941,"- Okay. It's gonna be Anand."
00:01:35.941,00:01:37.697,"(laughs)"
00:01:37.697,00:01:39.047,"- Against?"
00:01:39.047,00:01:40.500,"- Zapata."
00:01:40.500,00:01:42.000,"- How can he do this?"
00:01:42.000,00:01:44.700,"It seems like superhuman ability."
00:01:44.700,00:01:45.540,"Well decades ago,"
00:01:45.540,00:01:46.740,"scientists wanted to know"
00:01:46.740,00:01:49.152,"what makes experts like chess masters special."
00:01:49.152,00:01:51.960,"Do they have incredibly high IQ's,"
00:01:51.960,00:01:54.300,"much better spatial reasoning than average,"
00:01:54.300,00:01:56.520,"bigger short term memory spans?"
00:01:56.520,00:01:58.560,"Well, it turns out that as a group,"
00:01:58.560,00:02:02.640,"chess masters are not exceptional on any of these measures."
00:02:02.640,00:02:04.380,"But one experiment showed"
00:02:04.380,00:02:08.100,"how their performance was vastly superior to amateurs."
00:02:08.100,00:02:10.980,"In 1973, William Chase and Herbert Simon"
00:02:10.980,00:02:12.900,"recruited three chess players,"
00:02:12.900,00:02:14.610,"a master, an A player,"
00:02:14.610,00:02:18.030,"who's an advanced amateur, and a beginner."
00:02:18.030,00:02:20.430,"A chess board was set up with around 25 pieces"
00:02:20.430,00:02:22.740,"positioned as they might be during a game."
00:02:22.740,00:02:24.000,"And each player was allowed"
00:02:24.000,00:02:26.460,"to look at the board for five seconds."
00:02:26.460,00:02:27.390,"Then they were asked"
00:02:27.390,00:02:29.100,"to replicate the setup from memory"
00:02:29.100,00:02:31.260,"on a second board in front of them."
00:02:31.260,00:02:32.550,"The players could take as many"
00:02:32.550,00:02:34.140,"five second peeks as they needed"
00:02:34.140,00:02:36.150,"to get their board to match."
00:02:36.150,00:02:38.130,"From just the first look,"
00:02:38.130,00:02:41.370,"the master could recall the positions of 16 pieces."
00:02:41.370,00:02:43.017,"The A player could recall eight,"
00:02:43.017,00:02:45.119,"and the beginner only four."
00:02:45.119,00:02:48.000,"The master only needed half the number of peeks"
00:02:48.000,00:02:50.730,"as the A player to get their board perfect."
00:02:50.730,00:02:52.620,"But then the researchers arranged the board"
00:02:52.620,00:02:54.600,"with pieces in random positions"
00:02:54.600,00:02:57.240,"that would never arise in a real game."
00:02:57.240,00:02:59.325,"And now, the chess master performed"
00:02:59.325,00:03:01.590,"no better than the beginner."
00:03:01.590,00:03:02.520,"After the first look,"
00:03:02.520,00:03:04.020,"all players, regardless of rank"
00:03:04.020,00:03:06.810,"could remember the location of only three pieces."
00:03:06.810,00:03:08.220,"The data are clear."
00:03:08.220,00:03:10.980,"Chess experts don't have better memory in general,"
00:03:10.980,00:03:12.870,"but they have better memory specifically"
00:03:12.870,00:03:15.960,"for chess positions that could occur in a real game."
00:03:15.960,00:03:18.720,"The implication is what makes the chess master special,"
00:03:18.720,00:03:22.110,"is that they have seen lots and lots of chess games."
00:03:22.110,00:03:22.943,"And over that time,"
00:03:22.943,00:03:24.570,"their brains have learned patterns."
00:03:24.570,00:03:25.650,"So rather than seeing"
00:03:25.650,00:03:28.170,"individual pieces at individual positions,"
00:03:28.170,00:03:32.160,"they see a smaller number of recognizable configurations."
00:03:32.160,00:03:33.960,"This is called 'chunking'."
00:03:33.960,00:03:36.000,"What we have stored in long-term memory"
00:03:36.000,00:03:40.050,"allows us to recognize complex stimuli as just one thing."
00:03:40.050,00:03:42.660,"For example, you recognize this as pi"
00:03:42.660,00:03:45.000,"rather than a string of six unrelated numbers"
00:03:45.000,00:03:47.790,"or meaningless squiggles for that matter."
00:03:47.790,00:03:49.980,"- There's a wonderful sequence I like a lot"
00:03:49.980,00:03:52.830,"which is three zero one seven three."
00:03:52.830,00:03:57.720,"Which to me, means Stephen Curry number 30, won 73 games,"
00:03:57.720,00:03:59.820,"which is the record back in 2016."
00:03:59.820,00:04:01.680,"So three oh one seven three."
00:04:01.680,00:04:05.460,"- At its core, expertise is about recognition."
00:04:05.460,00:04:07.950,"Magnus Carlsen recognizes chess positions"
00:04:07.950,00:04:10.650,"the same way we recognize faces."
00:04:10.650,00:04:13.954,"And recognition leads directly to intuition."
00:04:13.954,00:04:15.930,"If you see an angry face,"
00:04:15.930,00:04:17.580,"you have a pretty good idea"
00:04:17.580,00:04:19.320,"of what's gonna come next."
00:04:19.320,00:04:21.540,"Chess masters recognize board positions"
00:04:21.540,00:04:24.270,"and instinctively know the best move."
00:04:24.270,00:04:27.393,"- Most of the time, I know what to do."
00:04:28.410,00:04:31.383,"I don't have to figure it out."
00:04:32.310,00:04:34.710,"- To develop the long term memory of an expert"
00:04:34.710,00:04:36.440,"takes a long time."
00:04:36.440,00:04:38.550,"10,000 hours is the rule of thumb"
00:04:38.550,00:04:40.560,"popularized by Malcolm Gladwell,"
00:04:40.560,00:04:44.940,"but 10,000 hours of practice by itself is not sufficient."
00:04:44.940,00:04:48.570,"There are four additional criteria that must be met."
00:04:48.570,00:04:51.390,"And in areas where these criteria aren't met,"
00:04:51.390,00:04:54.420,"it's impossible to become an expert."
00:04:54.420,00:04:58.080,"So the first one is many repeated attempts with feedback."
00:04:58.080,00:05:01.410,"Tennis players hit hundreds of fore hands in practice."
00:05:01.410,00:05:03.510,"Chess players play thousands of games"
00:05:03.510,00:05:04.920,"before they're grand masters"
00:05:04.920,00:05:08.580,"and physicists solve thousands of physics problems."
00:05:08.580,00:05:10.080,"Each one gets feedback."
00:05:10.080,00:05:11.370,"The tennis player sees"
00:05:11.370,00:05:14.040,"whether each shot clears the net and is in or out."
00:05:14.040,00:05:16.770,"The chess player either wins or loses the game."
00:05:16.770,00:05:19.980,"And the physicist gets the problem right or wrong."
00:05:19.980,00:05:22.680,"But some professionals don't get repeated experience"
00:05:22.680,00:05:24.600,"with the same sorts of problems."
00:05:24.600,00:05:28.020,"Political scientist, Philip Tetlock picked 284 people"
00:05:28.020,00:05:30.750,"who make their living commenting or offering advice"
00:05:30.750,00:05:32.760,"on political and economic trends."
00:05:32.760,00:05:34.140,"This included journalists,"
00:05:34.140,00:05:35.550,"foreign policy specialists,"
00:05:35.550,00:05:37.920,"economists, and intelligence analysts."
00:05:37.920,00:05:39.030,"Over two decades,"
00:05:39.030,00:05:40.800,"he peppered them with questions like"
00:05:40.800,00:05:42.810,"Would George Bush be re-elected?"
00:05:42.810,00:05:45.690,"Would apartheid in South Africa end peacefully?"
00:05:45.690,00:05:48.150,"Would Quebec secede from Canada?"
00:05:48.150,00:05:50.730,"And would the .com bubble burst?"
00:05:50.730,00:05:53.100,"In each case, the pundits rated the probability"
00:05:53.100,00:05:54.930,"of several possible outcomes."
00:05:54.930,00:05:56.130,"And by the end of the study,"
00:05:56.130,00:06:00.690,"Tetlock had quantified 82,361 predictions."
00:06:00.690,00:06:03.000,"So, how did they do?"
00:06:03.000,00:06:04.410,"Pretty terribly."
00:06:04.410,00:06:07.292,"These experts, most of whom had post graduate degrees,"
00:06:07.292,00:06:09.360,"performed worse than if they had just"
00:06:09.360,00:06:12.480,"assigned equal probabilities to all the outcomes."
00:06:12.480,00:06:13.313,"In other words,"
00:06:13.313,00:06:14.490,"people who spend their time"
00:06:14.490,00:06:17.010,"and earned their living studying a particular topic,"
00:06:17.010,00:06:20.130,"produce poorer predictions than random chance."
00:06:20.130,00:06:21.960,"Even in the areas they knew best,"
00:06:21.960,00:06:25.260,"experts were not significantly better than non-specialists."
00:06:25.260,00:06:26.160,"The problem is,"
00:06:26.160,00:06:28.980,"most of the events they have to predict are one-offs."
00:06:28.980,00:06:30.180,"They haven't had the experience"
00:06:30.180,00:06:31.260,"of going through these events"
00:06:31.260,00:06:33.930,"or very similar ones many times before."
00:06:33.930,00:06:36.570,"Even presidential elections only happen infrequently,"
00:06:36.570,00:06:39.330,"and each one in a slightly different environment."
00:06:39.330,00:06:41.850,"So we should be wary of experts"
00:06:41.850,00:06:44.911,"who don't have repeated experience with feedback."
00:06:44.911,00:06:46.320,"(upbeat music)"
00:06:46.320,00:06:49.170,"The next requirement is a valid environment."
00:06:49.170,00:06:50.645,"One that contains regularities"
00:06:50.645,00:06:53.520,"that make it at least somewhat predictable."
00:06:53.520,00:06:55.860,"A gambler betting at the roulette wheel for example,"
00:06:55.860,00:06:58.140,"may have thousands of repeated experiences"
00:06:58.140,00:06:59.100,"with the same event."
00:06:59.100,00:06:59.933,"And for each one,"
00:06:59.933,00:07:00.900,"they get clear feedback"
00:07:00.900,00:07:03.270,"in the form of whether they win or lose,"
00:07:03.270,00:07:05.940,"but you would rightfully not consider them an expert"
00:07:05.940,00:07:08.610,"because the environment is low validity."
00:07:08.610,00:07:10.740,"A roulette wheel is essentially random,"
00:07:10.740,00:07:13.083,"so there are no regularities to be learned."
00:07:13.920,00:07:16.770,"In 2006, legendary investor, Warren Buffet"
00:07:16.770,00:07:18.750,"offered to bet a million dollars"
00:07:18.750,00:07:20.130,"that he could pick an investment"
00:07:20.130,00:07:22.440,"that would outperform Wall Street's best hedge funds"
00:07:22.440,00:07:24.120,"over a 10 year period."
00:07:24.120,00:07:25.380,"Hedge funds are pools of money"
00:07:25.380,00:07:27.300,"that are actively managed by some of the brightest"
00:07:27.300,00:07:29.910,"and most experienced traders on Wall Street."
00:07:29.910,00:07:32.190,"They use advanced techniques like short selling,"
00:07:32.190,00:07:33.420,"leverage, and derivatives"
00:07:33.420,00:07:36.060,"in an attempt to provide outsized returns."
00:07:36.060,00:07:39.150,"And consequently, they charge significant fees."
00:07:39.150,00:07:41.520,"One person took Buffet up on the bet;"
00:07:41.520,00:07:43.890,"Ted Seides of Protege Partners."
00:07:43.890,00:07:46.650,"For his investment, he selected five hedge funds."
00:07:46.650,00:07:49.620,"Well actually, five funds of hedge funds."
00:07:49.620,00:07:53.511,"So in total, a collection of over 200 individual funds."
00:07:53.511,00:07:56.430,"Warren Buffet took a very different approach."
00:07:56.430,00:07:57.840,"He picked the most basic,"
00:07:57.840,00:07:59.760,"boring investment imaginable;"
00:07:59.760,00:08:01.710,"a passive index fund that just tracks"
00:08:01.710,00:08:03.540,"the weighted value of the 500 biggest"
00:08:03.540,00:08:07.050,"public companies in America, the S&amp;P 500."
00:08:07.050,00:08:09.780,"They started the bet on January 1st, 2008,"
00:08:09.780,00:08:12.960,"and immediately things did not look good for Buffet."
00:08:12.960,00:08:15.150,"It was the start of the global financial crisis,"
00:08:15.150,00:08:16.650,"and the market tanked."
00:08:16.650,00:08:19.410,"But the hedge funds could change their holdings"
00:08:19.410,00:08:21.480,"and even profit from market falls."
00:08:21.480,00:08:22.920,"So they lost some value,"
00:08:22.920,00:08:24.954,"but not as much as the market average."
00:08:24.954,00:08:26.670,"The hedge funds stayed ahead"
00:08:26.670,00:08:27.930,"for the next three years,"
00:08:27.930,00:08:31.051,"but by 2011, the S&amp;P 500 had pulled even."
00:08:31.051,00:08:33.870,"And from then on, it wasn't even close."
00:08:33.870,00:08:35.190,"The market average surged"
00:08:35.190,00:08:37.230,"leaving the hedge funds in the dust."
00:08:37.230,00:08:41.610,"After 10 years, Buffet's index fund gained 125.8%"
00:08:41.610,00:08:44.400,"to the hedge funds' 36%."
00:08:44.400,00:08:45.690,"Now the market performance"
00:08:45.690,00:08:47.790,"was not unusual over this time."
00:08:47.790,00:08:49.560,"At eight and a half percent annual growth,"
00:08:49.560,00:08:52.800,"it nearly matches the stock market's long run average."
00:08:52.800,00:08:54.870,"So why did so many investment professionals"
00:08:54.870,00:08:56.610,"with years of industry experience,"
00:08:56.610,00:08:57.840,"research at their fingertips,"
00:08:57.840,00:09:00.180,"and big financial incentives to perform,"
00:09:00.180,00:09:02.040,"fail to beat the market?"
00:09:02.040,00:09:04.860,"Well because stocks are a low validity environment."
00:09:04.860,00:09:05.730,"Over the short term,"
00:09:05.730,00:09:08.520,"stock price movements are almost entirely random."
00:09:08.520,00:09:10.770,"So the feedback, although clear and immediate"
00:09:10.770,00:09:12.150,"doesn't actually reflect anything"
00:09:12.150,00:09:14.283,"about the quality of the decision making."
00:09:15.270,00:09:19.320,"It's closer to a roulette wheel than to Chess."
00:09:19.320,00:09:20.460,"Over a 10 year period,"
00:09:20.460,00:09:24.060,"around 80% of all actively managed investment funds"
00:09:24.060,00:09:26.190,"fail to beat the market average."
00:09:26.190,00:09:27.870,"And if you look at longer time periods,"
00:09:27.870,00:09:30.690,"under performance rises to 90%."
00:09:30.690,00:09:31.523,"And before you say,"
00:09:31.523,00:09:34.770,"""Well that means 10% of managers have actual skill,"
00:09:34.770,00:09:36.420,"consider that just through random chance,"
00:09:36.420,00:09:38.490,"some people would beat the market anyway."
00:09:38.490,00:09:41.010,"Portfolios picked by cats or throwing darts"
00:09:41.010,00:09:42.930,"have been shown to do just that."
00:09:42.930,00:09:44.280,"And in addition to luck,"
00:09:44.280,00:09:45.750,"there are nefarious practices"
00:09:45.750,00:09:48.600,"from insider trading to pump and dump schemes."
00:09:48.600,00:09:51.110,"Now I don't mean to say there are no expert investors."
00:09:51.110,00:09:53.790,"Warren Buffet himself is a clear example."
00:09:53.790,00:09:56.310,"But the vast majority of stock pickers"
00:09:56.310,00:09:57.780,"and active investment managers,"
00:09:57.780,00:10:00.330,"do not demonstrate expert performance"
00:10:00.330,00:10:03.357,"because of the low validity of their environment."
00:10:03.357,00:10:04.740,"Brief side note,"
00:10:04.740,00:10:06.120,"if we know that stock picking"
00:10:06.120,00:10:09.180,"will usually yield worse results over the long term,"
00:10:09.180,00:10:11.490,"and that what active managers charge in fees"
00:10:11.490,00:10:14.172,"is rarely compensated for in improved performance,"
00:10:14.172,00:10:16.200,"then why is so much money"
00:10:16.200,00:10:18.000,"invested in individual stocks,"
00:10:18.000,00:10:20.250,"mutual funds, and hedge funds?"
00:10:20.250,00:10:22.530,"Well let me answer that with a story."
00:10:22.530,00:10:25.350,"There was an experiment carried out with rats and humans,"
00:10:25.350,00:10:27.210,"where there's a red button and a green button"
00:10:27.210,00:10:29.190,"that can each light up."
00:10:29.190,00:10:31.470,"80% of the time, the green button lights up."
00:10:31.470,00:10:34.140,"And 20% of the time the red button lights up,"
00:10:34.140,00:10:35.430,"but randomly."
00:10:35.430,00:10:38.790,"So you can never be sure which button will light."
00:10:38.790,00:10:40.170,"And the task for the subject,"
00:10:40.170,00:10:41.310,"either rat or human,"
00:10:41.310,00:10:43.620,"is to guess beforehand which button will light up"
00:10:43.620,00:10:44.760,"by pressing it."
00:10:44.760,00:10:45.593,"For the rat,"
00:10:45.593,00:10:47.130,"if they guess right, they get a bit of food."
00:10:47.130,00:10:49.601,"And if they guess wrong, a mild electric shock."
00:10:49.601,00:10:52.920,"The rat quickly learns to press only the green button"
00:10:52.920,00:10:55.980,"and accept the 80% win percentage."
00:10:55.980,00:10:57.300,"Humans on the other hand,"
00:10:57.300,00:10:59.040,"usually press the green button."
00:10:59.040,00:11:00.000,"But once in a while,"
00:11:00.000,00:11:02.550,"they try to predict when the red light will go on."
00:11:02.550,00:11:06.360,"And as a result, they guess right only 68% of the time."
00:11:06.360,00:11:08.610,"We have a hard time accepting average results."
00:11:08.610,00:11:11.850,"And we see patterns everywhere, including in randomness."
00:11:11.850,00:11:15.030,"So we try to beat the average by predicting the pattern."
00:11:15.030,00:11:18.900,"But when there is no pattern, this is a terrible strategy."
00:11:18.900,00:11:20.520,"Even when there are patterns,"
00:11:20.520,00:11:23.310,"you need timely feedback in order to learn them."
00:11:23.310,00:11:24.660,"And YouTube knows this,"
00:11:24.660,00:11:25.950,"which is why within the first hour"
00:11:25.950,00:11:27.240,"after posting a video,"
00:11:27.240,00:11:29.430,"they tell you how its performance compares"
00:11:29.430,00:11:31.110,"to your last 10 videos."
00:11:31.110,00:11:32.880,"There's even confetti fireworks"
00:11:32.880,00:11:34.740,"when the video is number one."
00:11:34.740,00:11:36.570,"I know it seems like a silly thing,"
00:11:36.570,00:11:39.510,"but you have no idea how powerful a reward this is"
00:11:39.510,00:11:40.710,"and how much YouTuber effort"
00:11:40.710,00:11:44.250,"is spent chasing this supercharged dopamine hit."
00:11:44.250,00:11:45.780,"To understand the difference between"
00:11:45.780,00:11:47.370,"immediate and delayed feedback,"
00:11:47.370,00:11:49.680,"psychologist Daniel Kahneman contrasts"
00:11:49.680,00:11:53.310,"the experiences of anesthesiologists and radiologists."
00:11:53.310,00:11:55.710,"Anesthesiologists work alongside the patient"
00:11:55.710,00:11:57.300,"and get feedback straight away."
00:11:57.300,00:12:00.390,"Is the patient unconscious with stable vital signs?"
00:12:00.390,00:12:01.920,"With this immediate feedback,"
00:12:01.920,00:12:02.804,"it's easier for them to learn"
00:12:02.804,00:12:05.070,"the regularities of their environment."
00:12:05.070,00:12:06.660,"Radiologists, on the other hand,"
00:12:06.660,00:12:08.910,"don't get rapid feedback on their diagnoses"
00:12:08.910,00:12:10.037,"if they get it at all."
00:12:10.037,00:12:12.870,"This makes it much harder for them to improve."
00:12:12.870,00:12:15.210,"Radiologists typically correctly diagnose"
00:12:15.210,00:12:18.963,"breast cancer from x-rays just 70% of the time."
00:12:18.963,00:12:21.270,"Delayed feedback also seems to be a problem"
00:12:21.270,00:12:24.540,"for college admissions officers and recruitment specialists."
00:12:24.540,00:12:26.070,"After admitting someone to college,"
00:12:26.070,00:12:27.810,"or hiring someone at a big company,"
00:12:27.810,00:12:31.140,"you may never, or only much later find out how they did."
00:12:31.140,00:12:33.360,"This makes it harder to recognize the patterns"
00:12:33.360,00:12:35.130,"in ideal candidates."
00:12:35.130,00:12:35.970,"In one study,"
00:12:35.970,00:12:37.350,"Richard Melton tried to predict"
00:12:37.350,00:12:38.400,"the grades of freshmen"
00:12:38.400,00:12:40.620,"at the end of their first year of college."
00:12:40.620,00:12:42.090,"A set of 14 counselors"
00:12:42.090,00:12:43.230,"interviewed each student"
00:12:43.230,00:12:45.300,"for 45 minutes to an hour."
00:12:45.300,00:12:47.430,"They also had access to high school grades,"
00:12:47.430,00:12:48.810,"several aptitude tests,"
00:12:48.810,00:12:51.270,"and a four page personal statement."
00:12:51.270,00:12:54.060,"For comparison, Melton created an algorithm"
00:12:54.060,00:12:55.380,"that used as input,"
00:12:55.380,00:12:57.300,"only a fraction of the information."
00:12:57.300,00:12:59.940,"Just high school grades and one aptitude test."
00:12:59.940,00:13:02.700,"Nevertheless, the formula was more accurate"
00:13:02.700,00:13:05.088,"than 11 of the 14 counselors."
00:13:05.088,00:13:07.230,"Melton's study was reported alongside"
00:13:07.230,00:13:09.000,"over a dozen similar results"
00:13:09.000,00:13:10.830,"across a variety of other domains,"
00:13:10.830,00:13:12.720,"from predicting who would violate parole"
00:13:12.720,00:13:15.240,"to who'd succeed in pilot training."
00:13:15.240,00:13:16.680,"If you've ever been denied admission"
00:13:16.680,00:13:18.270,"to an educational institution,"
00:13:18.270,00:13:19.710,"or turned down for a job,"
00:13:19.710,00:13:22.200,"it feels like an expert has considered your potential"
00:13:22.200,00:13:24.927,"and decided that you don't have what it takes to succeed."
00:13:24.927,00:13:27.120,"I was rejected twice from film school"
00:13:27.120,00:13:29.190,"and twice from a drama program."
00:13:29.190,00:13:30.240,"So it's comforting to know"
00:13:30.240,00:13:32.160,"that the gatekeepers at these institutions"
00:13:32.160,00:13:34.800,"aren't great predictors of future success."
00:13:34.800,00:13:36.870,"So if you're in a valid environment,"
00:13:36.870,00:13:39.030,"and you get repeated experience with the same events,"
00:13:39.030,00:13:41.700,"with clear, timely feedback from each attempt,"
00:13:41.700,00:13:43.290,"will you definitely become an expert"
00:13:43.290,00:13:45.120,"in 10,000 hours or so?"
00:13:45.120,00:13:47.460,"The answer unfortunately is no."
00:13:47.460,00:13:50.040,"Because most of us want to be comfortable."
00:13:50.040,00:13:51.630,"For a lot of tasks in life,"
00:13:51.630,00:13:54.660,"we can become competent in a fairly short period of time."
00:13:54.660,00:13:56.400,"Take driving a car for example,"
00:13:56.400,00:13:57.870,"initially it's pretty challenging."
00:13:57.870,00:13:59.730,"It takes up all of system two."
00:13:59.730,00:14:02.610,"Bu after 50 hours or so it becomes automatic."
00:14:02.610,00:14:03.570,"System one takes over,"
00:14:03.570,00:14:05.940,"and you can do it without much conscious thought."
00:14:05.940,00:14:08.190,"After that, more time spent driving"
00:14:08.190,00:14:09.990,"doesn't improve performance."
00:14:09.990,00:14:11.220,"If you wanted to keep improving,"
00:14:11.220,00:14:13.440,"you would have to try driving in challenging situations"
00:14:13.440,00:14:17.070,"like new terrain, higher speeds, or in difficult weather."
00:14:17.070,00:14:18.853,"Now I have played guitar for 25 years,"
00:14:18.853,00:14:22.410,"but I'm not an expert because I usually play the same songs."
00:14:22.410,00:14:24.240,"It's easier and more fun."
00:14:24.240,00:14:25.230,"But in order to learn,"
00:14:25.230,00:14:27.750,"you have to be practicing at the edge of your ability,"
00:14:27.750,00:14:29.760,"pushing beyond your comfort zone."
00:14:29.760,00:14:31.063,"You have to use a lot of concentration"
00:14:31.063,00:14:33.810,"and methodically repeatedly attempt things"
00:14:33.810,00:14:35.220,"you aren't good at."
00:14:35.220,00:14:38.940,"- You can practice everything exactly as it is"
00:14:38.940,00:14:41.190,"and exactly as it's written,"
00:14:41.190,00:14:43.680,"but at just such a speed that"
00:14:43.680,00:14:45.180,"you have to think about"
00:14:45.180,00:14:46.860,"and know exactly where you are"
00:14:46.860,00:14:47.693,"and what your fingers are doing"
00:14:47.693,00:14:49.260,"and what it feels like."
00:14:49.260,00:14:51.085,"- This is known as deliberate practice."
00:14:51.085,00:14:52.260,"And in many areas"
00:14:52.260,00:14:54.600,"professionals don't engage in deliberate practice,"
00:14:54.600,00:14:56.310,"so their performance doesn't improve."
00:14:56.310,00:14:58.770,"In fact, sometimes it declines."
00:14:58.770,00:15:00.090,"If you're experiencing chest pain"
00:15:00.090,00:15:01.650,"and you walk into a hospital,"
00:15:01.650,00:15:04.320,"would you rather the doctor is a recent graduate"
00:15:04.320,00:15:06.540,"or someone with 20 years experience?"
00:15:06.540,00:15:07.470,"Researchers have found"
00:15:07.470,00:15:09.180,"that diagnostic skills of medical students"
00:15:09.180,00:15:11.010,"increase with their time in medical school,"
00:15:11.010,00:15:12.000,"which makes sense."
00:15:12.000,00:15:14.070,"The more cases you've seen with feedback,"
00:15:14.070,00:15:15.960,"the better you are at spotting patterns."
00:15:15.960,00:15:17.730,"But this only works up to a point."
00:15:17.730,00:15:20.700,"When it comes to rare diseases of the heart or lungs,"
00:15:20.700,00:15:23.310,"doctors with 20 years experience were actually worse"
00:15:23.310,00:15:25.290,"at diagnosing them than recent graduates."
00:15:25.290,00:15:26.970,"And that's because they haven't thought about"
00:15:26.970,00:15:28.800,"those rare diseases in a long time."
00:15:28.800,00:15:31.320,"So they're less able to recognize the symptoms."
00:15:31.320,00:15:33.060,"Only after a refresher course,"
00:15:33.060,00:15:36.360,"could doctors accurately diagnose these diseases."
00:15:36.360,00:15:38.400,"And you can see the same effect in chess."
00:15:38.400,00:15:40.110,"The best predictor of skill level,"
00:15:40.110,00:15:42.690,"is not the number of games or tournaments played,"
00:15:42.690,00:15:44.310,"but the number of hours dedicated"
00:15:44.310,00:15:46.251,"to serious solitary study."
00:15:46.251,00:15:48.780,"Players spend thousands of hours alone"
00:15:48.780,00:15:49.920,"learning chess theory,"
00:15:49.920,00:15:52.170,"studying their own games and those of others."
00:15:52.170,00:15:53.790,"And they play through compositions,"
00:15:53.790,00:15:54.840,"which are puzzles designed"
00:15:54.840,00:15:56.957,"to help you recognize tactical patterns."
00:15:56.957,00:15:58.830,"In chess, as in other areas,"
00:15:58.830,00:16:00.540,"it can be challenging to force yourself"
00:16:00.540,00:16:02.130,"to practice deliberately."
00:16:02.130,00:16:05.220,"And this is why coaches and teachers are so valuable."
00:16:05.220,00:16:06.840,"They can recognize your weaknesses"
00:16:06.840,00:16:09.450,"and assign tasks to address them."
00:16:09.450,00:16:10.530,"To become an expert,"
00:16:10.530,00:16:12.630,"you have to practice for thousands of hours"
00:16:12.630,00:16:14.040,"in the uncomfortable zone,"
00:16:14.040,00:16:17.280,"attempting the things you can't do quite yet."
00:16:17.280,00:16:19.890,"True expertise is amazing to watch."
00:16:19.890,00:16:22.650,"To me, it looks like magic, but it isn't."
00:16:22.650,00:16:25.230,"At its core, expertise is recognition."
00:16:25.230,00:16:27.540,"And recognition comes from the incredible amount"
00:16:27.540,00:16:28.950,"of highly structured information"
00:16:28.950,00:16:30.810,"stored in long-term memory."
00:16:30.810,00:16:33.420,"To build that memory, requires four things:"
00:16:33.420,00:16:37.110,"a valid environment, many repetitions, timely feedback,"
00:16:37.110,00:16:40.140,"and thousands of hours of deliberate practice."
00:16:40.140,00:16:41.700,"When those criteria are met,"
00:16:41.700,00:16:43.819,"human performance is astonishing."
00:16:43.819,00:16:45.048,"And when it's not,"
00:16:45.048,00:16:47.298,"you get people we think of as experts"
00:16:47.298,00:16:49.431,"who actually aren't."
00:16:49.431,00:16:52.014,"(techno sound)"
00:16:53.880,00:16:56.310,"If you want to become a STEM expert,"
00:16:56.310,00:16:58.620,"you have to actively interact with problems."
00:16:58.620,00:17:00.420,"And that's what you can do with Brilliant,"
00:17:00.420,00:17:01.830,"the sponsor of this video."

00:17:03.540,00:17:05.400,"where you can uncover the optimal strategy"
00:17:05.400,00:17:07.350,"for finding a key in a room."
00:17:07.350,00:17:08.183,"And you quickly learn"
00:17:08.183,00:17:11.490,"how your own strategy can be replicated in a neural network."
00:17:11.490,00:17:13.110,"Logic is another great course"
00:17:13.110,00:17:14.970,"that I find challenges me mentally."
00:17:14.970,00:17:16.620,"You go from thinking you understand something"
00:17:16.620,00:17:18.090,"to actually getting it."
00:17:18.090,00:17:20.280,"And if it feels difficult, that's a good thing."
00:17:20.280,00:17:23.220,"It means you're getting pushed outside your comfort zone."
00:17:23.220,00:17:26.220,"This is how Brilliant facilitates deliberate practice."
00:17:26.220,00:17:27.390,"And if you ever get stuck,"

00:17:32.130,00:17:33.750,"in doing what you know how to do."
00:17:33.750,00:17:36.060,"Build in the habit of being uncomfortable,"
00:17:36.060,00:17:38.340,"and regularly learning something new."
00:17:38.340,00:17:40.890,"That is the way to lifelong learning and growth."
