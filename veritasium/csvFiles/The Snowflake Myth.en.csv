00:00:00.000,00:00:02.320,"- [Ken] Now, I'm gonna turn on 2000 volts."
00:00:02.320,00:00:03.153,"- [Derek] What?"
00:00:03.153,00:00:04.750,"And this is the first step"
00:00:04.750,00:00:06.980,"in creating snowflakes in the lab."
00:00:06.980,00:00:08.611,"This is totally wild."
00:00:08.611,00:00:09.900,"What? - Crazy, huh?"
00:00:09.900,00:00:11.340,"The tips of those needles are"
00:00:11.340,00:00:13.530,"like a hundred nanometers in diameter."
00:00:13.530,00:00:15.760,"- [Derek] That is so wild."
00:00:15.760,00:00:19.000,"Dr. Ken Libbrecht is the snowflake guy."
00:00:19.000,00:00:21.930,"- I was the snowflake consultant for the movie, ""Frozen."""
00:00:21.930,00:00:25.550,"It's okay to conjure snowflakes out of your fingertips,"
00:00:25.550,00:00:27.420,"but they have to be real snowflakes,"
00:00:27.420,00:00:28.854,"or people aren't buying it."
00:00:28.854,00:00:30.370,"(Ken and Derek laughing)"
00:00:30.370,00:00:34.470,"The US Post Office made snowflake stamps using my pictures."
00:00:34.470,00:00:36.390,"It's not the kind of thing you normally think of"
00:00:36.390,00:00:37.960,"when you start doing physics,"
00:00:37.960,00:00:39.670,"that you'd be on a postage stamp."
00:00:39.670,00:00:42.360,"- [Derek] You've written the book on snowflakes, literally."
00:00:42.360,00:00:45.040,"- So I had like two successful books in a row,"
00:00:45.040,00:00:47.070,"so we just kept making books,"
00:00:47.070,00:00:50.260,"until finally (laughing) they sold zero copies,"
00:00:50.260,00:00:51.260,"and then we stopped."
00:00:52.319,00:00:54.870,"(dramatic orchestral music)"
00:00:54.870,00:00:57.233,"- So, are you kind of like a snowflake artist?"
00:00:59.956,00:01:01.523,"- I call it a designer snowflake."
00:01:06.600,00:01:09.040,"Because yes, I am designing this on the fly."
00:01:09.040,00:01:11.490,"I don't have a computer that does all this for me."
00:01:11.490,00:01:13.953,"I just do it by hand, so every one's a little different."
00:01:26.870,00:01:29.090,"- [Derek] Ken knows so much about snowflakes,"
00:01:29.090,00:01:33.370,"he can design and construct them to his own specifications."
00:01:33.370,00:01:35.270,"- [Ken] So what's happening now is it's growing"
00:01:35.270,00:01:37.560,"and doing its thing at some..."
00:01:37.560,00:01:41.660,"It's at -13 Celsius now, but I want to make some branches."
00:01:41.660,00:01:43.760,"I'll just turn this down to -15."
00:01:43.760,00:01:46.130,"And then I'm gonna increase the humidity a little bit,"
00:01:46.130,00:01:47.610,"the super saturation,"
00:01:47.610,00:01:50.390,"and you'll start to see branches come out there."
00:01:50.390,00:01:52.700,"- [Derek] See you changing those conditions,"
00:01:52.700,00:01:56.270,"just caused the plate to kind of stop and become really--"
00:01:56.270,00:02:00.210,"- I changed the growth conditions to prefer branches."
00:02:00.210,00:02:02.430,"This little thing right there, that little nub,"
00:02:02.430,00:02:05.840,"that's the only thing that touches the sapphire substrate."
00:02:05.840,00:02:08.200,"The rest of this is all growing above."
00:02:08.200,00:02:10.680,"This increases the air flow."
00:02:10.680,00:02:12.020,"Those are droplets forming,"
00:02:12.020,00:02:14.021,"and now I'm really kicking it into gear."
00:02:14.021,00:02:16.610,"(mystical orchestral music)"
00:02:16.610,00:02:17.443,"Now, what I'm gonna do"
00:02:17.443,00:02:19.620,"is I'm gonna turn that humidity down to zero,"
00:02:19.620,00:02:22.770,"so the droplets are starting to recede,"
00:02:22.770,00:02:24.380,"and this will stop growing"
00:02:24.380,00:02:27.728,"and kind of start to facet a little bit."
00:02:27.728,00:02:29.150,"Let's say I want branches again,"
00:02:29.150,00:02:31.830,"now I'm gonna really hammer on it."
00:02:31.830,00:02:33.180,"- [Derek] So you're giving it a lot of moisture."
00:02:33.180,00:02:36.223,"- A lot of moisture now, but you'll see side branches."
00:02:39.980,00:02:42.230,"You really start to feel you understand what's going on,"
00:02:42.230,00:02:44.540,"when you can say, ""Now I'm gonna do this,"""
00:02:44.540,00:02:46.150,"and then it happens."
00:02:46.150,00:02:48.272,"It's fun. I can predict the future."
00:02:48.272,00:02:49.720,"(laughing)"
00:02:49.720,00:02:53.040,"I like to think they're better than nature,"
00:02:53.040,00:02:56.720,"and the reason is that the facets of just sharp."
00:02:56.720,00:02:59.440,"All the edges on these things are just sharp and crisp,"
00:02:59.440,00:03:02.380,"whereas in the sky they have to fall,"
00:03:02.380,00:03:05.300,"and by the time they fall, and you pick them up,"
00:03:05.300,00:03:06.760,"and you put them under a microscope,"
00:03:06.760,00:03:08.350,"they've started to evaporate a little."
00:03:08.350,00:03:12.110,"Boy, these are just, (snaps) bang, just crisp."
00:03:12.110,00:03:14.360,"- [Derek] The first close-up photograph of a snowflake"
00:03:14.360,00:03:17.530,"in the wild was taken in 1885"
00:03:17.530,00:03:21.340,"by American meteorologist, Wilson A. Bentley."
00:03:21.340,00:03:23.700,"It was Bentley who originated the idea"
00:03:23.700,00:03:28.090,"that no two snowflakes are alike, and he would know."
00:03:28.090,00:03:29.370,"Over the course of his life,"
00:03:29.370,00:03:32.760,"he took more than 5,000 photos of snowflakes,"
00:03:32.760,00:03:35.950,"a selection of which appear in his book, ""Snow Crystals,"""
00:03:35.950,00:03:39.400,"which is still in print today."
00:03:39.400,00:03:41.170,"But most snowflakes don't look"
00:03:41.170,00:03:43.100,"like the ones Bentley photographed,"
00:03:43.100,00:03:47.090,"because he selected only those in pristine condition"
00:03:47.090,00:03:50.150,"with uncommon beauty and symmetry."
00:03:50.150,00:03:51.800,"- I mean, when you're looking for snowflakes,"
00:03:51.800,00:03:53.468,"I'll take a big piece of cardboard,"
00:03:53.468,00:03:54.760,"and you just glance at it."
00:03:54.760,00:03:56.390,"(exhaling)"
00:03:56.390,00:03:59.393,"Crap, nothing, brush them aside, more."
00:04:00.400,00:04:03.700,"No, each brush is a thousand snowflakes."
00:04:03.700,00:04:05.170,"They're hard to find."
00:04:05.170,00:04:07.370,"They're one in a million, I mean, literally."
00:04:07.370,00:04:10.190,"- [Derek] We are all so used to seeing pictures like this,"
00:04:10.190,00:04:13.990,"that we are blind to the mysteries of the snowflake."
00:04:13.990,00:04:18.110,"Like, why do they all have six fold, radial symmetry?"
00:04:18.110,00:04:20.180,"Why are they so intricate,"
00:04:20.180,00:04:22.650,"and yet so different from each other?"
00:04:22.650,00:04:25.000,"How do opposite arms of a snowflake"
00:04:25.000,00:04:27.440,"mirror each other so perfectly?"
00:04:27.440,00:04:30.130,"I mean, how does one side of the snowflake know"
00:04:30.130,00:04:32.630,"what the other side is doing?"
00:04:32.630,00:04:35.320,"And why are snowflakes flat?"
00:04:35.320,00:04:37.570,"They're usually millimeters in diameter,"
00:04:37.570,00:04:39.380,"but micro meters thick."
00:04:39.380,00:04:43.730,"The edges of a plate can be as narrow as razorblades,"
00:04:43.730,00:04:46.390,"but the mystery goes even deeper."
00:04:46.390,00:04:49.010,"Everyone pictures snowflakes like this,"
00:04:49.010,00:04:52.420,"but the truth is they take all sorts of different forms,"
00:04:52.420,00:04:54.740,"like this, a hollow column."
00:04:54.740,00:04:55.573,"That is a snowflake?"
00:04:55.573,00:04:57.550,"- [Dr. Libbrecht] That is a snowflake."
00:04:57.550,00:05:02.420,"- [Derek] There are also needles, cups and bullets."
00:05:02.420,00:05:04.500,"- This is like my favorite kind of snowflake."
00:05:04.500,00:05:05.730,"It is a capped column."
00:05:05.730,00:05:07.950,"It started out growing as a column,"
00:05:07.950,00:05:09.440,"but then the temperature changed,"
00:05:09.440,00:05:12.047,"and then you've got plates growing on either end."
00:05:12.047,00:05:15.547,"(bright orchestral music)"
00:05:18.350,00:05:20.640,"It's just a cacophony of different shapes."
00:05:20.640,00:05:22.610,"All of these appear spontaneously."
00:05:22.610,00:05:25.360,"There's no DNA or any kind of a blueprint"
00:05:25.360,00:05:26.193,"for what's going on."
00:05:26.193,00:05:28.550,"It's just water vapor freezing into ice,"
00:05:28.550,00:05:29.530,"and all this happens."
00:05:29.530,00:05:31.130,"- [Derek] So you've identified"
00:05:31.130,00:05:34.250,"35 different types of snowflakes."
00:05:34.250,00:05:36.770,"- Yes, there's no really one way"
00:05:36.770,00:05:39.570,"to define a type of snowflake."
00:05:39.570,00:05:42.760,"The first chart of snowflakes is like 41, I think,"
00:05:42.760,00:05:45.487,"and then it got bigger - 60 or 70,"
00:05:45.487,00:05:48.800,"and the latest one by some Japanese physicists,"
00:05:48.800,00:05:52.460,"I think had 108 different types of snowflakes,"
00:05:52.460,00:05:54.959,"and I found 108 was too many."
00:05:54.959,00:05:56.504,"(Ken laughs)"
00:05:56.504,00:05:57.500,"(snow blowing)"
00:05:57.500,00:06:01.441,"- [Derek] How does simple ice create so many distinct forms?"
00:06:01.441,00:06:04.510,"(curious orchestral music)"
00:06:04.510,00:06:07.670,"All snowflakes form in much the same way."
00:06:07.670,00:06:10.030,"Water evaporates into water vapor,"
00:06:10.030,00:06:13.040,"individual molecules bouncing around in the atmosphere,"
00:06:13.040,00:06:14.660,"and as this vapor rises,"
00:06:14.660,00:06:17.690,"it cools and becomes super saturated,"
00:06:17.690,00:06:20.110,"meaning there are more water molecules in the air"
00:06:20.110,00:06:23.640,"than there would be in equilibrium at this temperature."
00:06:23.640,00:06:26.240,"Water molecules condense onto dust particles"
00:06:26.240,00:06:28.260,"to form tiny droplets."
00:06:28.260,00:06:30.850,"And although the temperature may be below freezing,"
00:06:30.850,00:06:33.830,"the droplets don't immediately freeze,"
00:06:33.830,00:06:37.900,"but at some point, one droplet will freeze."
00:06:37.900,00:06:41.380,"Inside, the water molecules lock into place,"
00:06:41.380,00:06:44.460,"forming a hexagonal crystal."
00:06:44.460,00:06:47.270,"This structure results from the peculiarities"
00:06:47.270,00:06:48.589,"of water molecules."
00:06:48.589,00:06:51.959,"Oxygen atoms attract electrons more than hydrogen."
00:06:51.959,00:06:54.470,"And since the molecule has a bent shape,"
00:06:54.470,00:06:57.600,"it's polar with oxygen being slightly negative,"
00:06:57.600,00:07:00.220,"and the hydrogens, slightly positive."
00:07:00.220,00:07:04.030,"Since unlike charges attract, hydrogen from one molecule"
00:07:04.030,00:07:07.000,"will sit next to an oxygen from another molecule,"
00:07:07.000,00:07:09.770,"forming a so-called hydrogen bond,"
00:07:09.770,00:07:13.333,"and this is what creates the hexagonal molecular lattice."
00:07:14.400,00:07:16.503,"But how does this microscopic lattice"
00:07:16.503,00:07:20.153,"grow into a hexagonal crystal that we can see?"
00:07:21.270,00:07:23.460,"- So you start with a chunk of ice,"
00:07:23.460,00:07:26.630,"and these little guys are meant to be water molecules."
00:07:26.630,00:07:29.370,"And what happens is there are these flat surfaces,"
00:07:29.370,00:07:30.760,"which are the facet surfaces,"
00:07:30.760,00:07:34.560,"and at a molecular scale, they're very smooth and flat."
00:07:34.560,00:07:36.680,"And so when a molecule hits,"
00:07:36.680,00:07:39.730,"a water vapor molecule hits that smooth and flat surface,"
00:07:39.730,00:07:43.070,"it tends to bounce off, whereas here, it's rough."
00:07:43.070,00:07:45.770,"There are a lot of dangling molecular bonds over here."
00:07:45.770,00:07:46.710,"That's a rough surface."
00:07:46.710,00:07:50.020,"And so when these molecules hit, they tend to stick."
00:07:50.020,00:07:51.960,"It's a statistical thing, of course,"
00:07:51.960,00:07:54.380,"but the probabilities are high that they stick here"
00:07:54.380,00:07:56.140,"and low that they stick here."
00:07:56.140,00:07:58.770,"So if you take any shape, and you just let it grow"
00:07:58.770,00:08:02.090,"for a little while, the rough areas fill in,"
00:08:02.090,00:08:04.550,"and the flat areas don't grow very fast,"
00:08:04.550,00:08:06.423,"and you end up with a faceted shape."
00:08:07.580,00:08:10.090,"- [Derek] And that's how we get from the quantum mechanics"
00:08:10.090,00:08:15.090,"that governs a water molecule, to a hexagonal prism of ice."
00:08:15.244,00:08:20.080,"This prism has two basal facets and six prism facets,"
00:08:20.080,00:08:21.730,"which is important."
00:08:21.730,00:08:24.960,"If the basal facets grow fast, you get a column."
00:08:24.960,00:08:28.933,"If the prism facets grow faster, you get a flat snowflake."
00:08:30.060,00:08:31.930,"Once there is a seed crystal,"
00:08:31.930,00:08:34.430,"nearby water droplets evaporate"
00:08:34.430,00:08:38.770,"and deposit water molecules onto the growing snowflake."
00:08:38.770,00:08:42.270,"Since the corners of the hexagonal prism stick out farther"
00:08:42.270,00:08:45.310,"into humid air, they grow faster,"
00:08:45.310,00:08:48.310,"and now they extend even farther,"
00:08:48.310,00:08:52.270,"so they grow even faster in a positive feedback loop."
00:08:52.270,00:08:55.990,"This gives rise to six radial branches."
00:08:55.990,00:08:58.310,"At the corners of these branches,"
00:08:58.310,00:09:01.600,"additional branches can form for the same reason."
00:09:01.600,00:09:04.120,"Around a hundred thousand droplets"
00:09:04.120,00:09:07.050,"are required to make a single snowflake,"
00:09:07.050,00:09:10.453,"and the process usually takes 30 to 45 minutes."
00:09:11.930,00:09:14.170,"In the 1930s, Ukichiro Nakaya"
00:09:14.170,00:09:16.270,"was systematically studying snowflakes"
00:09:16.270,00:09:18.913,"at the University of Hokkaido in Japan."
00:09:18.913,00:09:21.791,"He discovered that the different types of snowflakes"
00:09:21.791,00:09:25.520,"don't all occur under the same conditions."
00:09:25.520,00:09:27.320,"Instead, two factors,"
00:09:27.320,00:09:30.380,"the temperature and level of super saturation"
00:09:30.380,00:09:33.400,"determine what type of snowflake grows."
00:09:33.400,00:09:37.460,"His findings are summarized in the Nakaya Diagram,"
00:09:37.460,00:09:40.070,"but it's not a simple pattern."
00:09:40.070,00:09:43.391,"Around -2 Celsius, you get plates."
00:09:43.391,00:09:47.260,"At -5 Celsius, columns and needles form."
00:09:47.260,00:09:50.440,"At -15 Celsius, it's plates again,"
00:09:50.440,00:09:54.690,"and then below -20, you get columns and plates."
00:09:54.690,00:09:56.690,"The Nakaya Diagram allows us"
00:09:56.690,00:10:00.360,"to understand a rough history of any snowflake."
00:10:00.360,00:10:05.360,"Does each snowflake in essence reveal its history"
00:10:06.520,00:10:07.904,"through its shape?"
00:10:07.904,00:10:10.270,"- Yeah, absolutely, to some degree."
00:10:10.270,00:10:12.117,"You can definitely look at a snowflake and say,"
00:10:12.117,00:10:13.947,"""Yeah, I know what conditions"
00:10:13.947,00:10:16.560,"""that crystal grew under, more or less."""
00:10:16.560,00:10:19.390,"Your typical weather patterns, fronts, cold front,"
00:10:19.390,00:10:20.870,"that produces a lot of capped columns,"
00:10:20.870,00:10:23.350,"because as the cloud moves up, it starts to get colder"
00:10:23.350,00:10:28.350,"and initially start to freeze at around -6, -10."
00:10:28.490,00:10:30.820,"That makes columns, and as it gets colder,"
00:10:30.820,00:10:33.160,"then it makes branches and plates,"
00:10:33.160,00:10:35.610,"and so you get capped columns."
00:10:35.610,00:10:36.890,"- [Derek] This also explains"
00:10:36.890,00:10:39.120,"why snowflakes are so intricate."
00:10:39.120,00:10:42.310,"The temperature and humidity at each moment of growth"
00:10:42.310,00:10:45.356,"determines the structures formed in that moment."
00:10:45.356,00:10:48.580,"The symmetry you see is not because one side"
00:10:48.580,00:10:51.280,"somehow knows what the other side is doing,"
00:10:51.280,00:10:53.970,"but because both sides of a single snowflake grow"
00:10:53.970,00:10:56.300,"in the exact same conditions."
00:10:56.300,00:10:59.300,"- When the crystal changes its position,"
00:10:59.300,00:11:00.830,"the temperature will change, say,"
00:11:00.830,00:11:04.480,"and all six branches will see the same temperature change,"
00:11:04.480,00:11:06.603,"and so they'll all respond the same way."
00:11:08.180,00:11:10.380,"- [Derek] Different snowflakes, on the other hand,"
00:11:10.380,00:11:12.370,"each take a unique path,"
00:11:12.370,00:11:15.650,"and therefore they experience a unique set of conditions,"
00:11:15.650,00:11:18.523,"which is why no two snowflakes are alike."
00:11:19.890,00:11:23.330,"But in the lab, you can carefully control the conditions,"
00:11:23.330,00:11:25.410,"so theoretically it should be possible"
00:11:25.410,00:11:30.410,"to create almost identical snowflakes, and indeed, Ken has."
00:11:30.920,00:11:32.159,"What's in here?"
00:11:32.159,00:11:34.600,"- Poke your flashlight in there, and you'll see."
00:11:34.600,00:11:36.420,"- [Derek] Ah ha, I'm imagining"
00:11:36.420,00:11:37.960,"these are seed crystals of a sort?"
00:11:37.960,00:11:40.400,"- [Ken] Those are a little sparkly snow crystals."
00:11:40.400,00:11:41.233,"- [Derek] Yeah."
00:11:41.233,00:11:42.610,"- You know this is another little chamber."
00:11:42.610,00:11:43.970,"It's just a cold plate,"
00:11:43.970,00:11:47.000,"and there's a little sapphire disc in there,"
00:11:47.000,00:11:49.320,"and then I'm going to push this thing, my sapphire,"
00:11:49.320,00:11:52.570,"all the way in here, and the crystals will waft onto to it"
00:11:52.570,00:11:54.313,"and hopefully stay there."
00:11:55.260,00:11:56.490,"The idea popped in, it's like,"
00:11:56.490,00:11:58.090,"oh, if I grow two next to one another,"
00:11:58.090,00:11:59.860,"they'll be kind of identical,"
00:11:59.860,00:12:02.470,"and I call them identical twin snowflakes,"
00:12:02.470,00:12:04.560,"'cause they're like identical twin people."
00:12:04.560,00:12:06.040,"They're not exactly the same,"
00:12:06.040,00:12:09.140,"but clearly more alike than you would ever expect."
00:12:09.140,00:12:12.640,"(gentle orchestral music)"
00:12:17.400,00:12:19.678,"Is it really true that no two snowflakes are alike?"
00:12:19.678,00:12:21.246,"You know, that's just a silly question."
00:12:21.246,00:12:22.480,"(Ken laughs)"
00:12:22.480,00:12:25.900,"It's silly because no two trees are like,"
00:12:25.900,00:12:29.390,"no two grains of sand are like, no two anything are alike."
00:12:29.390,00:12:31.510,"Anything that has any complexity"
00:12:31.510,00:12:33.170,"is different from everything else,"
00:12:33.170,00:12:36.487,"because once you introduce complexity,"
00:12:36.487,00:12:40.250,"then there's just an uncountable number of ways to make it."
00:12:40.250,00:12:41.900,"- [Derek] If a pair of twins snowflakes"
00:12:41.900,00:12:43.870,"are growing too close together,"
00:12:43.870,00:12:46.890,"they end up competing for moisture between them,"
00:12:46.890,00:12:49.123,"stunting both of their growths."
00:12:50.290,00:12:53.410,"The Nakaya Diagram allows us to understand a lot"
00:12:53.410,00:12:55.240,"about snowflake formation."
00:12:55.240,00:12:56.750,"Ken has used his experiments"
00:12:56.750,00:12:59.164,"to build his own version of the chart."
00:12:59.164,00:13:00.840,"But what it doesn't explain"
00:13:00.840,00:13:04.290,"is why do ice crystals form this way in the first place?"
00:13:04.290,00:13:07.450,"I mean, why do we get plates and then columns"
00:13:07.450,00:13:10.420,"and then plates and columns again?"
00:13:10.420,00:13:11.920,"This has been a mystery,"
00:13:11.920,00:13:14.300,"essentially since Nakaya introduced his diagram"
00:13:14.300,00:13:19.140,"back in the 1930s, but Ken believes he now has an answer."
00:13:19.140,00:13:20.820,"Anytime you have a crystal,"
00:13:20.820,00:13:24.420,"the reason why you get these smooth flat facets"
00:13:24.420,00:13:28.090,"is because it's not easy to grow more crystal on top."
00:13:28.090,00:13:30.880,"There are so-called nucleation barriers."
00:13:30.880,00:13:33.800,"What you need is a critical density of additional molecules"
00:13:33.800,00:13:36.110,"of the substance before they can come together"
00:13:36.110,00:13:39.640,"to form a little island that is stable enough to grow"
00:13:39.640,00:13:42.407,"and add another layer onto the crystal."
00:13:42.407,00:13:44.420,"When you're first forming a snowflake,"
00:13:44.420,00:13:46.980,"you're always gonna start with a hexagonal prism"
00:13:46.980,00:13:48.810,"with its two basal facets"
00:13:48.810,00:13:51.313,"and six prism facets around the side."
00:13:51.313,00:13:53.970,"And the nucleation barrier for the basal facets"
00:13:53.970,00:13:56.980,"is different than that of the prism facets."
00:13:56.980,00:13:59.770,"If the nucleation barrier is lower for the prism facets,"
00:13:59.770,00:14:03.220,"then they grow faster, and you get plate like structures."
00:14:03.220,00:14:05.820,"If the nucleation barrier is lower for the basal facets,"
00:14:05.820,00:14:07.000,"then they grow faster,"
00:14:07.000,00:14:09.610,"and you end up with column-like structures."
00:14:09.610,00:14:11.690,"Now, the nucleation barriers of ice"
00:14:11.690,00:14:14.240,"are known as a function of temperature,"
00:14:14.240,00:14:17.430,"and this explains why around -2,"
00:14:17.430,00:14:20.160,"the prism facets grow faster, and you get plates,"
00:14:20.160,00:14:23.240,"because their nucleation barrier is lower."
00:14:23.240,00:14:26.065,"You can also see why below -20 or so,"
00:14:26.065,00:14:27.790,"well then you get columns,"
00:14:27.790,00:14:30.730,"because the basal facet nucleation barrier is lower"
00:14:30.730,00:14:32.330,"at those temperatures."
00:14:32.330,00:14:35.370,"But what doesn't make sense is why we should get columns"
00:14:35.370,00:14:39.673,"at around -5 Celsius and then plates again at -15."
00:14:40.508,00:14:42.560,"So what is happening?"
00:14:42.560,00:14:45.580,"Well Ken's hypothesis is that these nucleation barriers"
00:14:45.580,00:14:48.440,"are valid only for large flat facets,"
00:14:48.440,00:14:50.640,"but if you had really narrow facets,"
00:14:50.640,00:14:53.050,"well, the nucleation barriers would be different."
00:14:53.050,00:14:55.810,"So Ken proposes that narrow basal facets"
00:14:55.810,00:14:59.690,"have a dip in their nucleation barrier around -4 Celsius,"
00:14:59.690,00:15:03.150,"and narrow prism facets have a dip at -15,"
00:15:03.150,00:15:06.990,"so his hypothesis is that the graph should look like this."
00:15:06.990,00:15:09.640,"This then is consistent with all the different forms"
00:15:09.640,00:15:12.380,"of snowflakes that grow at different temperatures."
00:15:12.380,00:15:14.990,"But what accounts for these dips?"
00:15:14.990,00:15:17.700,"Well, let's say we have a narrow prism facet,"
00:15:17.700,00:15:20.340,"so we're growing a plate snowflake."
00:15:20.340,00:15:22.960,"Water molecules that hit the basal facets"
00:15:22.960,00:15:25.280,"are unlikely to reach the critical density required"
00:15:25.280,00:15:27.360,"to overcome the nucleation barrier,"
00:15:27.360,00:15:30.140,"so that surface grows only slowly."
00:15:30.140,00:15:33.270,"But on either side of this narrow prism facet,"
00:15:33.270,00:15:36.400,"water molecules can stick on the rough edges,"
00:15:36.400,00:15:38.150,"and to minimize surface energy,"
00:15:38.150,00:15:41.980,"the ideal shape of this face would be semicircular."
00:15:41.980,00:15:45.590,"But if only the top few layers of water molecules are mobile"
00:15:45.590,00:15:47.480,"to try to lower the surface energy,"
00:15:47.480,00:15:50.450,"many of them diffuse onto the prism facet"
00:15:50.450,00:15:51.430,"and in the process,"
00:15:51.430,00:15:53.360,"they exceed the critical density required"
00:15:53.360,00:15:55.370,"to overcome the nucleation barrier,"
00:15:55.370,00:15:58.890,"and so they can grow the crystal on the prism facet."
00:15:58.890,00:16:01.600,"So due to this narrow edge, the nucleation barrier"
00:16:01.600,00:16:03.770,"is effectively lower than it would be"
00:16:03.770,00:16:06.350,"for a large prism facet."
00:16:06.350,00:16:08.700,"A similar effect happens for the basal facets,"
00:16:08.700,00:16:10.727,"just at a different temperature."
00:16:10.727,00:16:13.110,"And Ken has done experiments to investigate"
00:16:13.110,00:16:16.200,"whether these effects are observed in the lab."
00:16:16.200,00:16:19.280,"- And so I did a series of experiments using that apparatus"
00:16:19.280,00:16:21.979,"and man, it's just like, boom, just like that."
00:16:21.979,00:16:23.603,"(laughing) Whoa!"
00:16:24.680,00:16:26.830,"When you make a model,"
00:16:26.830,00:16:29.340,"and you sort of find it's supposed to do something,"
00:16:29.340,00:16:33.880,"and it sorta does, it's just like, this might be right!"
00:16:33.880,00:16:37.380,"- So far, the results agree nicely with the hypothesis."
00:16:37.380,00:16:40.780,"So after 85 years, maybe we now understand"
00:16:40.780,00:16:42.820,"the molecular physics of ice well enough"
00:16:42.820,00:16:45.540,"to finally explain why snowflakes grow"
00:16:45.540,00:16:47.280,"into such a diverse collection"
00:16:47.280,00:16:50.650,"of columnar and plate-like forms."
00:16:50.650,00:16:52.300,"- And I've done a lot of my career"
00:16:52.300,00:16:55.130,"in astronomy and astrophysics."
00:16:55.130,00:16:57.770,"Nobody ever asks you what it's good for, I mean, never."
00:16:57.770,00:16:59.343,"Not even once did anyone say,"
00:16:59.343,00:17:02.704,"""What are those black holes gonna be used for?"" No,"
00:17:02.704,00:17:04.000,"(Ken and Derek laughing)"
00:17:04.000,00:17:06.847,"Saturn's rings, ""Why do you care about Saturn's rings?"
00:17:06.847,00:17:09.110,"""What's the motivation for studying Saturn,"""
00:17:09.110,00:17:10.350,"nobody asks that."
00:17:10.350,00:17:12.017,"Every time I give a talk, people are like,"
00:17:12.017,00:17:15.110,"""What are you doing? What on earth is this for?"""
00:17:15.110,00:17:17.090,"I'll tell you the real reason,"
00:17:17.090,00:17:19.330,"the real reason that I got into this."
00:17:19.330,00:17:21.097,"You look at a snowflake and you kind of go,"
00:17:21.097,00:17:24.577,"""Um, actually, (laughs) we don't have any idea"
00:17:24.577,00:17:25.560,"""how that works."""
00:17:25.560,00:17:27.900,"Well, that doesn't work."
00:17:27.900,00:17:29.860,"We have to know how that works, dammit!"
00:17:29.860,00:17:30.700,"Well, I want to be the guy"
00:17:30.700,00:17:33.070,"that figures out how snowflakes work."
00:17:33.070,00:17:34.410,"That's always been a driver."
00:17:34.410,00:17:37.360,"You know, as a scientist, you want to figure something out."
