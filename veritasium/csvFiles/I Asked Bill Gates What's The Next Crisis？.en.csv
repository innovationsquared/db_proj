00:00:00.080,00:00:03.760,"Derek: So how did it feel to make this prediction and then"
00:00:03.760,00:00:07.919,"have the world essentially not listen and not prepare?"
00:00:07.919,00:00:12.488,"Bill Gates: Well there's no good feeling that comes on something like this saying i told you so"
00:00:12.488,00:00:16.000,"If anything kills over 10 million people"
00:00:16.000,00:00:19.920,"in the next few decades, it's most likely to be a highly"
00:00:19.920,00:00:23.326,"infectious virus rather than a war."
00:00:23.326,00:00:27.356,"You know I just think back and could I have been more persuasive?"
00:00:27.356,00:00:33.280,"We've actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic."
00:00:33.280,00:00:36.538,"We're not ready for the next epidemic."
00:00:36.538,00:00:39.437,"Derek: How did you make such a prescient prediction?"
00:00:39.437,00:00:41.242,"How did you know this was going to happen?"
00:00:41.242,00:00:43.826,"BG: Well there's a number of respiratory viruses"
00:00:43.826,00:00:50.903,"and from time to time one will come along that's very transmissive and causes some level of fatalities."
00:00:50.903,00:00:53.680,"Respiratory diseases are very scary"
00:00:53.680,00:00:59.199,"because you're still walking around on a plane, a bus when you're infectious"
00:00:59.199,00:01:02.399,"unlike some other diseases like ebola where you're mostly"
00:01:02.399,00:01:05.920,"in a hospital bed by the time the viral load"
00:01:05.920,00:01:07.905,"infects other people."
00:01:07.905,00:01:10.960,"Derek: Hey, so recently i got the chance to interview"
00:01:10.960,00:01:14.240,"Bill Gates when his foundation's annual letter came out"
00:01:14.240,00:01:18.080,"I'll link to it in the description and we talked about lots of things including"
00:01:18.080,00:01:22.159,"conspiracy theories and misinformation but about the pandemic i wanted to know"
00:01:22.159,00:01:26.240,"if so many people could see this coming and the costs of prevention were"
00:01:26.240,00:01:30.539,"relatively small then why wasn't more done about it?"
00:01:30.539,00:01:35.607,"BG: Well there's some risks like earthquakes where we see small earthquakes all the time."
00:01:35.607,00:01:38.840,"Or you know the history of war or fire or"
00:01:38.840,00:01:40.924,"hurricanes so you don't forget."
00:01:40.924,00:01:44.504,"These pandemics only come along so irregularly "
00:01:44.504,00:01:48.079,"that being lulled into a sense of security where it probably won't be a"
00:01:48.079,00:01:52.159,"problem in the next few years, why should we put money into that?"
00:01:52.159,00:01:55.417,"You don't buy the insurance policy, basically."
00:01:55.417,00:02:00.228,"This one will help us understand it needs to be a priority."
00:02:00.228,00:02:03.680,"Derek: I feel like humans have an issue though with fighting the last battle"
00:02:03.680,00:02:07.680,"potentially, so if we focus on pandemics now and there"
00:02:07.680,00:02:09.699,"isn't one say for another hundred years"
00:02:09.699,00:02:14.089,"What is the next disaster? What is the one that we're not prepared for?"
00:02:14.089,00:02:15.726,"BG: Well I'd point out two:"
00:02:15.726,00:02:17.479,"One is climate change."
00:02:17.479,00:02:18.800,"Every year that would be a death toll"
00:02:18.800,00:02:22.160,"even greater than we've had in this pandemic."
00:02:22.160,00:02:26.239,"Also, related to pandemics is something people don't like to talk about much"
00:02:26.239,00:02:30.640,"which is bioterrorism, that somebody who wants to cause damage could"
00:02:30.640,00:02:34.800,"engineer a virus and so that means the cost"
00:02:34.800,00:02:38.959,"the chance of running into this is more than just the naturally cost"
00:02:38.959,00:02:41.557,"epidemics like the current one."
00:02:41.557,00:02:42.514,"Derek: It feels to me like"
00:02:42.514,00:02:46.879,"there's something similar about pandemics and you know climate change or"
00:02:46.879,00:02:50.000,"like asteroid impact, which is that you know they're not very"
00:02:50.000,00:02:52.415,"tangible but you could do a little bit. "
00:02:52.415,00:02:53.440,"I don't know it seems like humans are not"
00:02:53.440,00:02:55.526,"very good at those sorts of problems."
00:02:55.526,00:02:59.519,"BG: Well my favorite writer, Vaclav Smil, you know wrote about all the potential"
00:02:59.519,00:03:04.080,"kinds of disasters like you know the risk of an asteroid, the risk of a"
00:03:04.080,00:03:08.720,"you know yellowstone-like eruption and in fact he showed that pandemics"
00:03:08.720,00:03:12.000,"were significantly the biggest thing other than a"
00:03:12.000,00:03:17.440,"human-caused nuclear war that we needed to be more prepared for"
00:03:17.440,00:03:23.200,"Derek: So what changes do we put in place to be readier for the next one and"
00:03:23.200,00:03:27.044,"is it possible that covid-19 could be the last global pandemic?"
00:03:27.044,00:03:32.480,"BG: Well certainly there will be more pandemics.  The ways that humans interact with other"
00:03:32.480,00:03:38.080,"species, these viruses are coming across a species barrier whether it's from bats"
00:03:38.080,00:03:40.671,"or monkeys or"
00:03:40.671,00:03:44.080,"Derek: but you don't think we could increase our preparedness to such a level that"
00:03:44.080,00:03:47.280,"it never sort of becomes this global issue?"
00:03:47.280,00:03:51.120,"BG: We could increase our preparedness so we never have a death toll"
00:03:51.120,00:03:53.906,"uh anywhere near what we have today. "
00:03:53.906,00:03:56.000,"You know pandemics can be worse in terms of"
00:03:56.000,00:04:01.680,"the fatalities. Smallpox was a over 30 per cent fatality. You know so a little"
00:04:01.680,00:04:04.640,"bit we were lucky that the fatality here is not"
00:04:04.640,00:04:08.640,"not super high but we can nip it in the bud it'll still"
00:04:08.640,00:04:12.400,"get to a lot of countries but the number of deaths you know"
00:04:12.400,00:04:16.560,"uh with the right system should be a tenth of what we we've seen here."
00:04:16.560,00:04:20.639,"Derek: And the systems that you want to put in place so this"
00:04:20.639,00:04:24.000,"sort of so you can nip it in the bud or so what are the key elements"
00:04:24.000,00:04:26.451,"that we didn't have that we should have going forward? "
00:04:26.451,00:04:28.318,"BG: I would divide it into two sections:"
00:04:28.318,00:04:32.320,"There's the field based activity and the R&amp;D activity."
00:04:32.320,00:04:37.759,"In R&amp;D we need to mature mRNA so we can make it even faster and have"
00:04:37.759,00:04:39.745,"factories all over the world,"
00:04:39.745,00:04:41.745,"have it be cheap and thermal stable."
00:04:41.840,00:04:45.440,"There's a lot that can go into therapeutics including antibodies."
00:04:45.440,00:04:48.560,"On diagnostics having the ability to give"
00:04:48.560,00:04:50.956,"10 million PCR tests a day."
00:04:50.956,00:04:52.956,"Then in terms of the field we need"
00:04:52.960,00:04:56.320,"a lot of diagnostic machines all over the world."
00:04:56.320,00:05:00.960,"We need a team of epidemiologists. So the investments are about equal between"
00:05:00.960,00:05:08.314,"R&amp;D and the the field-based group and information that should beconstantly flowing."
00:05:08.314,00:05:10.534,"Derek: You know I feel like there's a meta-issue"
00:05:10.560,00:05:14.479,"that is kind of above all of these issues which is you know"
00:05:14.479,00:05:17.520,"the way that people connect with reality and figure out what's true and"
00:05:17.520,00:05:20.240,"what's not and you know what information to believe."
00:05:20.240,00:05:23.039,"I've got to say that you know as i was growing up and coming into this"
00:05:23.039,00:05:26.720,"information age it seemed like the Internet and all these tools were going"
00:05:26.720,00:05:29.759,"to make the correct information so much more"
00:05:29.759,00:05:34.960,"easy to access and bring us into a more fact-based world."
00:05:34.960,00:05:38.240,"Instead it doesn't look as though it's bringing us there."
00:05:38.240,00:05:41.520,"I wonder if you shared a similar vision for"
00:05:41.520,00:05:44.800,"you know what the Internet might do for all of us and"
00:05:44.800,00:05:47.840,"i don't know if you have any thoughts about the current state of it you know"
00:05:47.840,00:05:49.564,"how do we deal with this?"
00:05:49.564,00:05:52.661,"BG: Well the internet has done something fantastic"
00:05:52.661,00:05:56.639,"which is if you want to learn you know the people who watch you are"
00:05:56.639,00:05:59.120,"you know getting an opportunity to understand"
00:05:59.120,00:06:03.199,"science and what's going on and that just wasn't there"
00:06:03.199,00:06:07.647,"uh and so for a lot of people they're so much more informed."
00:06:07.647,00:06:11.280,"I mean I have friends who ask me about these variants where I'm just stunned at"
00:06:11.280,00:06:14.560,"how up to date they are with the latest information so"
00:06:14.560,00:06:18.080,"for people who want to learn facts this is a golden age."
00:06:18.080,00:06:21.440,"You know we focus on the negative part with some of these conspiracy theories"
00:06:21.440,00:06:25.600,"and anti-factual things and so because social media is so new"
00:06:25.600,00:06:29.600,"figuring out how you curb that, you know labeling it restrict"
00:06:29.600,00:06:33.964,"the speed of spread of things that are titillating but false."
00:06:33.964,00:06:41.039,"We are missing some good ideas to you know not have this kind of scary"
00:06:41.039,00:06:44.960,"phenomena that in the case of anti-vaccine things may"
00:06:44.960,00:06:48.639,"slow down how quickly we get lots of people"
00:06:48.639,00:06:51.759,"uh to take the vaccine and therefore extend the epidemic and"
00:06:51.759,00:06:55.039,"and cost us in in tens of thousands of lives."
00:06:55.039,00:06:58.080,"Derek: It feels like you're running up against you know kind of that"
00:06:58.080,00:07:02.080,"great American principle of free speech, right? I think it's a great point"
00:07:02.080,00:07:05.120,"that you bring up that you know in the past the problem was kind of scarcity"
00:07:05.120,00:07:08.720,"getting access to this sort of information and now it's sort of a"
00:07:08.720,00:07:13.199,"problem of too much and figuring out which is the good stuff and which is not."
00:07:13.199,00:07:16.319,"BG: Well there are certainly clear things like you know saying"
00:07:16.319,00:07:19.840,"completely false things about you know vaccines but there is kind of a gray"
00:07:19.840,00:07:23.599,"area in the middle that figuring out what the rules are and"
00:07:23.599,00:07:27.130,"who should be the one looking and interpreting those rules"
00:07:27.130,00:07:31.280,"Wow, we are missing that today. You know can you get a group of experts"
00:07:31.280,00:07:35.585,"that are weighing in on these things you don't really want the profit motive involved"
00:07:36.723,00:07:38.720,"But you want"
00:07:38.720,00:07:43.840,"you know expertise and capacity and so you know a few years from now i hope"
00:07:43.840,00:07:50.560,"we're more sophisticated on what or how that line should be drawn"
00:07:50.560,00:07:54.000,"Derek: you know a while back on my second channel I made a video called"
00:07:54.000,00:07:58.960,"Be Hated, which was kind of about my thoughts about pushing back against"
00:07:58.960,00:08:03.199,"misinformation, that we should see anything that is wrong in the world"
00:08:03.199,00:08:07.680,"and we should do our best to fight it so you should not be liked by everyone"
00:08:07.680,00:08:10.400,"because there are some people out there with bad ideas and you should be pushing"
00:08:10.400,00:08:13.919,"back against them. That was essentially my thought but since then I"
00:08:13.919,00:08:16.319,"feel like my views have softened a little"
00:08:16.319,00:08:20.960,"and now I think of our pushing back against misinformation a little bit like"
00:08:20.960,00:08:25.680,"an immune system. Obviously it's a problem if your immune system is weak if"
00:08:25.680,00:08:29.599,"it doesn't respond to anything but it's also a problem if your immune"
00:08:29.599,00:08:34.800,"system is too strong. You know during the 1918 flu pandemic"
00:08:34.800,00:08:38.479,"there's a really interesting distribution of deaths where the young"
00:08:38.479,00:08:40.800,"and old were more likely to die obviously"
00:08:40.800,00:08:46.480,"because they have weak immune systems but also people in the sort of 25 to 35"
00:08:46.480,00:08:50.160,"year-old range because their immune systems were just so strong"
00:08:50.160,00:08:54.160,"they were overactive and that ended up resulting in mortality"
00:08:54.160,00:08:57.920,"so I feel like there's a sweet spot in terms of how much we push back against"
00:08:57.920,00:09:00.880,"misinformation. You know you'll never see me make a"
00:09:00.880,00:09:04.480,"video about flat earthers because i just don't see"
00:09:04.480,00:09:07.760,"the point. You know making that video only kind of"
00:09:07.760,00:09:11.040,"reconfirms their world view and there's not really any minds to move"
00:09:11.040,00:09:14.000,"there so that's kind of how I'm conceptualizing"
00:09:14.000,00:09:17.680,"misinformation these days, a bit like we have to be a targeted immune system."
00:09:17.680,00:09:21.360,"So i wanted to push Bill a bit further"
00:09:21.360,00:09:25.440,"on this idea and I brought up a tweet that I had seen doing the rounds on"
00:09:25.440,00:09:30.000,"twitter that basically said that the Oxford vaccine development, they"
00:09:30.000,00:09:32.720,"were going to open source that vaccine until"
00:09:32.720,00:09:36.080,"the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation got involved and said"
00:09:36.080,00:09:40.560,"no you must partner exclusively with a big pharma company AstraZeneca"
00:09:40.560,00:09:44.000,"and so obviously it seems to the people on twitter that something nefarious was"
00:09:44.000,00:09:48.565,"going on there, but I wanted to know from Bill what was the real story"
00:09:48.565,00:09:52.160,"BG: Well the making a safe vaccine"
00:09:52.160,00:09:56.160,"is more complicated than say making a jet engine"
00:09:56.160,00:10:01.279,"and people are very picky about vaccines in fact you could ruin the"
00:10:01.279,00:10:04.480,"reputation of vaccines if you're making them in factories"
00:10:04.480,00:10:08.480,"where the quality control at every stage is not exquisite."
00:10:08.480,00:10:12.079,"and you know any mistake you know you can have that factory shut down"
00:10:12.079,00:10:15.440,"literally for months at a time when its output is needed to"
00:10:15.440,00:10:20.160,"save millions of lives. So vaccine factories are not"
00:10:20.160,00:10:25.040,"something that you just you know you know like open source code that you"
00:10:25.040,00:10:30.800,"can take and you know mess around with and so the the limitations on"
00:10:30.800,00:10:34.560,"how many vaccines are being made, that's based on how many great"
00:10:34.560,00:10:38.560,"capable vaccine manufacturers there are in the world and we've made sure that"
00:10:38.560,00:10:42.079,"the AstraZeneca's being made in these big indian factories and there's no"
00:10:42.079,00:10:46.160,"royalty for that, no charge at all. Now we've had to fund"
00:10:46.160,00:10:49.440,"that, the Gates Foundation. These are companies we've been working"
00:10:49.440,00:10:52.160,"on their factory quality for over a decade"
00:10:52.160,00:10:56.720,"so that there was spare capacity to make inexpensive vaccines"
00:10:56.720,00:11:03.440,"so Oxford University is is wonderful, but they're not capable of doing a phase"
00:11:03.440,00:11:06.968,"three trial and they they don't have factories"
00:11:06.968,00:11:09.680,"We did tell Oxford that they needed to seek somebody"
00:11:09.680,00:11:14.959,"with expertise and AstraZeneca came in and we didn't"
00:11:14.959,00:11:18.560,"control that agreement but they came in and said hey they want to do it on a"
00:11:18.560,00:11:21.680,"non-profit basis and I'm impressed with how they put"
00:11:21.680,00:11:25.440,"their best people on it and helped out. You know the pharma companies who"
00:11:25.440,00:11:29.120,"didn't get involved nobody's criticizing them. So you know"
00:11:29.120,00:11:31.200,"you feel sorry for the ones that are really"
00:11:31.200,00:11:35.600,"miraculously helping make these vaccines."
00:11:35.600,00:11:38.959,"These are the very good reasons that I suspect exist but"
