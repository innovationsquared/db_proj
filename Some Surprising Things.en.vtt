00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.780
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.920
What's normal? Are you normal?

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.920
Well, today let's bathe our brains with those questions and scrub down with things that are surprising

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.680
and counterintuitive.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.609
What does it mean to be normal

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.359
in the first place?
Well, maybe it just means to be average.

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.410
But an average can be a bit weird, a bit misleading.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.800
For instance, think of this way. The average human has

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.610
one breast and one testicle. Also, the
average person has not climbed to the top

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.240
of Gangkhar Puensum. In fact, no one has.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.260
Gangkhar Puensum is considered the tallest mountain on Earth that has yet

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.280
to be summited. And it's unlikely it ever will be soon.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.030
It lies on the border of China and Bhutan
and local governments believe the area

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.100
to be holy, and no mountaineering or climbing

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.170
is allowed. But don't worry, there are plenty
more. There are at least

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.550
a hundred other recognised peaks that are quite tall

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.949
and remain unsummitted. That's great.

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.140
It's surprising to think that Earth has
so many places that still have yet to be

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.940
conquered or explored. At least, we were all
born here on Earth.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.360
Derek, from the YouTube channel Veritasium,

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.009
where were you born?

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.469
A small Australian town called Traralgon.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.920
But were you really born there?

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.009
I'm suspicious of Derek's answer because saying that you were born on Earth's

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.700
surface, is like saying you were born in a taxicab.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.979
The taxicab may still be around, but is
it in the exact same location that it was

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.450
at the moment of your birth? Probably not.
Like a taxicab,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.270
the Earth is moving, and it's moving quickly.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.960
For one, the Earth is spinning. This is real time
footage of Earth spinning you don't notice

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.640
much movement at all, but that's just

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.930
because Earth is so large. To a distant observer beyond Earth, two seconds from now

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.540
you will be an entire kilometre east
from where you are now.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.240
Earth is also orbiting around the Sun, quickly.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.680
Three days ago, I was in Singapore. From
the reference frame of Earth's surface,

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.010
Singapore is 6,000 kilometres
away from this place.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.830
Sydney, Australia. But, in terms of Earth
orbiting around the Sun,

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.519
three days ago I wasn't just 6,000 kilometres away,

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.540
I was more than 7 million. The point is,

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.630
where you were born, when you were born,

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.220
is now just an empty region of space Earth will never,

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.120
ever return to. My favourite surprise is
the solution to the Three Prisoners problem.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.799
It's related to the Monty Hall
problem but the stakes are higher.

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.590
Its solution is notoriously
counter-intuitive. Let's say that myself,

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.560
Kevin

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.540
and Jake, have been arrested. 
And we are told that tomorrow morning

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.569
two of us will be executed.

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.079
We don't know which two, so it's a terrible night.

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.459
But if I ask a guard to tell me
something about what happens tomorrow

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.180
and the guard says "Michael, I won't tell
you anything about your

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.510
fate and I won't tell you who lives, but I will
tell you this little piece of

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.439
information: tomorrow morning

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.760
Jake is one of the guys who will be executed."

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.519
What a relief(!) I used to have a one
in three chance of being the one who lives,

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.719
but now that I know Jake dies, it's just
between Kevin and I.

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:23.939
My chances of living have gone up

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.760
from 1 in 3 to 1 in 2. This is great.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.799
Well, if I thought that I would actually be

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.159
wrong. In fact, my chances of living
haven't changed at all

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:38.430
and Kevin's are paradoxically now twice
as good as mine.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.190
How can that be? Well, take a look at this.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.800
This circle represents the three possibilities. Either

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.299
tomorrow Jake will live, Kevin will live or

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.799
I will live. The hearts represent life. Isn't that beautiful? Now,

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.979
let's focus on what the guard can tell me.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.640
In the case that Jake is the one who has been
selected to live,

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.060
both Kevin and myself will die tomorrow.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.290
But the guard cannot tell me anything
about myself, and he cannot tell me

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.819
who lives, so if Jake is the one chosen to
survive all the guard can tell me

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.229
is that Kevin will be one of the guys
who dies tomorrow,

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:21.409
that's it. Now, in this case, where Kevin

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:25.639
is the guy selected to live, both myself
and Jake will die tomorrow, but the guard

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:26.960
can't tell me about myself

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.889
and cannot tell me who lives. So all the
guard can say is that tomorrow

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.599
Jake is one of the guys who will die.
Here's where it gets interesting.

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:37.699
If I am the one who has been picked to
live tomorrow,

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.090
the guard has a choice; he can either tell me that Kevin

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.250
is the one who will die tomorrow or he
can tell me

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.530
that Jake is one of the guys who will
die tomorrow.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.600
Well, look at what we've got here. If the guard tells me

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.770
that Jake is one of the guys who will die tomorrow,

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.229
I'm only faced now with these possibilities.

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.900
In one-third of these cases I am the survivor, and in two-thirds of these cases

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.160
Kevin is the survivor. My chances haven't changed

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.489
and Kevin's are now twice as good as mine used to be.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.920
It is a beautiful day here in Sydney.
Before I arrived in Australia

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.950
I was in Singapore, where it was also beautiful

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.140
but incredibly humid. The air felt

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.500
thick to move through and breathe, but in actuality

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.540
humid air is less dense than dry air.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.720
Derek, tell us about Avogadro's Law.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.980
Well, Avogadro came up with the idea that

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.600
in a given volume of gas at a given
temperature and pressure, there will be

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.510
always the same number of gas particles.
Doesn't matter what the gas is,

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.630
if it's helium or nitrogen or oxygen.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.360
And that holds truth for air,

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.900
which is a mixture of gases.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.180
That's right. So, it's got nitrogen and oxygen principally.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.500
But if it's humid air, then you replace
some of those nitrogens and oxygens

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.610
with water. And water is wider

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.010
than the diatomic nitrogen and oxygen that
exists in our atmosphere.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.840
That's right.
Oxygen and nitrogen have masses of 32 and 28,

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.230
whereas water is just 18.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.260
Humid air is actually much less dense than

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.930
dry air. It's lighter and things can move
through it more easily.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.280
This is especially true when it comes to baseballs.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.620
A baseball travels through humid air more easily,

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.410
and further, with the same amount of
energy. If air becomes more humid

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.220
and decreases drag by only five
percent that can mean the difference

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.560
between a fly ball

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.680
and a home run. This became a problem

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.060
when indoor baseball stadiums started to
play around with the idea

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.050
of turning on the air conditioning when
the rival team came up to bat.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.040
Essentially, the air conditioning made the air dryer,

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.190
therefore thicker and made the rival team hit baseballs

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.310
shorter distances.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:55.160
The word normal, by the way, is homological. 
What does that mean? A homological

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.260
adjective describes itself. For instance, the word

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.360
tiny is pretty tiny. It's a small word.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.580
The word unhyphenated is

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:06.820
unhyphenated.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.120
Normal

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.550
is one of the top 1000 most commonly
spoken and written words.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.950
The word normal is normal, it describes itself.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.730
But they're also words that are heterological;
adjectives that

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:26.360
don't describe themselves.
For instance, the word misspelled.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:31.220
Yes, well, if you don't misspell it. 
If you don't misspell it. What about abbreviated?

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.140
Ooo, I like that one, too.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.900
What about German?

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.740
Not a German word. That's a good one.
How about

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.180
monosyllabic? That's heterological

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.710
because it doesn't describe itself.
But polysyllabic? For sure.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.820
I especially love just how homological pentasyllabic is.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.780
Yeah, five syllables. That is genius.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:59.790
Well, it's the way words are. The way they

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:04.310
normally are. But what about you, are you normal?

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.840
Well, a common way of defining normal

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.890
is to say that something about you is
normal, if you fall within just

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.900
one standard deviation of the average for all people.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.000
But there are a lot of things

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.270
about you. You can easily think of, say, 36 different

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.580
independent variables.
Different things to say about yourself.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.930
For instance, how tall you are, how many
friends you have, how bad your breath is

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:37.640
or, say, how often you lie. Now, the statistical
probability that you would be normal

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.690
for all 36 of those different attributes

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:45.690
is actually one in a million.
Which means, mathematically speaking,

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.960
it is quite abnormal to be normal.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.020
And as always,

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.020
thanks for watching.
