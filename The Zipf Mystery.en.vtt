00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:08.350
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. About 6 percent of
everything you say and read and write is

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.970
the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:18.240
"the" - is the most used word in the
English language. About one out of every

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:25.080
16 words we encounter on a daily basis
is "the." The top 20 most common English

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.210
words in order are "the," "of," "and," "to," "a," "in," "is," "I," "that," "it," "for," "you,"

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:39.460
"was," "with," "on," "as," "have," "but," "be," "they."
That's a fun fact. A piece of trivia but it's

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.970
also more. You see, whether the most
commonly used words are ranked across an

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.530
entire language, or in just one book or
article, almost every time a bizarre

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.880
pattern emerges. The second most used
word will appear about half as often as

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.559
the most used. The third one third as
often. The fourth one fourth as often. The

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.640
fifth one fifth as often. The sixth one sixth
as often, and so on all the way down.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.970
Seriously. For some reason, the amount of
times a word is used is just

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.280
proportional to one over its rank. Word
frequency and ranking on a log log graph

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.909
follow a nice straight line. A power-law.
This phenomenon is called Zipf's Law and

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:38.409
it doesn't only apply to English. It also
applies to other languages, like, well,

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:39.380
all of them.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.380
Even ancient languages we haven't been
able to translate yet.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.350
And here's the thing. We have no idea why.
It's surprising that something as

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.390
complex as reality should be conveyed by
something as creative as language in

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.560
such a predictable way. How predictable?
Well, watch this. According to WordCount.org,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.630
which ranks words as found in the
British National Corpus, "sauce" is the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:15.950
5,555th most common English word.
Now, here is a list of how many times

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.360
every word on Wikipedia and in the
entire Gutenberg Corpus of tens of

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.940
thousands of public domain books shows
up. The most used word, 'the,' shows up about

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.470
181 million times. Knowing these two
things, we can estimate that the word

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.540
"sauce" should appear about thirty
thousand times on Wikipedia and

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.220
Gutenberg combined.
And it pretty much does.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.100
What gives? The world is chaotic. Things are
distributed in myriad of ways, not just

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.090
power laws. And language is personal,

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.520
intentional, idiosyncratic. What about the
world and ourselves could cause such

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:08.140
complex activities and behaviors to
follow such a basic rule? We literally

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.740
don't know. More than a century of
research has yet to close the case.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.020
Moreover, Zipf's law doesn't just
mysteriously describe word use. It's

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.810
also found in city populations, solar
flare intensities, protein sequences and

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.460
immune receptors, the amount of traffic
websites get, earthquake magnitudes, the

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.980
number of times academic papers are
cited, last names, the firing patterns of

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.720
neural networks, ingredients used in
cookbooks, the number of phone calls

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.360
people received, the diameter of Moon
craters, the number of people that die

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.620
in wars, the popularity of opening chess
moves, even the rate at which we forget.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:54.780
There are plenty of theories about why
language is 'zipf-y,' but no firm conclusions

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.220
and this video doesn't contain a
definite explanation either. Sorry, I know

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.280
that's a bummer, since we appear to like
knowing more than mystery. But that said,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:13.970
we also ask more than we answer. So
let's dive into Zipf's ramifications, some

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.440
related patterns, some possible
explanations and the depth of the

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.320
mystery itself.
Zipf's law was popularized by George Zipf,

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.660
a linguist at Harvard University. It is a
discrete form of the continuous Pareto

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.070
distribution from which we get the
Pareto Principle. Because so many

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.070
real-world processes behave this way,
the Pareto Principle tells us that, as a rule

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:47.729
of thumb, it's worth assuming that 20% of
the causes are responsible for 80% of

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.020
the outcome,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.349
like in language, where the most
frequently used 18 percent of words

00:04:54.349 --> 00:05:02.060
account for over 80% of word occurrences.
In 1896, Vilfredo Pareto showed that

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.300
approximately 80% of the land in Italy
was owned by just twenty percent of the

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.690
population. It is said that he later
noticed in his garden 20 percent of his

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:20.440
pea pods contained eighty percent of the
peas. He and other researchers looked at

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:26.940
other datasets and found that this 80-20
imbalance comes up a lot in the world.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:35.229
The richest 20% of humans have 82.7% of
the world's income. In the US, 20% of

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:41.050
patients use eighty percent of health
care resources. In 2002, Microsoft

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.610
reported that 80% of the errors and
crashes in Windows and Office are caused

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.659
by 20% of the bugs detected. A common
rule of thumb in the business world

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:57.419
states that 20% of your customers are
responsible for 80% of your profits and

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:02.110
eighty percent of the complaints you
receive will come from 20% of your

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:08.639
customers. A book titled "The 80/20 Principle"
even says that in a home or

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:09.779
office,

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:16.919
20% of the carpet receives 80 percent of
the wear. Oh, and as Woody Allen famously

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:24.909
said, "eighty percent of success is just
showing up." The Pareto Principle is

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:27.699
everywhere, which is good.

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:32.680
By focusing on just 20 percent of what's
wrong, you can often expect to solve

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:38.840
eighty percent of the problems. A variety
of different unrelated factors cause

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.639
this to be true from case to case, but if
we can get to the bottom of what causes

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:44.930
some of them,

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.280
maybe we'll find that one or more of
those mechanisms is responsible for

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.930
Zipf's law in language. George Zipf
himself thought languages' interesting rank

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.979
frequency distribution was a consequence
of the Principle of Least Effort. The

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:07.410
tendency for life and things to follow
the path of least resistance. Zipf believed

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:12.840
it drove much of human behavior and
hypothesized that as language developed

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:18.280
in our species, speakers naturally
preferred drawing from as few words as

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:23.370
possible to get their thoughts out there.
It was easier. But in order to understand

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.599
what was being said,

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:30.990
listeners preferred larger vocabularies
that gave more specificity, so that they

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:36.639
had to do less work. The compromise
between listening and speaking, Zipf felt,

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:43.310
led to the current state of language.
A few words are used often and many many

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.129
many words are used rarely.

00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:52.039
Recent papers have suggested that having
a few short, often used, predictable words

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:57.749
helps dissipate information load density
on listeners, spacing out important vocab

00:07:57.749 --> 00:08:03.239
so that the information rate is more
constant. This makes sense and much has

00:08:03.239 --> 00:08:07.830
been learned by applying the least
effort principle to other behaviors, but

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:13.289
later researchers argued that for
language, the explanation was even more

00:08:13.289 --> 00:08:19.029
simple. Just a few years after Zipf's
seminal paper, Benoit Mandelbrot showed

00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:24.419
that there may be nothing mysterious
about Zipf's law at all, because even if you

00:08:24.419 --> 00:08:29.669
just randomly type on a keyboard you
will produce words distributed according

00:08:29.669 --> 00:08:35.630
to Zipf's law. It's a pretty cool point and
this is why it happens. There are

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:41.769
exponentially more different long words
than short words. For instance, the English

00:08:41.769 --> 00:08:48.970
alphabet can be used to make 26 one
letter words, but 26 squared 2 letter

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:55.709
words. Also, in random typing, whenever the
space bar is pressed a word terminates.

00:08:55.709 --> 00:09:00.939
Since there's always a certain chance that
the space bar will be pressed, longer

00:09:00.939 --> 00:09:03.069
stretches of time before it happens

00:09:03.069 --> 00:09:08.160
are exponentially less likely than
shorter ones. The combination of these

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:14.720
exponentials is pretty 'Zipf-y.'
For example, if all 26 letters and the

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:20.130
spacebar are equally likely to be typed,
after a letter is typed and a word has

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:25.389
begun, the probability that the next
input will be a space, thus creating a

00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:31.579
one letter word, is just one in 27.
And sure enough, if you randomly generate

00:09:31.579 --> 00:09:39.240
characters or hire a proverbial typing
monkey, about one out of every 27 or 3.7

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:44.769
percent of the stuff between spaces,
will be single letters. Two letter words

00:09:44.769 --> 00:09:50.920
appear when after beginning a word any
character but the space bar is hit - a 26

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.620
in 27 chance and then the space bar.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:59.980
A three-letter word is the probability
of a letter, another letter and then a

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:04.350
space. If we divide by the number of
unique words of each length there can be,

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:08.950
we get the frequency of occurrence
expected for any particular word given

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:14.950
its length. For example, the letter V will
make up about 0.142 percent of

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:24.440
random typing. The word "Vsauce"
0.0000000993 percent. Longer words are

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:29.530
less likely, but watch this. Let's spread
these frequencies out according to the

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:35.570
ranks they'd take up on a most often
used list. There are 26 possible one

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:40.640
letter words, so each of the top 26
ranked words are expected to occur

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.940
about this often. The next 676 ranks will be taken up

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:50.700
by two letter words that show up about
this often. If we extend each frequency

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:56.980
according to how many members it has,
we get Zipf. Subsequent researchers have

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:02.160
detailed how changing up the initial
conditions can smooth the steps out. Our

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:08.180
mysterious distribution has been created
out of nothing but the inevitabilities

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.920
of math.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:16.000
So maybe there is no mystery. Maybe words
are just the result of humans randomly

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.339
segmenting the observable world and the
mental world into labels and Zipf's law

00:11:21.339 --> 00:11:26.739
describes what naturally happens when
you do that. Case closed. and as always

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.240
And as always,

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.560
thanks for... wait a minute!

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.420
Actual language is very different from
random typing. Communication is

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.040
deterministic to a certain extent.
Utterances and topics arrive based on

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:46.139
what was said before. And the vocabulary
we have to work with certainly isn't the

00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:51.539
result of purely random naming.
For example, the monkey typing model can't

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:56.440
explain why even the names of the
elements, the planets and the days of the

00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:02.040
week are used in language according to
Zipf's law. Sets like these are constrained

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:06.410
by the natural world and they're not the
result of us randomly segmenting the

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:12.269
world into labels. Furthermore, when given
a list of novel words, words they've

00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:16.670
never heard or used before, like when
prompted to write a story about alien

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:21.930
creatures with strange names, people will
naturally tend to use the name of one

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:29.750
alien twice as often as another, three
times as often as another... Zipf's law appears to

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:35.550
be built into our brains. Perhaps there
is something about the way thoughts and

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:40.529
topics of discussion ebb and flow that
contributes to Zipf's law.

00:12:40.529 --> 00:12:44.839
Another way 'Zipf-ian' distributions
occur is via processes that change

00:12:44.839 --> 00:12:49.300
according to how they've previously
operated. These are called preferential

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:55.209
attachment processes.
They occur when something - money, views,

00:12:55.209 --> 00:12:59.990
attention, variation, friends, jobs,
anything really is given out according

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:05.749
to how much is already possessed.
To go back to the carpet example, if most

00:13:05.749 --> 00:13:11.309
people walk from the living room to the
kitchen across a certain path, furniture

00:13:11.309 --> 00:13:17.990
will be placed elsewhere, making that
path even more popular. The more views

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:22.470
a video or image or post has,
the more likely it is to get recommended

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:28.209
automatically or make the news for
having so many views, both of which give

00:13:28.209 --> 00:13:29.249
it more views.

00:13:29.249 --> 00:13:34.600
It's like a snowball rolling down a
snowy hill. The more snow it accumulates, the

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.949
bigger its surface area becomes for
collecting more and the faster it grows.

00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:43.790
There doesn't have to be a deliberate
choice driving a preferential attachment

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:50.649
process. It can happen naturally. Try this.
Take a bunch of paper clips and grab any

00:13:50.649 --> 00:13:52.170
two at random.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:56.720
Link them together and then throw them
back in the pile. Now, repeat over and

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:02.020
over again. If you grab paper clips that
are already part of a chain, link 'em anyway.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:06.100
More often than not after a while
you will have a distribution that looks

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:11.880
'Zipf-ian.' A small number of chains
contain a disproportionate amount of the

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:16.800
total paperclip count. This is simply
because the longer a chain gets, the

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.290
greater proportion of the whole it
contains, which gives it a better chance

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:26.190
of being picked up in the future and
consequently made even longer. The rich

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:33.420
get richer, the big get bigger,
the popular get popular-er. It's just math.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:39.380
Perhaps languages' Zipf mystery is, if not
caused by it, at least strengthened by

00:14:39.389 --> 00:14:45.900
preferential attachment. Once a word is
used, it's more likely to be used again soon.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.420
Critical points may play a role as well.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:54.560
Writing and conversation often stick to a
topic until a critical point is reached

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.420
and the subject is changed and
the vocabulary shifts. Processes like these

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:05.060
are known to result in power laws. So, in
the end, it seems tenable that all these

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:11.260
mechanisms might collude to make Zipf's
law the most natural way for language to

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:16.970
be. Perhaps some of our vocabulary and
grammar was developed randomly, according

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:22.560
to Mandelbrot's theory. And the natural
way conversation and discussion follow

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.949
preferential attachment and criticality,
coupled with the principle of least

00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:31.920
effort when speaking and listening are
all responsible for the relationship

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.010
between word rank and frequency.

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:40.170
It's a shame that the answer isn't
simpler, but it's fascinating because of

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:45.140
the consequences it has on what
communication is made of. Roughly

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:52.210
speaking, and this is mind blowing, nearly
half of any book, conversation or article

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:58.500
will be nothing but the same 50 to 100
words. And nearly the other half will be

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:04.870
words that appear in that selection only
once. That's not so surprising when you

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:11.690
consider the fact that one word accounts
for 6 percent of what we say. The top 25

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:18.300
most used words make up about a third of
everything we say and the top 100 about

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:25.400
half. Seriously. I mean, whether it's all the
words in "Wet Hot American Summer," or all

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:30.420
the words in Plato's "Complete Works" or
in the complete works of Edgar Allan Poe

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:37.920
or the Bible itself, only about 100 words
are used for nearly half of everything

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:48.360
written or said. In Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland 44% and in Tom Sawyer 49.8%

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:55.260
of the unique words used appear only
once in the book. A word that is used

00:16:55.260 --> 00:17:01.300
only once in a given selection of words
is called a 'hapax legomenon.'

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:06.120
Hapax legomena are vitally important to
understanding languages. If a word has

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:11.699
only been found once in the entire known
collection of an ancient language, it can

00:17:11.699 --> 00:17:17.640
be very difficult to figure out what it
means. Now, there is no corpus of

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:23.550
everything ever said or written in
English, but there are very very large

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:29.240
collections and it's fun to find hapax legomena in them.
For instance, and this

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:34.360
probably won't be the case after I
mention it, but the word "quizzaciously"

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:41.600
is in the Oxford English Dictionary, but
appears nowhere on Wikipedia or in the

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:46.000
Gutenberg corpus or in the British
National Corpus or the American National

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:53.650
Corpus, but it does appear when searched in
just one result on Google. Fittingly, in a

00:17:53.650 --> 00:18:01.730
book titled "ElderSpeak" that lists it
as a 'rare word.' Quizzaciously, by the way,

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:07.600
means "in a mocking manner," as in
"The paradist rattled off quizzaciously,

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:12.919
'Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. But who is Michael
and how much does here

00:18:12.919 --> 00:18:20.590
weigh?'" It's a little sad that quizzaciously
has been used so infrequently. It's a

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:26.910
fun word, but that's the way things go in
a 'Zipf-ian' system. Some things get all the

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:33.540
love, some get little. Most of what you
experience on a day-to-day basis is

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:39.910
forgotten, forgettable. The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows, as it often does, has a

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:45.970
word for this - Olēka - the awareness of how
few days are memorable.

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:52.170
I've been alive for almost 11,000 days
but I couldn't tell you something about

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:54.780
each one of them. I mean, not even close.

00:18:54.780 --> 00:19:00.730
Most of what we do and see and think and
say and hear and feel is forgotten

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:07.510
at a rate quite similar to Zipf's law,
which makes sense. If a number of factors

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:12.290
naturally selected for thinking and
talking about the world with tools in

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:17.250
a 'Zipf-ian' way, it makes sense we'd
remember it that way too. Some things

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:24.610
really well, most things hardly at all.
But it bums me out sometimes because it

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:29.840
means that so much is forgotten,
even things that at the time you thought you

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.500
could never forget. My locker number -

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:38.230
senior year - its combination, the jokes
I liked when I saw a comedian on stage,

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:45.150
the names of people I saw every day 10
years ago. So many memories are gone. When

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:48.870
I look at all the books I've read and
realize that I can't remember every

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:53.570
detail from them, it's a little
disappointing. I mean, why even bother if

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:58.030
the Pareto Principle dictates that my
'Zipf-ian' mind will consciously remember

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:04.280
pretty much only the titles and a few
basic reactions years later

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:09.260
Ralph Waldo Emerson makes me feel better.
He once said, "I cannot remember the books

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:15.720
I've read any more than the meals I have
eaten. Even so, they have made me."

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.049
And as always,

00:20:19.049 --> 00:20:20.209
thanks for watching.
