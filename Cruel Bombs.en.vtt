00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.130
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.379
Every cloud

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:05.679
has a silver lining.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.720
Except nuclear mushroom clouds,
which have a lining of Strontium-90,

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.589
Caesium-137 and other radioactive isotopes.

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.150
Upon detonation, atoms are literally gutted

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.840
and glutton at temperatures exceeding
that of the surface

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.869
of our Sun.
In the 1950s, Harold Edgerton's

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.250
rapatronic camera caught nuclear fireballs less than a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.200
thousandth of a second after detonation.
Using a special magnetic shutter,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.190
each exposure lasted only a billionth
of a second and captured

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.860
an other-worldly creature,
its energy vaporising the metal wires

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.440
supporting its tower into stringing legs

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.660
of plasma. Watch the target

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.949
on the ground.
Now, roughly visualized, here is a conventional

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.510
TNT explosion. Now, on the same spot,

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.100
a similarly sized bomb that uses nuclear

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.300
fission.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.540
When 'Little Boy' was detonated over

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.830
Hiroshima only 1.38% of its uranium

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.440
actually fissioned.
The rest was blown away before

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.320
that could happen, which means, as
Eric Schlosser points out, the

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.380
fission of merely 0.7 grams

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.300
of uranium, that's less than the weight of
a banknote, was enough to kill

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.240
80,000 people and destroy two-thirds

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.800
of city's buildings. When a country has
tens of thousands of nuclear weapons

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.640
ready to go,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.050
accidents are a possibility.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.800
This was a problem during the Cold War and it still

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.030
is a problem. What if there is a fire
or a miscommunication or a rogue

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.310
officer decides to

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.380
set one off. Or what if someone just drops

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.610
a warhead? How much risk

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.920
is too much, I asked Schlosser.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.380
The acceptable probability of a nuclear weapon

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.280
accident? What is it now?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.799
The acceptable probability

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.940
of the detonation of a nuclear weapon
in an accident is one in a million.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.459
In 2012, the odds of your dying

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.230
in a commercial airliner accident
were about one in forty

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.950
million. So that's even more remote than
the accidental detonation of a nuclear weapon.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.150
There have been 'oopsie daisy' moments
with nuclear weapons

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.480
on US soil. Luckily, none that
resulted in critical mass

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.070
but accidents nonetheless.
Just like when you

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.650
pee your pants, except your pants
are the entire planet

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.170
and the "P" stands for Plutonium.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.820
Eureka comes from ancient

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.410
Greek, meaning "I have found it!" And in

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.489
Eureka, North Carolina you can find

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.750
it. A giant sign that says

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.410
"Nuclear mishap". On my birth date

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.010
the year my father was born,
a US B-52 bomber carrying

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.560
two 4 megaton thermonuclear bombs

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.670
over North Carolina tumbled

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.709
from the sky. A loose lanyard in the
cockpit snagged the bomb release

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.410
switch.
Each bomb contained a greater explosive yield

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.790
than all munitions ever detonated by mankind

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.290
combined.
Lieutenant Jack ReVell discovered that only

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.739
one safety mechanism didn't fail that day.

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.250
A single low voltage arming switch remained

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.260
untouched during the crash.
And that one switch is why,

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.310
he explained in 2011, we don't have

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.730
a bay where North Carolina is today.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.430
The bombs were recovered... mostly.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.230
The uranium-rich Secondary
of one of the bombs was

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.830
never found. To this day it remains buried

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.340
underground in North Carolina.
Here's something you can try

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.330
at home.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.730
Build a nuclear reactor.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.460
In 1994, a 17-year-old David Han attempted to build

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.700
a nuclear reactor in his mother's backyard

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.120
in Michigan. It wasn't that difficult. For instance,

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.080
common everyday smoke detectors
contain small amounts of

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.000
radioactive Americium.
And old glow in the dark paint

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.140
contains Radium. His reactor never
reached critical mass but it did succeed

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.010
in exposing his neighborhood

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.500
to 1000 times the regular dosage

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.760
of background radiation. It was declared a
Superfund hazardous materials cleanup

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.280
site

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.990
and all of his work was confiscated by
authorities and buried

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.120
in Utah. It didn't end

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.920
there. In 2007 David Hahn was

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.230
arrested for stealing smoke detectors
from an apartment building.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:19.010
His face was covered with sores believed
to be caused by constant exposure to

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.810
radioactive materials.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.080
Three days after Little Boy was dropped
on Hiroshima by the Enola Gay

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.640
Charles Sweeney was ordered to drop Fatman

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.390
on Kokura. He flew boxcar over the city for nearly an

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.910
hour with the bomb bay doors open,
but it was cloudy.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.740
Sweeney couldn't achieve visual
confirmation of the target and was

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.540
forced

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.760
to go to the secondary target - Nagasaki,

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.970
where 75,000 people died instead.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.230
Kokura was spared because of the clouds.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.350
We can build a weapon

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:01.150
that mimics the furnace of our Sun
and the winds of Neptune but yet we can't

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.710
predict the weather more than
a few minutes ahead of time.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.360
During World War 2
Japanese soldiers spot for their

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.490
emperor in ways that made allied troops speechless.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.680
Kamikaze planes and torpedoes,
driven by a single pilot,

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.310
lost after use. When outnumbered,

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.440
without hope, Japanese soldiers were
reported to have thrown themselves

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.520
off clips or swam out to sea to drown

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.759
rather than surrendered. Even after two

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:36.930
atomic bomb attacks,
the Japanese Minister of War

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.050
urged his people to continue fighting.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.560
But on August 14th, 1945, the Emperor of Japan

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.960
overruled that decision and unconditionally

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.870
surrendered. Men had leapt of off cliffs

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.479
for him, but in his own words, 
the enemy has for the first time

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:59.509
used cruel bombs.

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:02.780
The heavy casualties are beyond measure.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.099
Richard Feynman received
the Nobel Prize in Physics

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:11.970
in 1965. He also helped develop
the first atomic bomb

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.070
at Los Alamos.
In "The Meaning of It All," he wrote

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.139
"Is science of any value?"

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:23.400
And below that,
"I think a power to do something

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.979
is of value." He elaborates by talking

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:32.150
about keys. Everything we learned about
the universe, everything we invent or

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.560
discover within it,

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.449
is a key to the gates of heaven.

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:40.750
But the same key will

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.009
also open the gates to hell.

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:47.060
The Titan II Missile is great for delivering

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.740
lethal nuclear warheads.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.970
But it also sent Gemini astronauts to space,

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:56.229
preparing us for a mission to the Moon.

00:07:56.229 --> 00:07:59.530
Science doesn't tell us how to use

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.889
keys. It finds them or predicts them.

00:08:02.889 --> 00:08:07.730
How we use keys is up to us.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:08.920
And as always,

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.860
thanks for watching.
