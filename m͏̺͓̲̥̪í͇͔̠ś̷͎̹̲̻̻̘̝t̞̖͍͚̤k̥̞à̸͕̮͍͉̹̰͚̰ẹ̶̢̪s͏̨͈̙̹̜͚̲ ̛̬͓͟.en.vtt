Hey, Vsauce.

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.719
Michael here. The title of this video is misspelled

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.820
in honour of mistakes. Mistakes are

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.620
everywhere, they surround us like air

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.279
To err is human. Faults, flaws, faux pas, fumbles

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.340
and fallacies are as much a part of who we are today

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.550
as the stuff we've gotten right. For instance,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.570
if a knight knocked your knuckle or knifed your knee,

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.030
why would there be so many "k"s?

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.019
Well, the "k"s are silent by mistake.

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.879
The original old English forms of these
words were pronounced with "k"

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:46.420
sounds.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.540
K-nife, k-night, k-nee.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.600
But that's a bit of a mouthful to say and
because reading and writing weren't as

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:55.429
common hundreds of years ago,

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:00.730
people just pronounced words the way
they want to do, regardless of spelling.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.540
Spelling is fun. Warren G knows what
I'm talking about. In the fourth

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.670
verse of his "What's Next", he asks what's next.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.500
What's next, what's N-X-E-T

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.940
Spelling isn't the only thing

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.110
we get wrong. The history of science is a graveyard

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.930
of dead an abandoned ideas.
Fritz Machlup coined the phrase

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.280
"Half-life of knowledge". The amount of time
it takes for half of the knowledge

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.510
within a field

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.510
to be superseded by new, better ideas
or to simply be shown

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.810
untrue. Donald Hebb famously

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.880
estimated that the half-life of knowledge in psychology

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.760
is just five years.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.980
Humans are awesome, don't get me wrong,
but we tend to believe that what we currently

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.160
think we know about the universe

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.280
is reasonably correct, even though statistics

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.910
aren't on our side. Previous generations

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.370
incorrectly thought the exact same thing
about what they used to think was true.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.890
My favourite examples of the ubiquity
of mistakes are production

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.019
errors in popular songs. They're like

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.969
humbling Easter eggs, just waiting
to be found. For instance, 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:18.640
Buffalo Springfield's "For What It's Worth".

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.840
26 second in the "be" in the lyric

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.249
"beware" is clipped, as is the "p"

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:30.120
in "people" at 1:24 minute. Once you hear the mistake,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.920
it's tough to unhear it. In "Hey Jude"

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.209
Paul McCartney misses a cord. And if you
listen closely you can clearly hear him

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:39.889
say

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:44.150
"F***ing h*ll". Seriously, it's in the actual song.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.569
Go listen to it. In fact, there's an entire
website that chronicles

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.569
mistakes in Beatles' songs. Take a look at this

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.260
700-year-old prayer book. A monk

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.380
wrote it on fresh, clean paper.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.700
I'm kidding, of course. He scraped the ink
off an older manuscript, cut the pages and

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.019
rotated them before

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.469
writing all over them. A mistake? Well,

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:13.459
kind of. Recent multispectral images

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.670
of the prayer book have revealed that
the old manuscript he

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.519
erased was a previously unknown copy of a work

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.999
by Archimedes. It was called "The Method"

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:27.549
and laid out the heart of calculus thousands of years

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.650
before Newton and Leibniz. If that one monk

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.109
hadn't erased that one book, would we be

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.489
hundreds, thousands of years
mathematically and technologically more

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:39.590
advanced today

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.870
than we currently are? It's hard to say.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.299
All that is certain is that we would
continue to make ridiculous mistakes,

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:47.739
like

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:54.540
the Mars Climate Orbiter.
This 327.6 million dollar expedition

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.340
burned up in the red planet's atmosphere because

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.809
when calculating flight manoeuvres NASA
used the agreed-upon metric units

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:06.889
while Lockheed Martin used the imperial system.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.540
This is Neil Armstrong taking humankind's first steps

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.799
on the Moon. It's about the best footage

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.810
we have. The original tapes containing
the highest quality recording

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.129
of that moment have been lost. They were probably

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:27.759
recorded over by later test missions. Ten years ago

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.849
Sergio Martinez became lost in the woods while

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:34.610
hunting outside of San Diego.
Hoping to attract the attention of

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.020
rescuers, he lit a small fire.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.419
But that fire quickly got out of control
and became a giant Cedar Fire.

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.870
It destroyed 300,000 acres of land,

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.270
2,322 homes and killed

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.159
15 people.

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:57.060
The man carrying a wounded soldier in
this painting, based on a photograph

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.889
taken during World War I,

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.370
is Henry Tandey, an English recipient
of the Victoria Cross.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.219
Four years after the event in this image
Tandey caught a wounded

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:12.090
German soldier in his gun sights.
But rather than kill the man,

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.129
Tandey took pity on his wounded state
and spared his life.

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:20.249
The German he allowed to live was

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:24.699
this man. Later the man whose life he
spared wore his mustache

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.710
shorter but still had the same name,

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.639
Adolf Hitler. In 1918

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:37.270
did Henry Tandey miss a chance to kill
Hitler? Detailed researchers found that

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.169
the exact

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.169
days their units were in the same
location don't quite match up.

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:45.189
The story is apocryphal but what is known

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:48.520
is that Hitler owned a copy of the painting

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.009
of Tandey, and in 1938,

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:55.819
when meeting with Neville Chamberlain,
Hitler pointed to Tandey

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:59.909
and told Chamberlain: "That man came
so close to killing me

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:03.370
in 1918 that I thought I
should never see Germany

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.349
again." So, who's wrong?

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:11.370
Maybe Hitler confirmed the story

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.500
merely because he hoped to make up extra
evidence that providence had kept him

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.469
alive to pursue his goals.

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:20.469
Either way, someone

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:24.509
is mistaken. Missed opportunities

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:29.189
are a bummer.
Obsessing over them is not healthy but regret

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:33.810
is a powerful emotion. How do you deal

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.250
with regret, with guilt?

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.899
Can you? In the early morning hours on a
bench outside a hotel in Anaheim this

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:43.560
summer

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.099
Ze Frank told me something
I am going to paraphrase.

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:50.979
I love this metaphor. Stuff in your past

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:55.560
is like a carving on the bark of sapling. Over time,

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.399
the scar, the carving won't go away.

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:03.990
Because of the way trees grow it won't
go up or down much either, it'll just

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.599
stay right where it began. It might even get darker.

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:11.159
But it won't get bigger. You, however,

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:15.800
can. You can keep growing,
doing more things, more branches,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:21.779
being more things. The wound won't get
smaller but you can make it a smaller

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:22.560
part

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.589
of who you are. Maybe regrets

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:29.729
are like that. They stick around forever

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:34.039
like arborglyphs. Or maybe they make like a tree

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:36.219
and leaf.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:41.759
A red or purple leaf in the autumn.
As days get shorter

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:45.050
and chlorophyll production decreases, the yellow

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.459
and orange carotenoids, which are always in leaves,

00:07:48.459 --> 00:07:53.719
appear as the green fades.
But red and purple leaves

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:58.500
are the interesting ones.
As winter approaches it would seem to be a good

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.909
time for trees to conserve energy but some trees

00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:04.969
do the opposite. Instead of giving up, they spend

00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:08.050
extra energy producing anthocyanins

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.750
to turn their leaves red and purple hues.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.919
These colours protect their leaves from
sun damage before their nutrients can

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:16.319
all be

00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:21.279
used and may also be a defence
against insects looking for

00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:25.099
a parasitic home.
A way for the tree to tell the insects: "Yes,

00:08:25.099 --> 00:08:28.979
I am in part dying but not without a fight.

00:08:28.979 --> 00:08:32.279
I am still very much vital."

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:35.729
Drought and even turn a kit applied by man

00:08:35.729 --> 00:08:40.880
can bring about these colors prematurely.
When you look at beautiful

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.420
autumn colours, you are looking at stress.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.630
But the bigger the fight the trees
put up, the more energy

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.329
they put into their defences at the
very end, the more brilliant

00:08:51.329 --> 00:08:54.769
their colours will be. Winter

00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:58.110
will eventually come. But scientifically,

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.740
the brightest, deepest, most remarkable colours

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.510
come from not giving up too easily

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:06.970
or quickly.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.500
And as always,

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.000
thanks for watching.
