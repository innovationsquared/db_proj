00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.440
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.460
Why do humans wear clothing?

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.219
Sure, we need it for protection from the
elements and fashion,

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:11.689
to show our personalities,

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:15.249
but no other animal makes and wears clothing.

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:20.869
More importantly, why do we feel embarrassed
to be naked around other people?

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.440
The word "embarrassed" comes from 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.160
the Portuguese route,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.440
"embaraÃ§a", which means to entangle or entwine.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.580
And feeling embarrassed often
feels like being tied up or exposed.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.180
But how can a healthy

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.640
amount of embarrassment be a sign

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.370
that you are likeable,

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.550
forgivable

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.450
and trustworthy.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.780
This t-shirt and hoodie

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.029
come from the YouTube Space LA,

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:54.140
which opened in November of 2012.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.380
But clothing

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.860
has been around a lot longer than that,

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.580
for at least

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.179
the last 100,000 years.

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.250
Clothing protects us from the cold,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.560
from rain, from the Sun

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.790
and it can also be an ornament.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.090
A way of accentuating certain parts
of our bodies or showing off wealth,

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.039
status.

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.940
It can even help us build

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.580
our own identities. But today I'm
interested in another use of clothing,

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.250
modesty.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.430
Why are humans

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.120
afraid to be naked?

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.460
Why are we ashamed of nudity?

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.600
Especially because animals pretty much
walk around naked

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.960
all the time.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.360
Why aren't animals embarrassed to be naked?

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.410
Well...

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.280
Let's take a closer look at embarrassment.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.220
Embarrassment is a fascinating emotion and

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.670
an extremely social one.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.470
You don't ever really ever feel embarrassed
alone, when no one's watching you or

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.590
listening to you.
So,

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.490
embarrassment probably evolved because
it is such a good influence on social

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.670
cooperation.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.940
We feel embarrassed when we violate little

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.909
social rules of conduct and each of us
individually hoping to avoid that,

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:16.169
to avoid embarrassment, 
has helped all of us live together better.

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:19.169
Healthy brains experience embarrassment.

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:22.739
Neurodegeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.080
can lead to less

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.119
awareness of yourself.

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:29.139
So a healthy amount of occasional embarrassment

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.480
is a good thing.

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.629
It's a sign of a socially adept

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.879
and normally functioning brain.

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.049
A famous experiment involved participants

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.659
watching an actor

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:41.319
receive

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.739
praise for achieving a very very high score

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.109
on an exam.

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:47.250
In some cases

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.069
the actor was told to feign pride in the achievement.
And in others,

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.150
they acted

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.259
embarrassed to have attention put on themselves.

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.969
Later,

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:00.409
the actors and the participants played games together

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.359
and the participants were more pro-social,

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.239
friendly and cooperative

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.279
with actors who earlier expressed embarrassment.

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:13.919
It's suggested that the actor was to be
trusted, that they desired to

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.399
fit in and work together.

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:21.199
Now, the fact that embarrassment displays
our knowledge of others and our desire

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:22.589
to be liked

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:28.109
may explain why evoking embarrassment
in others, whether it be flirtation or

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.870
playful teasing, is so common

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.069
when we kind of like the other person.

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:40.069
Shame is a stronger emotion.
And shame, when it comes to

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.479
our private parts, the kind nearly every
society - western or not - shares to some

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:49.759
degree is related to the root of our question today,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.400
modesty.

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.429
Havelock Ellis' writing on the
evolution of modesty

00:03:55.429 --> 00:04:00.219
is a big antiquated when it comes to vocabulary,
but he discusses quite well

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:03.559
two possible reasons for our fear

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:04.760
of nakedness,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.569
both of which predate clothing and
are not unique to humans.

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:11.449
The first

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.059
is the vital phenomenon of

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:15.519
refusal.

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.229
Before mating, many animals play a game of

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:19.219
chase,

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:20.220
hard to get,

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.569
a game of acceptance and then flight,

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:24.610
forcing the pursuer to

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.340
keep up

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.690
and prove their determination before being chosen

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.500
as a desirable mate.
So,

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.449
when it comes to humans, we can think of clothing,

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.429
paradoxically, as both a means of

00:04:37.429 --> 00:04:39.690
drawing attention to one's body

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.430
and simultaneously

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.680
as a way to

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.439
cover the body

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:45.360
modestly,

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.229
making us less available to every
and any potential mate,

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:50.169
rendering

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.039
breeding more selective.

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:58.550
Ellis also mentions the fear of evoking disgust.
And it's easy to see why

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:05.349
individuals of a species, who avoid things
we consider disgusting, would survive better.

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:11.349
Fecal material, waste, rubbish, other
bodily secretions can spread disease.

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:12.389
For instance,

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.649
animals whose poop likely contains
dangerous parasites avoid grazing around

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:19.349
or hanging out around

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:20.729
their waste.

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.000
Habits like that lead to more sanitary conditions

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.360
and a species more likely

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.169
to survive. It's a satisfying piece of
evidence as to why clothing once

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.740
invented was so quickly used to cover

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.289
private areas.

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.629
In 2009, the BBC
investigated another influential factor - 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:43.729
raising children.

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.830
In species where the young are born
pretty much ready for life,

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.430
it makes more sense to spend your time making babies,

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.669
as opposed to sitting around raising them.
They don't need it.

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:01.569
Super precocial animals, like the megapode,
hatch with full flight feathers

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:05.710
and can fly on their own within hours of hatching.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.889
Human babies, on the other hand,
are pretty darn altricial. We are born

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:16.410
barely able to do much besides swallow
food put directly into our mouths.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:22.360
Newborns can't walk or talk or
cook meals for themselves or drive

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.599
themselves to work.

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.159
It's ridiculous.

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:29.639
Why are human babies born so unready for life?

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:34.129
Why is so much development time still
needed after human kids are born?

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:39.599
Well, one explanation is that it's
because we are so brilliant.

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:46.229
Brain size is correlated with the body size.
Bigger bodies require bigger brains.

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:51.990
The shrew has a smaller brain than a human,
but us humans have smaller brains

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:57.130
than wales.
Of course, a bigger brain is not indicative of

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.110
intelligence.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.640
For one thing, larger animals literally
just have more cells they need to worry

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:03.529
about

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:05.090
and control.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.550
What matters more when it comes to
intelligence is the proportion

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.650
of brain size to body size.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.960
Compared to the size of our bodies,

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.760
our brains are gigantic, they're outliers,

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.970
they're off the charts.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:25.280
It's crazy. And a consequence of this is
that in order to to have a brain, as big

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.289
as ours,

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:29.529
come out of a mother, as small as

00:07:29.529 --> 00:07:35.110
a human, we have to come out with brains
that aren't fully formed. Brains and heads

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.179
that aren't as big as they will eventually
grow to be. And this is why human

00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:44.119
babies require so much care and so much
time to develop before their brains are

00:07:44.119 --> 00:07:46.049
ready for them to go off

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:47.569
on their own.

00:07:47.569 --> 00:07:52.370
Under this theory, being naked and
mating all of the time

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:56.560
might be a little bit less of a
priority for humans.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.889
Humans and societies that privilege modesty

00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:04.089
would have more time
and resources to put toward raising children

00:08:04.089 --> 00:08:07.479
and avoiding extra mates,
instead of just conceiving

00:08:07.479 --> 00:08:08.620
more kids,

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:14.009
allowing kids to develop properly and 
reproduce themselves.

00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:17.069
Clothing serves this purpose quite well.

00:08:17.069 --> 00:08:21.669
It conceals the privates and allows
more time to be spent on other

00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:23.149
things.

00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:24.399
Clothes,

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:25.590
clothing

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:29.960
may, in a way, actually be a consequence of our unique

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.479
intelligence.

00:08:31.479 --> 00:08:33.699
So the next time you put on clothes,

00:08:33.699 --> 00:08:37.229
keep in mind that one of the reasons
you're not running out into the world

00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:38.190
butt-naked

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.440
is because you have

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.340
such a big brain.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.100
No matter how dumb

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.160
the clothing is that you're putting on,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.200
it's a reminder that we

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.000
are smart.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:52.370
And as always,

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.630
thanks for watching.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.680
Kevin, thank you for joining me.
Thanks for having me.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.580
I hear

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:09.500
that there is an insect wing that can
naturally shred bacteria.

00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:14.899
That's right. I talk all about that and other
mind-blowing things over on Vsauce2 in the

00:09:14.899 --> 00:09:15.890
new episode of

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:19.690
of Mind Blow. Alright, well, let's go over there
and watch it. In fact, you guys can come

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:22.260
with us too.
