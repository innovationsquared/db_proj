Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.919
I am at the White House, in America's capital,

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.550
Washington, D.C. America makes a lot of
feature films every year - 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.949
Hollywood. But they don't make the most
feature films every year. Nigeria makes more.

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.490
But the country that makes the most
films every single year is

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.500
India. Every two years, the country

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.240
of India fills up enough film with unique
feature films

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.560
that stretch all the way from this city,
Mumbai, to where I live,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.340
in London. That's double what Hollywood
produces in two years.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.879
That is a lot of movies, but is

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.379
real-life a movie? I've discussed the frame
rate of the human eye before but how

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.520
does the resolution

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.000
of the human eye compare to a camera or screen?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.489
VHS, LaserDisc, DVD,

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.750
Blu-ray, IMAX. Numbers like these are
pixel dimensions. When multiplied

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.800
they tell us the total number of picture
elements an image is made up of.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.030
A figure often used to describe digital
cameras. It might sound like

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.070
more is better, but to be sure numbers
like 1920 by 1080

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.330
are not resolutions per se.
More pixels is only part

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.630
of the equation. Resolution is about distinguishing

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.310
fine details and that depends on a lot of other factors.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.830
For instance, the amount of light, the
size of the sensors,

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.159
what the millions of pixels are actually
encoding and

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.600
how close the subject is. I mean, up close

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.740
Salvador Dali's painting of his wife
looking at the Mediterranean can be

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.579
resolved into boxes. But from a far,

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.189
well, it's Abraham Lincoln. For crying out
loud, on a small enough screen

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.100
from far enough away, low and high,
so-called resolutions on screens, aren't

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.439
even resolved differently

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.119
from one another by your eye.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.060
How different nearby pixels are from one
another also matters. This is called

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.530
spatial resolution.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.590
For instance, if I go out-of-focus

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.380
the number of pixels in the video frame
stays the same but you can't resolve as much

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.780
detail. Now, with all this in mind we can still

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.629
compare human vision to a digital image,
by asking a better question.

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.870
Assuming everything else is optimal, how
many pixels would you need to make an

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.650
image on a screen large enough to fill
your entire field of view

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.860
look like real life, without any
detectable

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.560
pixelation? Now we are getting somewhere.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.980
Kind of. The analogy is still crudy

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.550
because a camera snaps an entire frame
at once, whereas

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.900
our eyes move around. The brain amalgamates

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.340
their constant stream of information
into what we call vision -

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.060
sight. In fact, the image created by the
eyeball alone during a single glance

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.269
would hardly even be acceptable on a
broken TV screen. We think

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.330
our eyes create images like this picture
Guy took of me with a camera.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.580
But for one thing, unlike a camera,
you've got some stuff

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.050
in the way. For instance, you are always

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.790
looking at your own nose, and maybe even
glasses,

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.310
if you have them. Luckily, our brains
process those stimuli out because they

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.159
don't matter

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:19.310
and they don't change. But thinking those are
the only difference

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.930
is a pitfall, literally,

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.180
latinly. The fovea gets its name from the Latin for

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.379
'pitfall'. The fovea is the pit on your
retina that receives light from the

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:32.629
central two degrees

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.950
of your field of view, about the area
covered by both your thumbs

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.650
when held at arms length away. Optimal
colour vision and 20/20 acuity are

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.560
only possible within that little area.
When it comes to these limitations XKCD[.com]

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.340
has a brilliant illustration.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.400
It points out other problems, like blind spots - literal blank spaces

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.410
in our vision where the optic nerve meets
up with the retina

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.920
and no visual information is received. If you bought

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.959
a camera that did this, you would return it.

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.989
You can find your own blind spot by closing

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.819
your right eye, fixating your left eye
on a point in front of you,

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.870
extending your left thumb and then moving it

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.819
left-of-center slightly slowly carefully
until

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.549
it's not there anymore. Crazy(!)
But, of course,

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.509
we don't see the world horribly, like
this, because our eyes are constantly moving,

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.620
dragging foveal resolution wherever we need it.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.910
And our brains' complex visual system fills in details,

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.840
merges images from both eyes and makes a
lot of gueses. What we actually see

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.060
is a processed image.
Not computer-generated imagery, but,

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.880
well, meat-generated imagery.
The neon color spreading illusion

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.870
is a great way to demonstrate this
difference. There is no

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.210
blue circle in this picture. The white here

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.610
is the same as the white here. A camera

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.669
isn't fooled, a screen isn't fooled, only

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.870
you and the fleeting gumbo of
ingredients you call perception

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.080
is fooled. Our vision

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.050
is not analogous to a camera. But our
reformulated question can still be

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.250
answered because human anatomy allows us
to resolve, to differentiate certain

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.770
angular distances. Famously, Roger N .Clark

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.900
used a figure of 0.59 arcminutes
as the resolution of the human eye to calculate,

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.010
based on the size of our total field of
view,

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.180
how many of these distinct elements
could fit inside of it.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.640
The result was an approximation of
exactly what we want to know:

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.909
how many individual picture elements -
pixels - our vision can appreciate.

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:47.980
His answer? 576 megapixels.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.820
That many pixels, packed
inside a screen large enough to fill

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.010
your entire field of view, regardless of proximity,

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.240
would be close enough to be undetectable
by the average

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.130
human eye. But we should factor in the fovea,

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.130
because Clark's calculation assumes
optimal acuity everywhere, it allows the

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.479
eye to move around.

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:13.479
But a single glance is more analogous to
a camera snap, and, as it turns out,

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:17.479
only about 7 megapixels,
packed into the two degrees of

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:20.630
optimal acuity the fovea covers during a fixed stare,

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.200
are needed to be rendered undetectable.
It's been roughly estimated that the

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.479
rest of your field of view would only need about

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:32.719
1 megapixel more information. Now that might
sound low but keep in mind that there

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:36.289
are plenty of modern technologies that
already use pixel densities

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:41.210
better than we can differentiate.
As Bad Astronomer deftly showed,

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.270
Apple's Retina Displays truly do
contain pixels at a density

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.469
average eyesight can't differentiate from typical

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:53.010
reading distances. But the fact that
there are screen sizes and pixel

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.870
densities that can fool the human eye

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.000
is not a sign that we see in

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.820
any kind of megapixelly way. Human vision just

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:07.349
isn't that digital. I mean, sure, like a
camera sensor we only have a finite

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:10.440
and discrete number of cells in our retina.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.669
But the brain adjusts our initial
sensations into a final perception

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:18.159
that is a wishy-washy top-down processed blob

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:21.580
of experience. It's not made of pixels

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.380
and furthermore, unlike a camera, it's not
saved in memory with veracity like a

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.820
digital camera file.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:32.599
Absolutely no evidence has ever been
found for the existence of a truly

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:37.229
photographic memory. And what's even
cooler is that not only do we not

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:40.229
visually resolve the real world, like a movie camera,

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:45.599
we also don't narratively resolve
conflict and drama in our lives

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:50.009
like most movie scripts. The point of
all of this, what I'm getting at,

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:53.699
is an idea. An idea that initially drew me to this question.

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:56.729
We play roles in the movie of life,

00:07:56.729 --> 00:08:01.789
but it's a special kind of movie.
Cinematic victories and struggles are often

00:08:01.789 --> 00:08:07.020
discrete, resolved, like pixels, with
unbelievably perfect beginnings and endings,

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:11.780
whereas the real world is all about ear resolution.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:15.300
I like how Jack Angstreich put it in 'Cinemania'.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.699
In a movie, a character can make a
decision and then walk away from the camera

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:25.659
across the street and have the credits
roll, freezing life in a perfect happily ever after.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.720
But in the real world, after you cross
the street,

00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:35.699
you have to go home. The world goes on.

00:08:35.699 --> 00:08:39.919
Life doesn't appear in any particular pixel resolution

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:43.089
or narrative resolution. Things are

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:47.819
continuous. The world was running before
you came around and it will continue running

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:52.339
after you are gone. Your life is a plot
only in so far as it begins

00:08:52.339 --> 00:08:55.690
and ends and occurs in medias res.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:58.740
Damerish opens illustration for
Charles McGrath's endings

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:03.140
without endings says it perfectly. In life, there rarely is

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.440
the end. There is only

00:09:05.449 --> 00:09:06.949
the and.

00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:08.129
And as always,

00:09:08.129 --> 00:09:09.489
thanks for watching.
