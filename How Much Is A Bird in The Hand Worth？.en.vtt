Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And as they say, "a bird in the hand

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.200
is worth two in the bush."
What it means

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.009
is that it's better to have a certain advantage

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.230
than to have nothing, except the possibility

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.260
of a greater one.
But two birds in the bush?

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.790
Who calculated that?
What really is the value

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.980
of a bird in the hand?
Well, according to Julian Baggini,

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.240
a bird in the hand is technically worth

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.320
2.48 birds in the bush.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.360
He calculated that number by looking at

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.179
observations from studies of what psychologists call

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:46.199
loss aversion. Loss aversion is a name
given to the tendency we humans have

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.429
to more strongly prefer to avoid losing
something we have

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:54.890
than to gain something that we don't. 
In general, it's been shown that if someone

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:55.659
loses

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.079
a hundred dollars, they lose more satisfaction

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.510
than someone who receives a hundred dollars acquires.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.540
Researchers have been able to get more
granular with loss aversion.

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.420
In one study, they gave half of the
participants something nice, like a fancy

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.149
mug,

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:14.180
and the other half they gave nothing.
Then

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.880
they asked the people
with mugs to come up with a value

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.530
for the mug were they to sell it and
never have it again.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.180
They also asked the people who never got
a mug how much they would be willing to

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.619
pay

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.039
to have a mug.
Now, the people who would never had one,

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.279
estimated that the value of the muh
would only be about $2.87

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.259
But those who did have the mug and knew that
they would never have it again if they

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:38.920
sold it

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.829
estimated its value to be about
two-and-a-half times larger,

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.369
around 7 dollars.
So, according to the evidence, in a general sense

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.500
having is actually slightly more than twice as good

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.229
as not having.
But why just cover that aphorism?

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.299
Let's talk about some other literary
terms, because our language can do some

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:00.369
pretty funny things

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.060
and those things it does have specific
names. Let's begin

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.289
with the blind date murderer.
A meme

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.509
people create that starts off all scary
and frightening,

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.989
but then turns out to actually be nice
and cuddling. For instance,

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.340
I'm going to rip off your face...book
status, you are so funny!

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.290
I'm gonna cut you... out some coupons for
that pizza place you like.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.780
If you struggle, it'll only make it worse...
according to this fascinating article

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.290
I'm sending you about quicksand.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.360
Many other memes use a similar structure
and the reason it's funny

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.790
is that it's an example of what is known
as paraprosdokian.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.470
A paraprosdokian is a sentence or
phrase you can use

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.930
that begins one way,
leading people to think a certain thing,

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.670
but then, in the second half, completely
reverses or in some way changes

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.430
that initial opinion.
I will eat your baby...

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.390
carrots if you don't want them.
Syntactic ambiguity

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.680
is when you can't figure out exactly
what a sentence means,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.019
because the order of the words doesn't
help. It frequently occurs in newspaper

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.129
headlines.
For instance,

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.700
"Police Help Dog Bite Victim."
Well, did the police help a person

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.590
who'd been bit by a dog or did the
police help a dog

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.760
bite a victim?
"Free Hat!" Are you giving away hats for free

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.019
or are you trying to get a guy named Hat out of jail?

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.120
Lexical ambiguity, in my opinion,
is often more fun.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.099
This happens when a word has multiple
meanings and figuring out which one is

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.610
being used in a sentence

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.579
is a challenge. The word "buffalo" can mean
a number of different things.

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.579
It's the name of an animal, the name of a
city and it can also be a verb,

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.950
which means to bully or confuse or baffle,

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.409
as in "Hm, this video buffalos me."
I tweeted about this a few months ago.

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.500
Because "buffalo" has those three meanings,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.930
it is possible to make it completely sensical

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.969
and correct, legitimate sentence using

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:02.530
only the word "buffalo."
Buffalo buffalo

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.610
Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo."

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.819
You have to think about it for a long time
for it to make sense,

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.129
but what it's really saying is that bison
from the City of Buffalo,

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.690
that bison from the City of Buffalo bully

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.150
also happened to bully other bison from
the City of Buffalo.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.350
Tongue twisters.
All I have to say here is that the "she"

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.229
inside "she sells seashells by the
seashore" is an actual

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.720
"she," not just some random girl.
"She" most likely refers to Marry

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.860
Anning, a British paleontologist who
collected fossils from beaches nearby

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.530
where she lived her entire life

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.759
and discovered the very first Ichthyosaur's skeleton

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:49.020
when she was only 12 years old.
Now it's time for my favorite literary term,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.750
tmesis. This word is great because you
get to spell it with the "T"

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.520
and then an "M," and no vowel in between.
Tmesis is a figure of speech

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.669
when you stick a word inside another
word. For instance,

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.389
why say "absolutely,"
when you could say "abso-freakin-lutely?"

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.900
And why say"you're welcome,"
when you could say "you're wel-diddly-elcome?"

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.220
And of course, "legend... wait for it...

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.770
dary."
Finally, a spoonerism

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.810
is a specific type of verbal mistake

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.690
where you switch the first two letters
of two words.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.180
Many of us do this occasionally, but it's
named after William Archibald Spooner,

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.850
a reverend who did this a lot.
For instance,

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.280
instead of saying that the Lord is a
loving Shepherd, he would tell everybody

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.430
that the Lord

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.009
is a shoving leopard.
He would get his "merds wixed up."

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.500
One of my favorite, however,
comes from Sarah Palin.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.560
When you spoonarise her name,
she becomes Parah Salin.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.960
And as always,

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.360
wanks for thatching.
