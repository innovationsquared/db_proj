00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.553
Hey, Vsauce Michael here, and today, we're
going to talk about this.

00:00:05.553 --> 00:00:09.545
What's happening right now—
the English language.

00:00:09.545 --> 00:00:14.107
A language spoken by more than a billion
people with many, many different accents.

00:00:14.107 --> 00:00:17.561
And according to last year's Harvard Google study,

00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:20.192
a language with more than a million words

00:00:20.192 --> 00:00:25.200
growing at a rate of 8500 new words
every single year.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.274
But we're getting ahead of ourselves.
Where did English begin?

00:00:29.274 --> 00:00:33.703
Well, for that answer, we're going to have to go
all the way back to the year 400,

00:00:33.703 --> 00:00:37.167
and even earlier to this little Germanic peninsula

00:00:37.167 --> 00:00:42.216
jutting off at an angle inhabited by people who
appropriately were called Angles.

00:00:42.216 --> 00:00:46.513
Now, these Angles began immigrating to
an island named Britain.

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:48.626
In fact, there were so many Angles there,

00:00:48.626 --> 00:00:51.551
you may as well have called it Angle Land.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:54.934
Angle Land, England.

00:00:54.934 --> 00:00:57.108
Before they had Latin characters,

00:00:57.108 --> 00:01:01.522
they wrote their language not in letters,
but in what are known as roons.

00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:05.403
And everything was fine and dandy until 1066

00:01:05.403 --> 00:01:09.111
when the Normans invaded and won.

00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:11.955
One of the neatest changes that still affects us today

00:01:11.955 --> 00:01:14.871
is the fact that this new Norman ruling class

00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:19.417
would refer to the meat they were served using their own words like beef or pork.

00:01:19.417 --> 00:01:22.962
But the poor old Anglo Saxons who
had to tend to the animals

00:01:22.962 --> 00:01:28.629
still used their early old English words, for instance,
cow and pig.

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:32.845
And to this day, that is why English is one of the very few languages on Earth

00:01:32.845 --> 00:01:37.356
that has a different name for the meat
of an animal than the name of the animal it came from.

00:01:37.356 --> 00:01:39.855
English did this a lot,

00:01:39.855 --> 00:01:42.395
borrow words from other languages and other people

00:01:42.395 --> 00:01:45.361
and just plop it right down into the English vocabulary.

00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:47.901
So see, English is really fun,

00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:51.487
or should I say fun is really English?

00:01:51.487 --> 00:01:54.290
That's right, unlike all of these borrowed words,

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.039
the word fun can be traced all the way back to the Angles

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.375
and the protogermanic word phono,

00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:03.494
which referred to a piece of cloth or  rag.

00:02:03.494 --> 00:02:08.838
It eventually came to mean a piece of fabric,
say a hoisted flag that flew in the breeze.

00:02:08.838 --> 00:02:12.007
And then it just came to mean anything
that was high flying

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:14.344
or buoyant, you know, like fun stuff.

00:02:14.344 --> 00:02:17.808
Singling out which words in English were borrowed

00:02:17.808 --> 00:02:19.982
and which ones were originally Germanic

00:02:19.982 --> 00:02:22.897
could be a pretty fun exercise, for instance, supervise

00:02:22.897 --> 00:02:28.028
is derived from Latin, but oversee,
that's straight up Germanic.

00:02:28.028 --> 00:02:32.741
Well, what would English sound like
if we just got rid of all these words

00:02:32.741 --> 00:02:34.986
that didn't originally come from the Angles?

00:02:34.986 --> 00:02:39.202
Well, what you would have is what is known
as Anglish.

00:02:39.202 --> 00:02:42.626
Anglish is really fun to read, because it's
not really a real language,

00:02:42.626 --> 00:02:44.627
it's just an exercise that we can do nowadays.

00:02:44.627 --> 00:02:49.462
My favorite is this passage explaining atomic theory.

00:02:49.462 --> 00:02:51.758
Of course, you can't call it atomic theory

00:02:51.758 --> 00:02:54.217
because, for instance, the word atom is Greek

00:02:54.217 --> 00:02:58.138
meaning something that cannot be divided
any further, so instead of using the word atom,

00:02:58.138 --> 00:03:01.440
writers will use words like uncleft.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.228
And instead of using a word like theory,

00:03:03.228 --> 00:03:05.310
they'll use a word like beholding.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.276
There's a link in the description to read all
of uncleft beholding.

00:03:08.276 --> 00:03:10.491
But now let's talk about accents.

00:03:10.491 --> 00:03:12.492
We don't all speak English the same way,

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:18.455
and as a confession, I'm going to say
I'm terrible at impressions—accents, dialects—

00:03:18.455 --> 00:03:20.538
I pretty much only ever talk like this.

00:03:20.538 --> 00:03:23.667
Luckily, I read the science, and young children

00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:26.003
are the best at picking up new accents.

00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:27.913
So I brought along my friend Todd.

00:03:29.457 --> 00:03:32.088
Nicely done!
-Thank you!
-Classic Vsauce move.

00:03:32.088 --> 00:03:37.302
Now, Todd is from ???, and he is fantastic at accents.

00:03:37.302 --> 00:03:39.719
Gratzi, Michael, gratzi.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:43.102
I'm impressed every day. But here's a
challenge for you, are you ready?

00:03:43.102 --> 00:03:47.735
Challenge.
-I want you to do an impression of exactly how you think

00:03:47.735 --> 00:03:51.199
George Washington spoke.

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:53.698
Let me just picture him, I've seen him on a quarter before.

00:03:53.698 --> 00:03:56.278
I think he probably sounded like this.

00:03:56.278 --> 00:03:59.122
Wassup, players? So, y'all gonna vote for me?

00:03:59.122 --> 00:04:01.499
I ain't gonna take two terms, just give me one - one shot,

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:04.252
uh, one and done, baby, you know what I'm saying?

00:04:04.252 --> 00:04:07.788
Naw, seriously, father, I did not
chop down that cherry tree.

00:04:07.788 --> 00:04:11.262
I like that, but you know what?
There's no way to be wrong.

00:04:11.262 --> 00:04:15.670
Well, I mean, there are ways to be wrong,
but we don't know the real answer,

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.683
because back at the time that America
first became a country,

00:04:18.683 --> 00:04:22.350
the classic British accent
didn't even exist yet.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.590
I quite like the Queen's English, yes.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.561
Yeah, that would be completely foreign to them.

00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:30.189
But here's what's really mind blowing about what the British gave to America—

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:33.115
southern drawl.

00:04:33.115 --> 00:04:35.197
That's right, these people known as the cavaliers

00:04:35.197 --> 00:04:39.159
came over to America before it was
an actual independent country,

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:41.790
and they brought things like the word y'all,

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.832
snickerdoodle, varmit,

00:04:43.832 --> 00:04:47.083
and they brought the word axed instead of ask,

00:04:47.083 --> 00:04:49.297
and the word ain't.

00:04:49.297 --> 00:04:52.762
As well as emphasizing the first syllable of words

00:04:52.762 --> 00:04:56.176
like guitar, July, and police.

00:04:56.176 --> 00:05:00.179
Man, I've taken a lot of heat from English people from being from Texas and all that,

00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:02.140
and they started it, didn't they?

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.721
But listen to this, the bo language

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.647
was a language spoken on an island off the coast of India,

00:05:07.647 --> 00:05:11.649
and then last year, this woman died.

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:14.605
She was the final speaker of the language.

00:05:22.956 --> 00:05:26.785
All I can think about is that lady trying to connect to people like oh, let us share in the cultural joke,

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:29.335
you know, the famous cultural joke of the Bo people.

00:05:29.335 --> 00:05:33.215
Yes, yes, it was probably quite lonely, Todd.

00:05:33.215 --> 00:05:36.426
Modern English as we know it didn't really begin that long ago.

00:05:36.426 --> 00:05:38.965
Think of it this way, there's a time capsule buried

00:05:38.965 --> 00:05:41.556
here in New York that is not going to be opened

00:05:41.556 --> 00:05:45.264
until the year 6939.

00:05:45.264 --> 00:05:48.149
By then, English itself may be completely different

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:52.151
or possibly extinct, and so they actually included a drawing

00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:56.113
of the human mouth where they diagrammed out where you need to put your tongue

00:05:56.113 --> 00:05:58.531
to say the letters like we say them today.

00:05:58.531 --> 00:06:01.701
And we only have to wait almost 5,000 years?

00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:04.494
What a bargain, how convenient for everyone!

00:06:04.494 --> 00:06:06.495
Yeah, what are we gonna do in the meantime?

00:06:06.495 --> 00:06:09.208
Well, you could head over to my
channel for some comedy stuff.

00:06:09.208 --> 00:06:13.088
We did an episode of Vsauce called Vsauce Unplugged.

00:06:13.088 --> 00:06:15.963
There's a lot of meat information over there about the brain and language,

00:06:15.963 --> 00:06:19.844
some joking around, and I got to talk to Dale.

00:06:19.844 --> 00:06:22.465
Dale the mouse.

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:27.270
He does not play around.
-No. Be sure to check out the cheese shorts over on Todd's channel.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.226
It's much more funny than Vsauce, but when you're there,

00:06:30.226 --> 00:06:34.350
and every time I'm there I'm just impressed by the characters and the accents and the language.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.697
We've got all sorts of stuff, we've got behind the scenes awesome stuff,

00:06:36.697 --> 00:06:39.816
we got stand up, we've got me going to China,

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:45.037
we've got all sorts of comedy stuff. Come over for a visit, I'll give you a bowl of soup, come on.

00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:48.451
Yeah, come on, I'll see you there,
and as always, thanks for watching.
