00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.590
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. If you threw

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.790
every single human alive today into
the Grand Canyon,

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.519
we would not fill it up.

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.290
We could make a pile about this big

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.619
That's it. That's all of us. All 7.159 billion of us

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.029
in one place. A species

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.090
portrait. It kinda puts humanity into perspective

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.309
and you. So does this. Everyday you
produce about one to two litres

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.510
of spit, which means, in your entire
lifetime

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.670
altogether, you will not produce enough spit

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.210
to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.140
So far, 560 billion Lego parts

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.460
have been manufactured and the total
number of grains

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.719
of sand on Earth is estimated to be 7.5 times 10

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.120
to the 18th. But here's the thing:

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.500
how many things are there... total?

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.300
Well, how do you define a thing?
Well, let's say it's a thing

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.229
if you can think about it or talk about it.
If you can call it a thing,

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.270
it's a thing.
This is going to be a lot of things.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.360
Things can be real, imaginary,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.580
impossible, ideas are things, things can
be looked forward to and things can be in the past

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.600
or yellow or concrete or abstract things can

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.740
happen and some thing's probably won't.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.189
Making a video about how many things there are.

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.329
That's a thing... that I'm doing right now.

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.329
Let's count everything.

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.899
Right away, the answer seems obvious. The word

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.509
'thing' is so vague, the answer is clearly infinite...

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.619
possibly... not.

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.519
All we have to do is take the maximum
number of physical things,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.580
things out there in the real
world, beyond our minds we could

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.350
in theory measure and add to that the
total number of things we

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.370
could imagine. The total number of thoughts possible.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.230
For the purposes of this video let's
assume that numbers and math

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.390
and the laws of physics exist as part of the way

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.500
our universe is. But the names and
representations they've been given

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.100
are the products of thinking minds and those things

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.540
are, well, things that we can count.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.760
And there's no reason to double count.
All of the indivisible

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.560
pieces that make up me, particles or strings or whatever

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.880
are the same as the thing that has been named me.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.180
Abraham Lincoln has a great quote about this.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.540
"How many legs does a sheep have if you call

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.860
its tail a leg?"

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.220
Four.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.640
Because calling a tail a leg doesn't make it one.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.410
Okay, let's begin. When counting the number of

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.040
physical things in the universe we hit an unknown.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.049
How big is the universe?

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.400
The entire universe could be infinite

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.739
or it could be finite, but edgeless for a
variety of reasons. There could also be

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.739
other universes. But it's unclear whether
we'll ever be able to actually see all these

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.489
things. Instead, what we are stuck with,
and what we usually mean when we say

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.450
'the universe', is the observable universe

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.959
whose future visibility limit has been
estimated to be only 62

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.239
billion light-years in any direction.

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:42.170
That's it. This is likely the only
inventoryable space we'll ever need

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.560
to worry about. And it contains roughly,

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.560
on average, ten to the eighty elementary
particles. Particles with no

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.970
further internal parts as far as we currently now.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.820
So that's our answer, right? There are ten to the eighty

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.820
physical things that exist out there,
beyond our own minds.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.230
Any other physical thing - water, dogs,
planets,

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.400
saxophones - are just names given to
particular arrangements of those same

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.709
ten to the eighty particles. But wait, what if,

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.049
in the future, we discover that what we
call elementary particles today

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.750
are actually just made out of smaller
things we should have counted

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.860
instead? Well, to cover ourselves let's count

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.380
the maximum possible number of the
smallest measurable thing.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.640
Something the size of a Planck volume.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.950
10 to the power of 183

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.870
things that small could fit within our observable universe.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.140
I like this number, 10 to the power of 183.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.520
You couldn't easily argue there 
were more things than that

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.840
in the physical, real-world.
But you could imagine.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.880
A Planck length, a Planck volume.
That's just

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.510
the smallest measurable amount of space,
not the smallest

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.270
possible. You could imagine a

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.659
half Planck volume, a 10,000th of a Planck volume.

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:09.260
But, that would just be a thought and only ever

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.780
a thought. So, how many possible thoughts

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.150
are there? It's probably safe to say that
the number of possible

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.440
thoughts is, indeed, infinite. For example,

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.760
numbers. You can't say there's a limit to
the biggest number we can imagine.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.490
But, unlike physical things that exist
whether or not we have

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.669
discovered them, do unthought thoughts

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:38.479
already exist? It seems more like
the pool of possible

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:43.510
thoughts is really just one thing an
actual elements from that set don't

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.180
become things by themselves until we thing them

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.500
that is we or some other mind thinks
about them

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.990
or talks about them and there's a limit to
how many things

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.169
we or anything else could ever thing

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:01.900
our observable universe is only so big
and it will contain usable energy

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.330
for only so long. After about 1 trillion
to a hundred trillion years

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.050
the supply of gas needed to form new
stars will be

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.550
exhausted and the lights will start
going out

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.620
one-star at a time. After a

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.599
Google years the amount of usable energy
left in the universe will be

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:27.189
0 and nothing will be able to happen

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:30.349
to calculate the maximum number up
thoughts that could be

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:33.849
thought inside our observable universe
let's take

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:37.319
all of its mass and turn it into human
brains

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:41.300
that just think new and random thoughts
from the beginning of time

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.990
until the universe runs out of usable
energy, a Google years

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.000
of thinking. But wait, what if there are

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.199
alien brains or for all we know Earthling
brains that

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:54.610
think faster than we can okay well to be
safe

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.870
let's not turn all of that mass into
human brains let's use it to build a

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.740
giant hypothetical machine that computes at
the fastest speed possible given the

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:04.469
speed of light

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:07.770
in the uncertainty principle; Bremermann's
Limit

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.729
its 1.36 times ten to the fifty bits
per second per kilogram

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:17.889
of material, now a high-end estimate for the
total mass of the observable universe

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:21.400
is 3.4 times ten to the the 60 kilograms

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.460
which used exclusively for the best
possible computing machine could altogether

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.289
process 4.624 times ten to the 110

00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:36.469
bits per second. Now with 3.154
times 10 to the 116

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:40.349
seconds available from the beginning of
time to the heat death of the universe

00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:44.039
and an assumption that the average
thought takes about a sentance worth

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:45.810
of information to describe

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.050
say about 800 bits we get a total

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.069
of 1.458 times

00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:55.610
ten to the 227 things that could

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.909
ever be thought or imagined. That number

00:07:59.909 --> 00:08:04.300
is huge. In the observable universe

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.440
the universe as we will ever
know it the number of thoughts that can be thought

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.339
is so much larger than the number of physical
things there can be with out

00:08:12.339 --> 00:08:16.360
imagination and if you were to combine the
two totals

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.419
the number of physical things would
barely

00:08:19.419 --> 00:08:23.069
make a difference. So, funny enough

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:26.370
when it comes to every thing in the universe

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:29.520
it really is the thought that counts.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.500
And as always,

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.280
thanks for watching.
