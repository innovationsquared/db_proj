Hi, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.530
You can practice speaking backwards, so when your words are reversed

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.900
their intelligible. But here's something
else that is weird.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.330
The digits in the speed of light are
exactly the same

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.480
as the latitude of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.220
And, as the anagram genius has revealed, all the world's

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.270
a stage but if you rearrange the letters
in the meaning of life

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.350
it becomes be engine of a film

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.580
or, more pessimistically, the fine game of nil.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.620
What does all of this mean?

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.400
Are these just coincidences?

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.000
Or are greater powers at work?

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.140
Why is it so easy for us to find

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.030
hidden messages? Why can a mere
coincidence give us chills

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.530
and why is it so fun?

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.480
When you reverse Neil Armstrong saying 'small step for man'

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.229
you can hear what sounds like man will
space walk

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.800
Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated
President John F Kennedy

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.439
and this interview he defends the Fair
Play for Cuba committee

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.099
of which he was a member. 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.820
Now listen to what it
sounds like when we reverse him saying

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.300
'and the Fair Play for Cuba'.

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.240
is that a coincidence or a subconscious
confession hidden within his own words?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.080
It's a coincidence.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.640
For crying out loud, if anybody says 'and
the Fair Play for Cuba',

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.000
and then reverses it, it sounds the same.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.340
This app, by the way, is called
Virtual Recorder.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.630
It's a really easy way to quickly reverse
your own speech.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.420
Matthew Hutson in 'The 7 Laws of Magical Thinking' points out that if you record

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.720
yourself saying

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.720
and then reverse it

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.810
it sounds a bit like happy birthday to
you

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.860
Kind of.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.860
If a word can be spelt the
same forward

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.340
and backward, it's a palindrome.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.890
But if a word or phrase

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.790
sounds the same, whether spoken forward
or rewound,

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.370
it is a phonetic palindrome.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.240
For example,

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.820
say yes. Reversed

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.830
Pretty cool. But  check out this poem by
Karsten Johansson

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.630
By the way, some people can speak in
reverse on the fly

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.590
It is really cool to see them in action.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.990
Watch Guy's lean back

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.930
after this video. It's linked down in the
description and it's full of pretty cool coincidence videos.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.600
Apophenia is the perception of
connections or patterns

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.110
in information.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.030
One type of Apophenia is Pareidolia -

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.120
the scene or hearing of things that
weren't meant to be there.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.450
For instance, hearing your name being
called or your phone ringing

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.230
in the sound of running water, or
hearing English words

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.700
in a non-English song or seeing faces

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.960
that weren't purposely placed there. Our
brains are good at this kind of work,

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.270
probably because being hyper
attentive to patterns and faces

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.509
can save your life. If there's ambiguity
as to whether that

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:23.449
thing hiding in the shadows is a threat, or just a shadow,

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.530
it's advantageous to air on the side

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.770
of threat. Organisms with a healthy sense of Apophenia

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.190
live longer, long enough to have kids and
raise them

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.830
and naturally become the norm. We connect
with

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.970
faces so well Hutson relates a story of
a friend who draws

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.130
faces on things she doesn't wanna lose,
like her bags.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.860
She says the faces make her less likely to
forget about them.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.530
If you like it, you should have put a
ring on it, if you like not losing it,

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.650
you should have drawn a face on it.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.450
We are so good at

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.820
teasing out patterns and faces from
random noise

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.180
actual random sequences don't always

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.020
feel random to us.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.060
Originally, Apple's iTunes shuffle feature generated
complaints from users.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.700
They said that similar songs, or songs
from the same artist,

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.060
appeared in a string, which, of course, is
to be expected

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.420
from randomness but it didn't feel
random enough.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.130
So Apple introduced a smart shuffle

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.910
that avoided totally random sequences
that nonetheless

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.780
didn't seem random to our pattern
loving brains.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.600
As Steve Jobs explained, "we're making it
less random

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.110
to make it feel more random".

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.320
Our impressive ability to imagine
patterns also expresses itself when it

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.850
comes to connecting songs

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.020
and moving images. This dancing
Spider-Man animation will

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.720
famously sync up with any music you play.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.530
Try it. What kind of black magic is going on
here?

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.480
Well, as it turns out, most of it is in
our heads.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.460
Radiolab reported that Michigan
State University explains that the major movements

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.980
of dancing animations like this one, or this one,

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.060
move at typical song tempos but also
contain, like most

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.720
dance, various other different related rhythms of movement allowing them to seemingly 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.410
fit many different tempos.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.380
Selection bias helps a lot too.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.980
We fall prey to this when we reject all the times the animation

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.630
doesn't really sync up, focusing instead
on the more surprising times

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.010
when it does.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.990
The bizarre pyramid coincidence mentioned earlier

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.990
is a lot less bizarre when you consider
the fact that we got to control where

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.820
we placed the decimal point,

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.750
and that a number of degrees this precise
isn't necessary to locate the pyramid.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.320
By the fourth decimal we're only talking
about a matter of a few meters,

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.410
so it's easy to make the rest fit the
speed of light exactly

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.520
and have still picked a point on the pyramid.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.690
Confirmation bias also comes into play here.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.910
If you really want two things to sync up,

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:07.970
they will.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.290
We often look for evidence that supports
what we already believe,

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.290
while marginalising things against it.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:19.110
As Marshall McLuhan said "I wouldn't
have seen it, if I hadn't believed it".

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.780
These biases also help explain
the seemingly mind-blowing coincidence that

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:27.320
famous movies and famous albums can line up.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.100
One the most popular states that if you
start playing Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.720
at the same time as The Wizard of Oz,
they will eerily

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.580
line up. Entire communities have sprouted
around the syncing

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.980
of movies and albums. Some of my
favorites are the Yellow Submarine soundtrack

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.560
and the Little Mermaid, Lorde's Pure Heroine and Twilight Saga - Breaking Dawn 2,

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.169
and the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:54.329
with Pink Floyd's Echoes.

00:07:54.329 --> 00:07:55.789
There are conspiracies

00:07:55.789 --> 00:08:00.099
that these were somehow secretly planned, though in reality

00:08:00.099 --> 00:08:05.380
they're just accidental music videos. The
product of selection bias,

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.500
confirmation bias and

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.280
the law of near enough.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.280
A behaviour of our pattern sensitive
minds.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.960
Two things don't have to line up exactly, or literally,

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.860
for us to see a connection. This is why
vague predictions

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:24.409
are a great way to look psychic. These
are also actually

00:08:24.409 --> 00:08:28.210
unsurprising when you consider the fact
that the number of narrative

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.820
paces and rhythms we enjoy, and
typically use,

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.120
are much smaller than the number possible.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.770
In 'The Improbability Principal', David J
Hand calls this

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.400
"the probability lever".

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.020
What may be rare

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.520
on average, or when considering all
possible scenarios,

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.790
can be less rare for specific scenarios,

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.709
even if they are only marginally
different. Getting struck by lightning

00:08:52.709 --> 00:08:56.959
is a proverbially unlikely event, but
Walter Summerford

00:08:56.959 --> 00:09:01.190
wasn't just struck by lightning once
during his life,

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.230
he was struck three times. It never

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.230
killed him but four years after his
death

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.860
his gravestone was also struck by
lightning.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:15.400
What are the chances? I mean, clearly
Summerford was some sort of

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.110
robot built out of lightning rods or had somehow angered Zeus,

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.300
right?

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:25.210
Probably not. You see, while for the
average person

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.870
the chance have been struck by lightning
is quite low, for an avid outdoor

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.290
sportsman like Summerford,

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.210
it's not as low.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.210
The law of truly large numbers

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:35.740
also comes into play here.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:40.620
With lightning striking Earth forty to
fifty times a second, billions of people

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.830
for it to strike and

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:45.990
thousand of years of recorded history, it's
actually not surprising at all

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.990
that at least once a story like Summerford's

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:50.550
would have happened.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.180
Given the truly large number of people

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:58.180
who visit Disney World every day, and the fact that they take photos and lots of them,

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.790
it's actually not surprising at all that
at least one so far,

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:06.080
a story like Alex and Donna Voutsinas' has happened.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.320
While sorting through old photos before
their wedding, Alex and Donna found a photo

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.170
of Donna

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:14.450
at Disney World, fourteen years before
the couple met.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:19.900
But then Alex noticed something. He too had visited Disney World as a child, and there,

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.720
in the background, was his father pushing
him in a stroller.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.150
Sometimes coincidences can be tragic.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:30.760
In 1864, Abraham Lincoln's son,

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.840
Robert Lincoln, was saved from
serious injury - or possibly even

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.910
death - when a stranger grabbed him by the shirt collar

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.260
moments before he plunged on the train
tracks below.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.270
That stranger turned out to be Edwin
Booth, one of the most famous

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:49.680
Shakespearean actors of the time. So famous in fact Robert recognized him

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:55.640
and had a letter sent thanking him
for saving his life. Less than a year later

00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:00.300
Edwin Booth's brother, John Wilkes Booth,
undid the favor by

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.180
assassinating Abraham Lincoln.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.160
Strange as they seem at first,

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:09.620
math says that given enough time and
psychology says that given enough interest

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.850
in finding them,

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:14.910
coincidences and connections will be found,

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.650
even unlikely ones. The coincidences between

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:22.040
Abraham Lincoln and John F Kennedy are famous.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.820
Both were elected to the presidency in
the year ending with sixty.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.120
Lincoln was shot at Ford's Theatre,

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.660
Kennedy was shot in a 1961 Lincoln
Continental four-door convertible,

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.670
made by Ford.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.110
Both presidents' last names have seven letters

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:42.490
and both assassins had 15 letters in
their names.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:45.700
The list goes on, as it should.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:50.200
If you look long enough, you can find
coincidences between any two people or

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.350
things or events.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:55.940
They may seem strange at first but tend to
wind up being in the end

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:59.350
pretty expected. For just one example,

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.840
name length isn't that wildly variable.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.270
Seven-letter names are pretty common.
Lincoln,

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:10.020
Kennedy. Michael. Stevens

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:14.720
In the famous spooky presidential
coincidences contest,

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:19.580
held by the Skeptical Inquirer in 1992,
one contestant alone

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.790
found similar lists of crazy
coincidences

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:26.800
between 21 pairs of former presidents.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.590
Given the vast amount of details in any one
of our lives,

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:36.030
it's pretty easy. This court can be
exploited to almost comedic heights

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.430
when it comes to over-analysing.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:43.380
Of course, hidden messages and signs are often intentionally included in media

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.570
for fun, or to reward attentive viewers.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.930
But unintentional, extraordinary things

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:54.910
happen all the time. It's not really that extraordinary.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.640
There's a famous calculation

00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:00.930
that is known as Littlewood's law. Given
the number of hours

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:06.000
we are awake every day, and
assuming an event only takes about a second to occur,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.100
if you calculate the odds of something happening to you are only one in a million.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:16.480
Well, you should expect that thing to
happen to you about once every 35 days.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:21.240
David J Hand took this even further with seven billion people on Earth

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.140
the chance that an event with a
one in a million probability of happening

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:29.380
to each of us won't happen today is
1

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:34.250
in 10 to 3040. As Persi Diaconis put it,

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:38.050
the truly unusual day would be a day
where

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.250
nothing unusual happens.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:41.760
And as always,

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.160
thanks for watching.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.180
You may have noticed a lot of YouTube
channels making videos about learning this week.

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:53.950
Well, that is not a coincidence. It is
school of YouTube week.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.340
Many people are going back
to school or college right now

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:02.180
but across the world millions of children won't be

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.500
either because they work to
support their families

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:08.120
or live without a home. Or in areas
where there is conflict.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.460
They may experience overcrowding at school or a lack of teaching

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:15.310
and school supplies. But luckily, we can help.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:18.710
Donations to Comic Relief's School of
YouTube campaign

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:22.140
can help disadvantaged young people all
around the world

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.390
get an education. It doesn't take much to
change a life.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:29.500
You can learn more in the description below or donate right now.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.100
And as always, thanks for helping and thanks for learning.
