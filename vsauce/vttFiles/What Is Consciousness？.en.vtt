00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:04.103
Hey Vsauce, Michael here,
and a hemispherectomy

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:07.823
is a surgical procedure
in which half of a person's brain

00:00:07.823 --> 00:00:09.983
is removed.

00:00:09.983 --> 00:00:13.053
It's usually only ever done
on very, very young patients

00:00:13.053 --> 00:00:15.723
because their brains are still plastic enough

00:00:15.723 --> 00:00:18.243
that the remaining half
will take on the functions

00:00:18.243 --> 00:00:19.953
of the half that was removed.

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:22.933
And it's usually done
because a young child or a baby

00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:26.113
is having seizures, and removing
the part where the seizures occur

00:00:26.113 --> 00:00:28.353
is the only solution.

00:00:28.353 --> 00:00:30.363
But here's my question.

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:32.543
If you can live with half a brain,

00:00:32.543 --> 00:00:35.173
what if I were to take two empty skulls

00:00:35.173 --> 00:00:37.223
and take one half of your brain

00:00:37.223 --> 00:00:39.493
and plop it into one body
and the other half

00:00:39.493 --> 00:00:41.583
and put it in another body,

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:44.703
which person would be you?

00:00:44.703 --> 00:00:48.933
I mean, you are you.
You are conscious.

00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:52.223
You are aware of what is happening to you

00:00:52.223 --> 00:00:55.723
from the perspective of yourself.
Think of it this way.

00:00:55.723 --> 00:00:59.083
If you just stare at something
and kind of feel

00:00:59.083 --> 00:01:02.283
what it feels like to be you,

00:01:02.283 --> 00:01:05.573
it feels a little bit like you're a thing

00:01:05.573 --> 00:01:09.443
inside a body looking out through the eyeballs.

00:01:09.443 --> 00:01:11.573
And nobody else on Earth

00:01:11.573 --> 00:01:14.843
will ever see the world from that position.

00:01:14.843 --> 00:01:17.863
This awareness of your own experiences,

00:01:17.863 --> 00:01:20.183
the awareness that you are having them,

00:01:20.183 --> 00:01:22.953
the awareness that you
are having your own thoughts

00:01:22.953 --> 00:01:25.823
makes up what we call consciousness.

00:01:25.823 --> 00:01:28.573
But if I were to take your brain
and split it into two

00:01:28.573 --> 00:01:30.703
and put it into two different people,

00:01:30.703 --> 00:01:32.713
would both of them be new people
who were conscious?

00:01:32.713 --> 00:01:36.313
Well, one of the best places to start

00:01:36.313 --> 00:01:38.463
when defining consciousness
and understanding it

00:01:38.463 --> 00:01:42.323
is to begin with things that we agree
are not conscious.

00:01:42.323 --> 00:01:44.873
For instance, Cleverbot.

00:01:44.873 --> 00:01:47.043
Cleverbot.com is an amazing website

00:01:47.043 --> 00:01:51.783
where a computer program will respond
to your questions really cleverly

00:01:51.783 --> 00:01:56.513
but only because it is programmed to do so.

00:01:56.513 --> 00:01:58.513
We wouldn't consider it conscious

00:01:58.513 --> 00:02:01.133
because it doesn't have a sense of itself.

00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:04.533
It doesn't feel anything.
It doesn't have its own inner life.

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:09.643
It's just a program that responds
automatically to my inputs.

00:02:09.643 --> 00:02:12.863
Now I know that I am not like Cleverbot.

00:02:12.863 --> 00:02:16.963
I know that I feel things
and that I have a sense of myself.

00:02:16.963 --> 00:02:19.153
I have intentions.

00:02:19.153 --> 00:02:22.143
But how do I know that you do?

00:02:22.143 --> 00:02:26.553
For that matter, how do I know
that everybody else that I meet is like me?

00:02:27.126 --> 00:02:30.283
How do I know that they're not
just little smart versions of Cleverbot

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:32.773
who know exactly what to automatically say?

00:02:32.773 --> 00:02:35.493
Now what I'm asking is incredibly philosophical,

00:02:35.493 --> 00:02:38.273
but it is a very famous and important question.

00:02:38.273 --> 00:02:42.383
I'm basically asking if it's possible
for something to exist

00:02:42.383 --> 00:02:46.053
as a philosophical zombie.

00:02:46.053 --> 00:02:51.092
That's right, a thing that reacts and responds
and acts just like a normal human

00:02:51.092 --> 00:02:54.772
but yet doesn't actually feel anything.

00:02:54.772 --> 00:02:58.102
It doesn't know that it's having its own thoughts.

00:02:58.102 --> 00:03:00.892
It just automatically responds like a robot
in the appropriate way.

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:04.052
Now what's amazing and heavy about this question

00:03:04.052 --> 00:03:07.352
is that science doesn't have an answer,

00:03:07.352 --> 00:03:10.982
and it's not even clear that science
will ever have an answer,

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:13.852
let alone an approach to finding that answer.

00:03:13.852 --> 00:03:19.602
About all we have is the psychology
of disorders of consciousness.

00:03:19.602 --> 00:03:22.012
Let's begin with anosognosia.

00:03:22.012 --> 00:03:25.322
A common example of anosognosia
in psychology classes

00:03:25.322 --> 00:03:29.512
is a patient who has, say, lost the ability
to move their left hand.

00:03:29.512 --> 00:03:31.532
When asked to raise their right hand,

00:03:31.532 --> 00:03:34.052
they'll say, "Yeah, no problem, here you go."

00:03:34.052 --> 00:03:36.822
But then when asked to raise their left hand,

00:03:36.822 --> 00:03:39.402
they'll say, "Oh, yeah, sure, no problem,"

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.382
but not move it.
And when asked why they didn't move their left hand,

00:03:45.382 --> 00:03:48.152
instead of reporting that they can't,

00:03:48.152 --> 00:03:50.392
they'll confabulate some excuse.

00:03:50.392 --> 00:03:52.392
For instance, "Oh, I didn't feel like it."

00:03:52.392 --> 00:03:55.832
Anton-Babinski Syndrome
is even more dramatic.

00:03:55.832 --> 00:03:59.722
Patients with this syndrome
are cortically blind.

00:03:59.722 --> 00:04:01.832
They cannot see anything.

00:04:01.832 --> 00:04:04.732
But they deny being blind.

00:04:04.732 --> 00:04:08.259
If you ask them a question, for instance,
"How many fingers am I holding up?"

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:11.009
they will make a guess,
but if they're wrong,

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:13.809
they'll explain their inaccuracy
with an excuse.

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:16.609
For instance, "oh, well, I don't have my glasses."

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.629
People who exhibit anosognosia

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:21.189
tend to be the victims of stroke,

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:24.839
and there's some disconnect
between what they're really experiencing

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:27.299
and their conscious awareness of it.

00:04:27.299 --> 00:04:29.949
They don't know that they can't see

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.709
because the part of their brain
that monitors visual input

00:04:32.709 --> 00:04:35.099
isn't telling the brain anything.

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.619
It's not even telling the brain
that there is no visual input

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:39.799
which means that the parts of their brain

00:04:39.799 --> 00:04:43.039
responsible for answering questions
or creating speech

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.039
has to completely create
a confabulated response.

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.169
Despite the fact that we've been able to study

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.279
patients with anosognosia,
we still have no idea

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:54.809
how to solve our original problem.

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:57.189
In fact, all we've managed
to come up with

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:00.749
are more impossible questions
about identity,

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:03.539
questions that are so befuddling,
the best you can do with them

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.609
is to answer them yourself
according to what you believe.

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:09.289
Here's another one.
It's called the Swampman.

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:11.689
Imagine that I'm walking
around in a swamp

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:14.759
and then all of a sudden,
I get struck by a bolt if lightening

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.459
and my entire body is burned to a crisp,
dissolved into smithereens.

00:05:18.997 --> 00:05:22.949
But the very same moment,
a second bolt of lightening strikes nearby,

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.299
and it causes a bunch of atoms and molecules

00:05:25.299 --> 00:05:29.239
to all arrange themselves
into the exact same configuration

00:05:29.239 --> 00:05:33.899
that my body used to have,
making a second Michael.

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:36.119
Is that me? Would that be me?

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:38.999
Here's an even better one.
Imagine that a surgeon came in,

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:43.459
and he started removing cells
from me and from you,

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:47.599
replacing them exactly one at a time,

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:51.179
replacing my cells into your body
and your cells into my body.

00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:55.999
At what point would I
officially have become you?

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:59.229
No one on Earth has the definitive answers
to these questions,

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:01.799
but you know what we do have?
A lean back.

00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:05.779
That's right. I've made a playlist
of some of my favorite clips from all over YouTube

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:07.839
of psychology experiments and illusions

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:10.899
and all sorts of fun stuff
that deal with consciousness.

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:13.489
All you have to do is click the link
at the top of this video's description

00:06:13.489 --> 00:06:17.889
and then lean back and let the automatic playlist
do the work for you.

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:20.959
I'll see you over there, and as always,
thanks for watching.

00:06:27.549 --> 00:06:29.779
Hey Kevin, any new YouTube messages?

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:33.069
Actually yes. I just got this message
over at Vsauce 2

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:35.189
from a user who doesn't create videos

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:38.079
but he organizes them in his own playlists.

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:41.669
Yeah, yeah, that's excellent
because there's so many videos on YouTube,

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:44.379
we need people to help organize them,
especially by type.

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:49.519
Imagine a channel of playlists ranging
from cool songs to listen to when it rains

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:52.089
or best explosions ever.

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:54.699
Exactly. If you make a playlist
that you think is really cool

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:57.499
and full of stuff that we should know about,
send it to Michael@Vsauce.com

00:06:57.499 --> 00:06:59.249
and we'll feature the ones we really like

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:02.399
because you have made YouTube
a better more organized place.

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:06.059
And after all, Vsauce is kind of like a carpool lane.

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:08.289
We're all going to get
to the cool stuff faster

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:10.829
because we're traveling together.

00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:14.429
Where did you get that?
