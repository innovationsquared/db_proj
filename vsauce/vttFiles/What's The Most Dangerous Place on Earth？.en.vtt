00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:10.700
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. 93% of all the
humans who have ever lived are dead. For every

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:19.010
person alive right now, there are 15 people
who are no longer alive. The Earth is dangerous...but

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:26.280
where is the most dangerous place on Earth?
Ignoring freak occurrances, where is the most

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.230
persistently perilous place on the surface of our planet?

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.969
Well, let's being with temperature. Extreme
heat and extreme cold can kill within hours,

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:45.429
if not minutes. In cold environments, without
clothing, the human body, by itself, doesn't

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:51.219
do a very good job of maintaining a high enough
temperature to live. It just takes too much

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:58.219
work. Even when you feel comfortable and warm,
nearly half of your daily caloric intake is

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.929
used merely to keep your body's temperature
where it should be.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:08.200
If you took a human and stripped them naked
and put them in an environment at 0 degrees

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:15.200
Celsius, they would die from having too cold
of an internal temperature within about 20

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:24.080
minutes. We need warmth. But one thing we
need more immediately than that is oxygen.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.140
And that brings us to the summit of Mount Everest.
This place on the surface of Earth

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.430
has incredibly thin air. At the top of Mount Everest
there is only one third as much breathable oxygen

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.990
as there is down at sea level.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.520
Climbers can endure the conditions for short
periods of time if they acclimate for months,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.270
but if you were to teleport from wherever
you are right now directly to the summit of

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.590
Everest, you would most likely die within
only 2-3 minutes because there isn't enough

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.010
oxygen.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.240
Death would come even more quickly if you
were at the bottom of the Mariana Trench.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.830
There, you would be submerged under nearly
7 miles of water, about 11 km, causing the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.890
pressure around your body to exceed 15,000
pounds per square inch.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.280
At normal swimming depths you can always
hold your breath, but that far down, with

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.379
that much pressure, your lungs would collapse
immediately, and without oxygen your brain

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:32.769
would go unconscious in 15 seconds,
and you'd be dead in under 90.

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.299
You would die pretty much just as quickly
as someone who walked into outer space without

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:39.679
a suit on.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.460
But falling into a molten lake of lava is
probably the most spectacular way to go. Contrary

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.379
to what you see in many movies, your body
wouldn't just burn a little bit and slowly

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:59.019
sink as if it were in quicksand. 
Instead, there would be a lot of fireworks. Hot, molten

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:06.019
lava is liquid rock, 4 times as hot as your
oven can ever get. And the human body is

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:13.080
mainly made up of water, which, when exposed
to that kind of heat, turns into steam...explosively.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.579
There's a fantastic video right here on YouTube
where a guy throws a bag of organic material

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:24.859
containing a lot of moisture into hot lava.
It doesn't just sink in, it causes a miniature

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.480
eruption. I highly suggest you go watch it.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.169
But what if we want to measure danger not
by how quickly you would die, but by the actual

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:40.029
total number of fatalities caused. Well, for
this, we're going to need to get much, much

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:43.509
smaller. Like, microscopic.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:51.980
In 1918, influenza killed nearly 100 million
people, which, at the time, was 3% of the

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:59.959
world's entire population. But places where
and when the plague has spread rapidly are

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:10.239
even scarier. Between 1347 and 1353, a third
of everybody in Europe died because of the

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.260
bubonic plague,
an infection caused by Yersinia Pestis.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.700
It's easy to think of the plague as something
from way back in the past, but it is still

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.449
here. Of course, now we have antibiotics, which
can help in most cases, but, believe it or

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:34.629
not, in America alone, 5 to 15 people
still get the plague every year.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.919
In terms of total fatalities, however, the
plague and influenza are nothing compared

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.539
to the danger caused by this guy: plasmodium.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.720
It's a micro-organism that can get into our
blood because of mosquito bites, and causes

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:58.520
Malaria. Across the totality of human history,
the number of deaths attributed to Malaria

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.740
is unbelievable. Researchers like Nobel laureate
Baruch Blumberg have studied the history of

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.810
the human genome and human migration, and
determined that of all the humans who have

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:16.629
ever existed, it is likely that half died from malaria.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.159
So, in terms of total fatalities across all
of human history, a place where plasmodium

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:28.099
could enter the blood stream because of a
mosquito bite, statistically speaking, could

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:32.079
be called the most dangerous place on Earth.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.639
But let's switch gears for a moment and talk
about places that are dangerous not because

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:43.799
of Earth, or Earth's creatures, well, actually,
just one specific creature: us.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:51.280
La Oroya is a mining town in Peru where the
murder rate is low but pollution is high.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.439
The town's smelter emits pollution into the air
and temperature inversions in the atmosphere

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:04.659
above the town trap gasses within,
causing the town to have 85 times more arsenic in

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:07.279
its air than is deemed safe.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:13.040
But that's nothing compared to Lake Karachay
in Russia. It was named the most polluted

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.430
spot on Earth by the World Watch Institute
on Nuclear Waste.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:24.440
The lake contains so many radioactive pollutants
that you can receive a lethal dose of radiation

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:30.149
merely by standing for one hour near certain
parts of the lake.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.580
The Global Peace Index ranks countries by
how safe they are. It takes into account a

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.689
number of factors including crime and political
corruption. The safest country, according

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:47.709
to the Index, is Iceland.
And the least safe is Somalia.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:53.360
But for the highest murder rate you'll have
to go to Juarez, Mexico, where out of every

00:06:53.360 --> 00:07:00.360
1 million inhabitants, each year 1,477
of them are murdered.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.860
I've always found it amazing just how many
serial killers Miami seems to have on the

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:12.000
show "Dexter." But Miami is a big city and
so despite all those serial killers, it's

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.000
murder rate in the show is not the highest
of any fictional town from a TV show. That

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.000
honor goes to Cabot Cove, the town where "Murder
She Wrote" occurred. An analysis of "Murder

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:35.440
She Wrote" episodes revealed 274 murders,
but a population in the town of only 3,500,

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:42.229
making Cabot Cove's murder rate
1,490 per million inhabitants.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:48.420
Until recently that number was unmatched by
reality, but last year, the city of San Pedro

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:57.390
Sula in Honduras reported a murder rate of
1,588 murders per million inhabitants.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:05.680
Let's conclude by revisiting pollution, specifically
the Chernobyl accident, and a certain oxymoronic

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:14.499
danger. For 10 days in 1986, radioactive isotopes
spilled out of a blazing reactor core, forcing

00:08:14.499 --> 00:08:20.550
mass evacuations. It's more than 25 years
later now and many parts of the exclusion

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:28.020
zone remain incredibly lethal. But without
humans there, many parts of the exclusion

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:35.760
zone have seen wildlife flourish, especially
endangered species which can go to the exclusion

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:44.840
zone, live, reproduce, and be safe...from us.
We managed to ruin a place to the point

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:50.660
at which it endangered our lives and we had
to leave and in doing so we left parts

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:56.279
of it a little bit safer for other forms of life.

00:08:56.279 --> 00:09:00.200

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.280

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:01.960
Keep learning.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.420
And as always,

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.660
thanks for watching.
