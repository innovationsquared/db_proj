00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:08.670
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And the iTunes store contains 28 million different songs.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:15.740
Last.fm carries 45 million songs and the
Gracenote database of artists, titles, and

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:24.240
labels contains 130 million different songs.
That's a lot. If you were to listen to all

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.650
of the songs in the Gracenote database one
after the other in a giant playlist, it would

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.570
take you more than 1,200 years to complete.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.579
But since there are a finite number of tones
our ears can distinguish and because it only

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:48.699
takes a few notes in common for two musical
ideas to sound similar, will we ever run out

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.940
of new music?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.940
Will there ever be a day where every possible
brief little melody has been written and recorded

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.940
and we are left with nothing new to make?

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.600
A good rule of thumb might be to say that
if modern recording technology can't distinguish

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.060
the difference between two songs, well, neither
could we. So, let's begin there, with digital

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.220
downloads, MP3's, CD's, and a calculation
made by Covered in Bees.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.439
Digital music is made out of "bits."
Lots and lots of bits. But each individual bit

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.720
exists in one of two states: a "0" or a "1."

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.439
Now, what this means in that for any given,
say, 5-minute-long audio file, the number

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:42.759
of possibilities, mathematically speaking,
is enormous, but mind-blowingly finite.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:51.419
A compact disk, which samples music at 44.1
kHz, is going to need about 211 million bits

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.259
to store one 5-minute song. And because a
bit can exist in two states, either a "0"

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:03.610
or a "1," the number of possible different
ways to arrange those 211,000,000 bits is

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.930
2 to the 211th million power.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.180
That value represents every single possible
different 5-minute-long audio file. But how

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.390
big is that number?
Well, let's put this in perspective.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:29.920
A single drop of water contains 6 sextillion
atoms. 6 sextillion is 22 digits long. That's

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.080
a long number. But the total number of atoms
that make up the entire earth is a number

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.950
that is about 50 digits long. And estimations
of the total number of hydrogen atoms in our

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.070
universe is a number that is 80 digits long.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:55.480
But "2 to the 211 millionth power," the number
of possible, different 5-minute audio files, is a number

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:07.900
that is 63 million digits long. It is a number
larger than we can even pretend to understand.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.620
It contains every possible CD quality 5-minute
audio file. Inside that amount is everything

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.320
from Beethoven's "5th" to Beck's "Loser" -
it even contains a 5 minute conversation you

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.970
had with your parents when you were 3 years old.
In fact, every one of them. It even contains

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.570
every possible conversation you didn't have
with your parents when you were 3 years old.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:38.500
But, it is finite, not infinite. It's cool
to think about, but it doesn't come very close

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.350
to answering the question of this video, which
is "how many possible different songs can

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.230
we create and hear the difference between?"

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.510
So, for that, we're going to need to narrow
down our hunt.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.100
On Everything2, Ferrouslepidoptera made a
calculation that involved some assumptions

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.020
that I think helped narrow the field down
in a really nice way.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.300
She took a look at the total number of possible
different melodies you could create within

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:15.010
one octave, containing any or all of the intervals
we divide octaves into. Of course, sound frequencies

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.570
can be divided much more granularly than that,
but giving ourselves more notes might mean

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.520
we could make more technically different melodies,
but they wouldn't necessarily sound any different

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.730
to our ears.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.540
Now, given a single measure containing any
combination of whole, half, quarter, eighth,

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:39.740
sixteenth or thirty-second notes, she calculated
that there would be this many possible unique

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:46.690
measures, which is a smaller number than we
had before, but, to put it in perspective,

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.190
this is how many seconds old the universe is.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:59.040
Yerricde's calculation is even more specific.
He stayed within one octave, but instead of

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:06.040
looking at a complete measure, he only considered
the number of unique combinations of 8 notes.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.210
He also assumed that typical melodies, as
we know them today, only contain about three

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.770
different types of note length. For instance, quarter, eighth and sixteenth or whole,

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.140
half and quarter.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:25.500
To be sure, that will most likely not always
be true. Musical tastes hundreds, thousands

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:32.360
of years from now will most assuredly be different,
but given melodies as we know them today,

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:41.140
across 8 notes, over 12 intervals, there are
about 79 billion possible combinations.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:48.080
We're getting relatively small here. I mean,
under this definition of melody, 100 songwriters

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:54.090
creating a brand new 8-note melody every second
would exhaust every possible melody within

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.290
only 248 years.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.980
But it's still a huge number, way bigger than
the total number of songs that have been written

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:08.940
that we know about. So, you can quite safely
say that, no, we will never run out of new

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:18.480
music. But here's the rub. If that's the case,
why are there so many commonalities between

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:24.480
songs? Even across hundreds of years, how
come so many songs kind of sound the same?

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.900
I mean, if we have more possibilities than
we could ever exhaust, why is "Twinkle Twinkle

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:35.170
Little Star," the "Alphabet Song," and "Baa,
Baa, Black Sheep," all the same melody?

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:40.170
"My Country Tis of Thee," and "God Save the
Queen," interestingly enough, are the same

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.860
song.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.800
"Love Me Tender," is exactly the same as the
old American Civil War song "Aura Lea."

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.920
And a seemingly uncountable number of songs
merely sound like other songs. The Spongebob

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.490
Squarepants theme has a very similar cadence
to "Blow the Man Down."

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:13.190
Soundsjustlike.com is a great resource for
exploring this further. It'll show you two

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.870
songs and how they sort of sound alike.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.440
And when it comes to musical chords,
it's almost as if there's no variety at all, as

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:36.830
was famously shown by The Axis of Awesome's
"4 Chords." I've linked it in the description,

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.669
it's worth a watch if you haven't seen it
already. These guys sing more than 40 different

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:45.409
songs using the same four chords...

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:52.800
Even though the number of possible different
melodies is gigantic, us humans tend to gravitate

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:57.400
towards certain patterns that we like more
than others and we are influenced by what

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:04.230
came before us. Kirby Ferguson has a fantastic
series looking into this called "Everything

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:08.770
is a Remix." I've also linked that down in
the description. The commonalities he shows

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:10.360
are pretty crazy.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:16.350
Well, even when it comes to lyrics, to writing,
even though, mathematically, there are more

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:22.670
possibilities than we could ever exhaust,
we have gravitated towards a few. In fact,

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:29.740
there's a form of poetic meter that is so
common it's called "Common Meter."

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.820
I've composed a verse using it to explain what it is.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:41.880
Line one contains eight syllables. The next
contains just six. For emphasis: iambic stress.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.300
That's it, no other tricks.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:52.560
Here is a list of songs that are written in common
meter, also known as "Balad Meter." The commonness

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:58.550
of common meter is the reason you can sing
the Pokemon theme song to the tune of Gilligan's

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:06.380
Island. Or House of the Rising Sun. Or Amazing
Grace. You could also use almost any of Emily

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.860
Dickinson's poetry. Sure, they're different
melodies, but their lyrics are written in

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.720
the same meter.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.580
There's a great video on YouTube that I've
linked below in the description that uses

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.050
captions to let you see just how these all
fit together.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:27.040
Oh, and don't forget one of the greatest compositions
taking advantage of common meter's commonness:

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.060
Stairway to Gilligan's Island.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:35.280
And you know what? Our brains may also be
keeping us from enjoying the entire mathematical

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:42.290
space of available songs. For instance,
research has shown that the way a song compresses,

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:50.660
using software, can help us predict how enjoyable
it will be. Too simple, too easy to compress,

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:57.820
like, say, a rising scale, and the song doesn't
challenge us - it's boring. But too complicated,

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:03.240
say, white noise, and the file won't compress
very much at all, and, likewise, we don't

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:09.170
seem to enjoy it. There's a magic zone where
a file is compressible by a computer, and

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.750
also happens to be enjoyable by us.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:19.080
So, interestingly, even though mathematically
speaking, there are so many possible unique

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:25.240
melodies that we can safely say, there will
always be room for new music, we don't seem

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:32.460
to be wired to care. We enjoy certain patterns
and melodies and calculating how many there

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:37.930
could be is a lot less interesting than how
connected and similar all the ones that we

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:44.760
enjoy are. It's as if we have more space than
we need, more space than we could ever hope

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:51.029
to see all of, or visit all of, or know all
of, but no matter what new place we go, in

00:10:51.029 --> 00:10:57.370
a general sense, new, popular music will always
remind us a bit of home.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:58.700
And as always,

00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.680
thanks for watching.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:16.140
Fantastic, you're still here. If you want
to hear music from people like you, from Vsaucers,

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:21.500
go check out WeSauce. You can submit music,
animation, short films, anything that you're

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:26.940
making and putting on YouTube to us and we'll
feature it on WeSauce. It's like a trailer

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.649
for what Vsaucers are doing.

00:11:29.649 --> 00:11:34.529
Speaking of which, Jake Chudnow, who does
all of the music in these videos, has a brand

00:11:34.529 --> 00:11:39.220
new song out over on his channel,
which I highly suggest you go give a listen.
