00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.929
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And our faces

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.919
have a lot of holes.
We have two ears and two eyes.

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.679
It makes sense, because the difference in
time it takes for a sound to reach one ear

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:12.480
and the other,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.980
allows us to localize where the sound is coming from.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.820
And having two eyes gives us two
slightly different perspectives that we

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.890
can put together

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.439
in order to perceive depth.
But why do we have two

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.650
nostrils?
I mean, our sense of smell isn't good enough to localize

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.390
one nostril over the other,
why not just have a big hole in our nose,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.600
like we have a mouth.
Well, Stanford University's olfactory research

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.430
project

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.340
investigated this and they found that
throughout the day

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.020
one nostril inhales air better and faster

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.600
than the other. Now, which one is dominant
changes throughout the day, but having

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.239
a good air sucking nostril and a not so good

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.960
air sucking nostril is important.
We need both,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.920
because you see, odorants and molecules
are absorbed by our skin and snot

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.500
at different rates.
Some things are absorbed so quickly

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.020
they need to be rushed on the olfactory
receptors before they're

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.340
absorbed earlier on in the nose.
Other

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.240
molecules, other odorants, are slowly absorbed

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.369
and they need to be given time to get to
the receptors and not just rushed right

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:23.250
to the lungs.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.549
And so having two nostrils allows us to smell

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.670
more things.
Alright,

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.670
so let's smell some weird stuff, like

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.710
outer space.
What would space smell like?

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.280
Okay, right, it's a tough question,
it actually doesn't make much sense because

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.820
space

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.500
is a mere vacuum.
If you went into space and took your helmet off to

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.899
smell it, well, all of the air in your lungs
and throat, nose would be violently

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.420
sucked right out. In fact, even if you
really tried to get some sort of

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.030
olfactory sensation, about all you
would feel is the quick evaporation of

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.399
water coming out of your mucous membranes

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.190
and you might smell,
for the few seconds that you were conscious,

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.480
nasal fluid and blood.
That doesn't sound fun at all.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.099
But here's the thing.
Objects

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.980
that have been taken out into space and
then returned to a

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.459
habitable atmosphere, like inside a space station,

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.450
smell differently than they did before

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.360
they went into space.
Astronauts report that their suits,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.290
after being in space, have a strange metallic

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.370
burn meat arc welder fumes smell.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.860
It's believed that the odor is caused by
high energy particles

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.220
that cling to the suit and then, once brought inside,

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.890
react with the air, creating a burning

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.550
smell.
One particular type of high energy molecule found

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.670
all over interstellar space are polycyclic

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.310
aromatic hydrocarbons.
These guys are the result

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.239
of combustion. And in 2004,
the University of Toledo, Ohio found evidence

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.360
that those very molecules may exist in old

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.290
nebula. The result of convection currents 
cooling carbon and hydrogen

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.290
allowing them to bond into giant shapes.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.930
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are also formed,

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.360
when cooking meat at high temperatures.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.879
So, in order to train astronauts even
more realistically here on earth,

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.500
NASA actually reached out to Steven
Pearce of Omega Ingredients

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.110
to replicate the smell of things that
have been to space

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.129
as a perfume.
If we know the chemical makeup of something,

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.659
even something light years away from us,
we can assemble those ingredients

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.840
here on earth and get an idea of what it would

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.299
smell like.
Recently, researchers have discovered

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.629
Ethyl Formate in the dust cloud Sagittarius

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.180
B2.
Now, again, if you were to go there

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.360
and lift up your space suits visor and take a whiff,

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.170
you would die. You wouldn't be able to take
a whiff, all of the air in your nose and

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.620
lungs and throat would be

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.919
immediately expelled.
But if you were able to take a

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.790
bucket of Sagittarius B2 home with you to earth

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.030
and then give it a smell,
because of the ethyl formate

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.240
Sagittarius B2's stuff

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.410
would smell like raspberries and rum.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.729
Pretty neat, right?
But let's get closer to home.

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.490
What does the inside of your nose

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.890
smell like?

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.610
Well, it's kind of hard to know
because we are smelling it

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.850
all the time and our bodies become desensitized

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.520
to constant stimuli to keep us from
being overloaded

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.720
and to keep us prepared to sense any out
of the ordinary smells that

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.300
we might need to know about.
This happens to us all the time.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.919
When you first step into a restaurant,
you can smell all the food,

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.020
but halfway through the meal you're
no longer aware of the smell.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.320
It's called neural adaptation.
I guess the point I'm trying to make

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.139
is that in order to figure out what the
inside of a nose smells like

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.370
you'll need to smell a novel one,

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.940
like, for instance, smell the inside of your friend's nose.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.570
It might seem weird at first,
but it could be a great way to form

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:34.039
new memories. Our sense of smell may not
be as acute as our other senses,

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:38.639
but it seems to be tied to memories very very closely.

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.720
A single whiff of an odor can instantly
remind you of where you used to smell

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.610
that smell

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.940
and maybe even who you were with.
This may be

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.930
because of the olfactories' connection to
the limbic system

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.110
in the brain.
Olfactory information is sent

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.190
through the limbic system,
which is known to be involved with

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.750
emotions and memories.
No other traditional sense is connected

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.009
to the limbic system in this way.
We've also found

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:09.330
that patients who have memory loss
caused by brain damage

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.139
tend to also have an impaired ability

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.900
to smell.
So treasure your sense of smell,

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.069
because it not only keeps us safe from gross

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:25.150
odors or rotten food, it can also keep us safe

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.610
from incest.
Individuals who are

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.690
raised together in the same home for the
first few years of their life,

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.860
whether they are genetically related or not,

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.949
will tend to be less physically
attracted to each other

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:43.520
later in life than they are to strangers.
This is known

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.630
as the Westermarck effect and one of the
main mechanisms it works via

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:53.650
is the olfactory system.
Us humans have an interesting ability to

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.770
distinguish the smell of a stranger

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.020
from someone that we are genetically related to or

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.080
grew up in very close proximity with.
This entire phenomenon may be a

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.800
natural way for us to avoid inbreeding.

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:12.419
But what about someone who can't smell?

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:16.360
What do we call them?
Someone who can't see is blind,

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.650
someone who can't hear is deaf and
someone who can't speak is mute,

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.979
but what do you call someone who can't smell?

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:28.169
Well, there's a word for the inability to smell - anosmia.

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:31.830
Now, even though the adjective form is very very rare,

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:35.590
it exists.
A person who can't smell

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.610
is anosmic.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.020
There's another word we should have
investigated a long time ago.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.280
Olfactory.
What does is it come from? Well,

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.430
the "ol" part comes from odor and from smell,

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.949
but "factory?"
Well, factories make

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:55.599
things, but the nose doesn't makes smells,

00:07:55.599 --> 00:07:58.159
it smells smells.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.560
Right?
Well, here's the thing. We

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.610
smell objects because molecules from those

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.240
objects react in certain ways with our olfactory

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.379
receptors.
And molecules have

00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:19.460
specific shapes and vibrations and ways of behaving,

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.919
but the smell is not actually

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:26.440
intrinsic to the molecule.
The smell is merely a

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.160
consequence of how that molecule reacts

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.680
with us.
No us,

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.560
no smell.
So, olfactory

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.450
is a fantastic word.
Every sight

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:45.690
and feeling and sound and smell we get
from our universe

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.899
is actually just the universe reacting with

00:08:48.899 --> 00:08:52.490
us.
Everything we know about the universe we know

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.920
because it has already been processed
and changed and analyzed and filtered

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.830
inside the factory of our sense.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:02.730
And as always,

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:03.910
thanks for watching.
