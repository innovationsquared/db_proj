00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.500
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
But you are

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.629
actually right there.
Well, at least

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.309
the camera is.
Mirrors are amazing.

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.599
In fact, the word "mirror" comes from Latin "mirari",

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.020
meaning "to wonder at, to admire."

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.529
It's also where we get the word miracle.
Mirror-

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.619
-acle. Like when mirrors face each other
and transform a toilet room

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.359
into infinity.
I love this kind of stuff.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.590
But what if instead of a rectangular prism,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.700
the room was a sphere, mirrored

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.820
all the way around?
What would it look like?

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.340
What would you see floating around in
such a room? The first question we should

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.480
ask involves

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.199
the light source. If you were in this room
using a flashlight and you turned the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.620
flashlight off,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.680
would the light keep bouncing around off of
the mirrored walls,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.430
illuminating the room until your body
absorbed all of it?

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.729
Or if you left the flashlight on,
would light continue

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.939
bouncing around, building up, getting
brighter and brighter until you lost

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:11.100
your vision and cooked?

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.070
Probably not.
Every time light

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.150
hits a mirror and reflects off,
a tiny tiny amount

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.360
is absorbed. Even if your mirror
spherical room was the size of a

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.820
giant stadium and its walls reflected

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.990
99.99% of light

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.409
on each reflection, light speed is just too fast,

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.280
meaning that the reflections will happen
rapidly, a little bit of light being lost

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.119
each time.

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.030
The room will go dark in a fraction of
a fraction of a second. To you and me,

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.560
it would seem instantaneous.
As for what it would look like,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.310
let's pretend you begin with your face
up against a wall of

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.920
the sphere and float backward
toward and past the centre.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.399
At first, you would see your face quite clearly.

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.460
The surrounding reflections would be
very distorted. As you moved away,

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.549
at a certain point your face would cease
to shrink away in appear smaller

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.649
in mirror and instead would grow larger
and become magnified

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.069
until you reach the center at which
point your face would fill

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.840
your field of view. As you continued on past
the center, your image would flip

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.120
upside down and continue receding away.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.810
It would look a bit like this.
But don't get too enamoured

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.480
with your reflection because mirrors
don't show you

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.819
as you really are.

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.049
Have you ever wondered why you liked the
way you look in a

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.909
mirror but don't like how you look in
photographs or

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.929
video?
It might be because of the

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:50.600
mere-exposure effect.
You prefer what you are used to

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.099
and most mirrors you look into don't show

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.840
the real you, the you that other people in cameras

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.599
see.
Instead, a mirror shows you a reversed

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.639
version of yourself and you've become
more comfortable with that version

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:09.389
of you.
A version of you that is flipped left to right.

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:14.310
Mirrors reverse along axes perpendicular
to their surfaces,

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.579
like left and right. They don't also flip
things upside down, they don't also

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.040
reverse up and down because those directions

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.469
are parallel to the surface of the mirror.
When it comes to the way you and

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:26.510
other people look,

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.620
the difference can be startling. 
NPR pointed out that Abraham Lincoln

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.359
looked like

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.639
this.
Mirrored he would have looked like

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.669
this. Now to us, something seems
noticeably strange about it but it is

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:41.639
the Lincoln

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.180
Lincoln would have preferred.
It's what he saw every day

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.810
in the mirror.
But here's something really cool.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.099
You can take a flexible mirror and

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.209
unreverse its image by folding the mirror

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.409
into a cylindrical shape.
Take a look at this.

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.409
Here I am with a reflective material and there

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:05.599
is the camera with some text taped underneath,
as you can see everything is

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.959
flipped left to right.
But as I fold the sheet into a cylindrical shape

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.069
the image separates, revealing an unreversed

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.739
version.
It becomes a true mirror.

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.090
Finally, here is one last piece

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.310
of every day mirror trickery.
When you look into a mirror,

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.240
how big is your reflection, your image

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.430
on the surface of the mirror to you?
Surely,

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.570
it depends on how far away you are from the mirror.
But it doesn't.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.300
When you look into a mirror your
reflection on the surface of that mirror

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.750
is

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.210
always the exact same size.
In fact, it is always

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.289
about half of your actual size.
This is because

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.370
when light reflects off a mirror,
it comes in

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.990
and reflects back out at the same angle,
which means that

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.360
in order to reach your eyes at the top of your body,

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.630
light from your feet at the bottom must hit the mirror

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.039
halfway between the two.
The triangles you form

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.219
with a mirror are similar, regardless of

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:15.659
where you stand.
You can demonstrate this effect by

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:20.380
outlining the size of your own head as
it appears on the surface of a mirror

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.919
using a bar of soap.
Now, because you aren't here

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:27.919
let's pretend that this phone is your
head and its camera

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.900
is your eye.
We begin up close. The camera looks

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.169
really big from this perspective.
Let me just

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.729
carefully trace around the outside,
so we can compare later.

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:46.870
Good, good, good. Okay.
Now, I'm going to pull away from the mirror. Clearly

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.900
the phone is smaller, right?
Well,

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.900
if I reach out and once again carefully
trace the edges.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.440
There we go.
I will find that I have drawn a

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.610
rectangle that is the exact same size.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.770
Your image on the surface of a mirror

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.169
from your own perspective is always the
same size, whether you are a few

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.760
centimeters away from the mirror

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.860
or a few kilometres away.
Your image on the surface of a mirror in fact is

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.750
always half your actual size.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.150
Okay, enough about light returning to our eyes.
What about light

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.800
that never returns?

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.930
Could we use a telescope to resolve individual

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.180
aliens on a planet light years away?
Well, over on Vsauce3,

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.750
Jake investigates this question with Star Wars.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.500
And my friend Rusty investigates the
potential for Star Wars

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.200
becoming real in his episode of Science Friction.
And

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.030
Vsauce2 has a brand new lÃ¼t all about cool

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.850
Star Wars stuff.
Check them all out.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:53.680
And as always,

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.440
thanks for watching.
