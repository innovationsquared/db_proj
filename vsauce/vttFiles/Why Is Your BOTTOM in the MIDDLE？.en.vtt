00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.780
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.780
A human, running like a quadruped, is creepy.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.660
Artist Rui Martins created this animation

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.219
about a year ago. 127 years ago

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:21.020
Eadweard Muybridge shot these real images
of a child with infantile paralysis

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.640
walking on all fours. Walking upright

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.800
looks less unnatural, our bodies are
particularly well suited for it. It's one

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.640
of the things

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.010
the bulbous and prominent

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.940
human bottom helps us do.
But let's get to the bottom

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.020
of a linguistic mystery. Why is the bottom

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.160
called a bottom, when it's in the middle of the body?

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.230
Your feet and legs are almost always

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.270
at the same level or below your bottom.
I mean, except for

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.840
Navasana, the yoga boat pose, your bottom is

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.309
anything but the actual bottom of your body.

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.049
Unfortunately, there is no clear-cut

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.799
answer, but there are butt loads of cool things to learn

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.040
about butts. A buttload is not just a
joke amount. It is a very specific

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.189
unit of measurement. Historically, it was
used to describe the capacity

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.450
of a wine cask. A butt is about

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.520
477 litres, which means,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.689
given the average volume of solid waste

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.780
the rectum holds, when a person says they have a

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.369
buttload of something... Technically,

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.640
they are saying they have enough of that thing to fill

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.409
3,200 butts. Using the word

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.670
bottom to refer to your posterior is relatively new.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.590
Cedric Watts has presented evidence that
in the late 16th century bottom could

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.130
connote the human rear end,

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.740
but the first published use wasn't until 1794

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.020
in Erasmus Darwin's 'Zoonomia'.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.159
The word bottom comes from words meaning

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.400
'foundation', 'the lowest level'.
But when standing or sitting,

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.489
the soles of your feet are more properly

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.200
at the bottom, and, sure enough, sole also means

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.510
'foundation', 'bottom'.
What's going on here is probably a combination

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.580
of torso-centric thinking and euphemism.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.640
Bottom is a nice word for a sometimes

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.060
dirty part and your bottom is the bottom
of your digestive tract and

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.720
the bottom of your torso, the bottom of your body,

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.430
if you exclude your limbs. For Prince Randian,

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.420
a man born in 1871 in British Guiana,

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.390
the bottom was the bottom.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.400
Because of tetra-amelia syndrome, he was born with no

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.379
limbs at all. In 1889 P.T. Barnum brought him
to the United States to perform

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:00.440
in carnivals. And you can see him
light a cigarette with no arms

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.629
or feet in the 1932 film

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:10.040
"Freaks". Bottom is just one of many words
we have for the posterior,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.379
the rear, the backside, derrière, bum,

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.340
buns or, in reference to its round shape, moon.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.430
Which is why exposing your bare buttocks

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.239
is known as mooning, an offensive gesture.

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.690
The earliest known instance of mooning was
recorded by Flavius Josephus. It occurred

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.000
in 66 A.D.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.299
A Roman soldier mooned

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.659
a group of Jews headed to a temple in Jerusalem.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.700
His act of mooning spawned a riot and the subsequent

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.209
overreaction on the part of the Roman military led to the

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.519
deaths of thousands of people.

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.810
If you get mooned you will,

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.739
just like a guy who died September 14th,
1865 and is now buried in West Laurens, New York,

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.659
Seymour Butts. At least he didn't
share his name with a former

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.500
representative of New Hampshire's

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.170
second district. The word 'bum'

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.110
predates the use of the word bottom for the rear by quite

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.759
a lot. It's believed that the word bum
originated as an onomatopoeia for the

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:17.459
sound of

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.070
buttocks slapping against a flat surface.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.630
Seriously. Lazily sitting around on your

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.949
bum all day gave American English the word

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.300
bum, a loafer, an idle person.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.389
And bum's connotation of uselessness, poor quality

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.220
caused it to lend itself in the late 1960s to the word

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.830
'bummer', an experience that was worthless - 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.580
a letdown. But to be clear, your butt

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.150
is a bottom, kind of. It's a bum

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.070
but it is not a bummer.
Your butt is magnificent, an example

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.630
of what makes the human body so different.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.610
Its shape comes from the
gluteus maximus and gluteus medius muscles as

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.900
well as a layer

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.660
of fat.
That layer of fat makes the bottom a great cushion

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.759
for sitting. Other animals have to sit

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:16.370
by resting weight on their legs
because they lack the nice

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:23.050
bulbous butt of the human. Evolutionary
psychology suggests that our attraction to full

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.310
firm bottoms on potential mates was probably

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.660
naturally selected. People in the past who liked

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.750
big ol' bottoms probably spread their genes quite

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.930
well. They probably had a lot of
reproductive success because the calle

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.009
pigeon bottom

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:41.169
is a sign of health and youth. A bottom full of shapely fat

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.740
is a great energy reserve.
That energy can come in quite handy if

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.830
food suddenly become scarce or during pregnancy

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.030
or breast feeding. There's a great reddit
thread you can read if you'd like this

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.360
evolutionary psychology approach wrapped up in a

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.419
Sir Mix-a-Lot's "I like big butts" package.

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:05.600
Because we are bipedal in order to keep
our torsos balanced while moving

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.430
we require relatively giant and prominent

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.300
muscles in our bottoms, muscles that are so prominent

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:20.160
we have, compared to other apes,
very defined intergluteal clefts.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.740
Butt cracks. This makes

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.080
certain hygienic practices more common in humans

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.419
than other animals. But those prominent muscles

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:34.600
are worth it. Compared to horses and other quadrupeds

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.850
humans can reach impressive long-distance

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.960
aerobic endurance running speeds.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.569
This is Katarina Johnson-Thompson,
an Olympic athlete from Great Britain

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:48.819
and an excellent example of the fact that humans

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:51.499
are the running animal.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.200
Hi Michael.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.860
Hi Katarina. Take a look at this.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.699
I'll make it brief, but above and beyond
other animals, humans can:

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:04.739
sweat to efficiently dump body heat,
we have short toes to provide more efficient

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.319
force over long periods of running,
our short neck ligaments keep our head perfectly

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:10.930
stable when running,

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.810
our uniquely well-developed
Achilles tendon converts elastic energy into

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:15.650
kinetic energy

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:21.210
very well and our tall narrow waists
provide great counter rotation as our legs

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.240
swing backwards and forwards.
I like how PZ Myers

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.479
sums it up: "Over long distances, the average

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:32.330
speed sustained by a horse is less
than that of the human,

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.400
which means that a well-trained
conditioned human being

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.840
can keep up with, or even outrun, a horse

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.620
if the race is sustained long enough."

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.510
For this reason endurance running is
still practiced by a few people on Earth

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:53.080
as a form of hunting and it may have
been vitally important to prehistoric people.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.570
Before domesticated animals and
projectile weapons and traps,

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.300
humans caught animals for food in an incredibly

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.610
athletic way. David Attenborough
documented this practice fantastically.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:06.270
You should

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:11.140
definitely watch this clip. An animal
will sprint away from running human

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.740
hunters but eventually

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:17.050
have to rest. Humans, on the other hand,
though slow in the short run

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.940
can keep going. Like the tortoise, they eventually beat

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.840
the hare and can walk right up to the
exhausted and overheated

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.290
animal to kill it. We don't have

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:32.840
dangerous claws or massive teeth and
we can pretty much

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.840
only outsprint vegetables.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.540
But, in the long run, thanks to things like our impressive

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:42.969
butts, we have superior endurance

00:08:42.969 --> 00:08:46.370
when it comes to running. It may be called a bottom

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:51.520
but it's at the top of the list of things
that make the human body amazing.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.740
This video was inspired by Sport Relief.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:58.960
A great cause that uses sport to raise
money for vulnerable people here in the

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.460
UK and abroad.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.950
Check the description of this video to
learn more and watch their interactive

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.280
video about how you

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.130
can help out and get involved.
But wait a second,

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:13.640
if our bodies are so well developed
for endurance running

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.720
how come we don't all run marathons?

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.330
How come we don't all enjoy running

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:25.470
or do a lot of it? Well, the thing is all of
this running specialization was

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:26.840
naturally selected

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.470
because it helped our prehistoric ancestors survive.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:36.370
Actually enjoying all of that running was not
naturally selected, it was just a part of their

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.810
daily lives. But that doesn't mean that today you can't

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.180
get off your butt, use your butt and be proud of it.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.740
The next time someone calls you a butthead say

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:51.800
"thanks, I always knew my head was a
superlative object that set me apart from

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.200
the animal kingdom."

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.160
Katarina

00:09:56.149 --> 00:09:57.069
And as always,

00:09:57.069 --> 00:09:58.189
thanks for watching.
