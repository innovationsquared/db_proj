00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
Hey, Vsauce Michael here, and a couple of weeks ago,

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.309
Vice's new channel Noisey blind folded me,

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:10.889
the Gregory Brothers, about 200 other people,

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.059
and then bused us to a hidden skrillex show.

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.639
It was cool, but what is cool?

00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:26.359
I mean, what does it mean to be cool?

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.789
Cool is a judgement of taste.

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.959
People who are cool are with it.

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:35.789
They exhibit a style people want to emulate,
they're fashionable.

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:41.129
But being cool isn't just about confidence or being above the situation.

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.339
In fact, what is considered cool changes
all the time.

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:48.309
Here's a fantastic illustration charting

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.229
by time and location what was generally considered cool.

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:56.989
To truly get the origin of what we today mean by cool,

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.369
we're going to have to go back to West Africa
in the 15th Century.

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:05.279
The Yoruba language has a great word, itutu.

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:09.749
It means physical beauty, but also being calm

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:12.379
and detached from your circumstances,

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:14.459
almost unnaturally so

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:16.549
in a superhuman kind of way.

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.219
And a similar, more specific term comes from the Italian concept of sprezzatura.

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:28.097
This was a way of behaving favored by the wealthy upper class in 15th Century Italy.

00:01:28.097 --> 00:01:30.393
And to exhibit this behavior,

00:01:30.393 --> 00:01:34.812
you wanted to act nonchalant, even
if doing so would take a lot of work.

00:01:34.812 --> 00:01:37.189
You would hide your desires and emotions

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.891
behind ironic detachment.

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:42.736
But where can you see sprezzatura?

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:46.747
Well, how about here—the Mona Lisa.

00:01:46.747 --> 00:01:50.699
She doesn't laugh.
She's exercising restraint.

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:55.258
It almost feels like she's looking down on you, smugly.

00:01:55.258 --> 00:01:59.921
Now, to make this more clear, let's take a look at a recent discovery, a painting,

00:01:59.921 --> 00:02:04.675
that used to be thought of as a copy of the Mona Lisa made years and years later.

00:02:04.675 --> 00:02:10.374
Except, recent restoration has shown that the very same mistakes and corrections

00:02:10.374 --> 00:02:14.481
that DaVinci made on the original
were also done on this painting,

00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:18.025
leading restorers to believe that this painting

00:02:18.025 --> 00:02:22.231
was made side by side with the actual Mona Lisa.

00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:24.273
Look at her expression.

00:02:24.273 --> 00:02:28.783
It's even more clear that she's looking at you like
"Huh, really?"

00:02:28.783 --> 00:02:32.453
"You think you're cool.  Okay."

00:02:32.453 --> 00:02:36.716
Related is the Italian concept of omerta.

00:02:36.716 --> 00:02:42.543
This is keeping your cool and not
telling the authorities anything about anybody.

00:02:42.543 --> 00:02:46.393
It's the type of attitude you see in movies like
Goodfellas or The Godfather.

00:02:46.393 --> 00:02:48.546
But our modern definition of cool

00:02:48.546 --> 00:02:51.381
may most directly come from slaves

00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:53.266
and prisoners.

00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:57.269
People in those positions are subjected to authority in a very direct way,

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.099
and any kind of rebellion against authority or fighting against it

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.950
is most certainly going to be answered with nothing but punishment and very little chance of success.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.486
And so instead, an attitude of
ironic detachment is taken on,

00:03:11.486 --> 00:03:14.361
which allows you to distance yourself from that authority

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:19.376
to be away from it, against it without actively confronting it and getting in trouble.

00:03:19.376 --> 00:03:21.799
Now, later on in the 1940s,

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.844
the actual word cool began to stick to this attitude.

00:03:26.844 --> 00:03:29.635
it came out of the smoke filled nightclubs

00:03:29.635 --> 00:03:32.510
where jazz, beatnik, and bohemian culture thrived.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.384
The only way to freshen up that smoke filled air

00:03:35.384 --> 00:03:38.473
was to open windows and let the cool

00:03:38.473 --> 00:03:40.718
night air in.

00:03:40.718 --> 00:03:44.187
Saxophonist Lester Young is credited with making this connection

00:03:44.187 --> 00:03:47.651
and popularizing the use of the word cool,

00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:52.741
even cooler is the fact that Lester also popularized the use of the word bread

00:03:52.741 --> 00:03:55.443
to mean money. Well look at that, the sun has come out.

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:59.618
That's cool. It also means that it's a
good time to talk about the brain.

00:03:59.618 --> 00:04:04.454
Laurence Steinberg points out that there are systems in the brain that mature as we get older.

00:04:04.454 --> 00:04:07.288
The first is the socioemotional network,

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:09.675
and this deal is social and emotional inputs.

00:04:09.675 --> 00:04:13.211
Second is the cognitive control network.

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:17.132
This deals with regulating behavior
and making ultimate decisions.

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:20.850
But these two networks do not mature at the same rate.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.812
In fact, there's an awkward period
in puberty and adolescence

00:04:24.812 --> 00:04:27.726
where the social emotional network in our brain

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:30.316
is more active, and so, whether or not people

00:04:30.316 --> 00:04:33.110
think you are cool matters more to you

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.904
than is reasonable.

00:04:35.904 --> 00:04:39.114
So in a way, you could say that the less worried you are with

00:04:39.114 --> 00:04:42.913
being cool, the more developed your brain is.

00:04:42.913 --> 00:04:46.540
Instead, focus on vocabulary.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.918
The only thing that doesn't change, the only
coolness that doesn't fade

00:04:50.918 --> 00:04:54.504
is cool—the word.

00:04:54.504 --> 00:04:57.674
Over the years, we have used all
kinds of other words

00:04:57.674 --> 00:05:02.642
to mean cool, but the one that has never changed,
the one that has always been cool to use

00:05:02.642 --> 00:05:04.938
is cool.

00:05:04.938 --> 00:05:08.189
And that's cool.  Go check out that skrillex concert footage.

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:11.064
Noisey is the channel that uploaded that new MIA video

00:05:11.064 --> 00:05:14.101
as well as MIAs responses to YouTube comments.

00:05:14.101 --> 00:05:17.951
And according to this guy, fat people
shouldn't be making music.

00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:21.740
All I know is, as always, thanks for watching.
