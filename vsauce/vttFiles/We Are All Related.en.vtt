[Vsauce]

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.546
Hey, Vsauce, Michael here,
and you guys

00:00:06.546 --> 00:00:10.029
are my family.

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:14.018
Scientifically speaking,
geneticists tell us

00:00:14.018 --> 00:00:17.593
that every single person on earth
is, at the least,

00:00:17.593 --> 00:00:20.565
50th cousins
with everybody else on earth.

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:24.071
It kind of has to be that way.

00:00:24.071 --> 00:00:28.251
Think of it like this—
you have two biological parents

00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:31.594
and four biological grandparents,

00:00:31.594 --> 00:00:34.961
and eight biological great-grandparents.
It keeps doubling.

00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:38.815
Well, if you follow your family tree
all the way back

00:00:38.815 --> 00:00:43.157
to the time of the ancient Romans,
64 generations ago,

00:00:43.157 --> 00:00:45.818
that tree would need

00:00:45.818 --> 00:00:50.114
one quintillion separate individuals,

00:00:50.114 --> 00:00:52.598
which is a number
that is larger

00:00:52.598 --> 00:00:56.821
than the number of humans
who have ever existed. Ever.

00:00:56.821 --> 00:00:58.821
So what does that mean?

00:00:58.821 --> 00:01:00.931
Well, I think Bill Bryson put it best
when he said,

00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:04.437
"You couldn't be here
without a little incest—

00:01:04.437 --> 00:01:08.430
actually, quite a lot of incest."

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.635
Nothing ridiculous, mind you,
but if you go far enough back

00:01:11.635 --> 00:01:14.676
in your family tree,
you're going to find that quite frequently,

00:01:14.676 --> 00:01:18.159
people who were distantly related
had kids.

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.989
In fact, if you are currently dating
or married to somebody

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:26.564
who is from your own country
and is of your own ethnicity,

00:01:26.564 --> 00:01:29.532
there's a one in five chance
that the two of you share

00:01:29.532 --> 00:01:34.338
a common family member
fewer than 10 generations ago.

00:01:35.638 --> 00:01:40.213
Furthermore, because our society
is becoming more and more mobile,

00:01:40.213 --> 00:01:44.903
our most recent common ancestor
is becoming more recent.

00:01:44.903 --> 00:01:48.896
Mathematical models are now showing us
that for everybody,

00:01:48.896 --> 00:01:52.426
every human on earth right now,
our most recent common ancestor

00:01:52.426 --> 00:01:56.164
probably lived
only 2,000 to 4,000 years ago.

00:01:56.164 --> 00:01:58.579
A recent study—it's a great one,
you should read it—

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.387
found that there was
a person alive

00:02:02.387 --> 00:02:06.984
as early as 300 B.C.
who is related

00:02:06.984 --> 00:02:10.560
to every single person alive
on Earth today.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.530
Their study also found
that that person most likely lived

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.572
in Taiwan
near a busy port city,

00:02:17.572 --> 00:02:20.680
so their descendants could quickly spread
around the world.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.790
Now, all that said, you only receive half
of your genetic information

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.391
from your mother
and half from your father,

00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:29.945
and as you go up your tree,
it's quite possible

00:02:29.945 --> 00:02:34.705
that distant, distant ancestors
had literally no contribution

00:02:34.705 --> 00:02:36.705
to your genome.

00:02:36.705 --> 00:02:40.440
So who are you?

00:02:41.574 --> 00:02:44.890
I've said this before,
but because bacteria

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.955
are so much smaller
than the average human body cell,

00:02:47.955 --> 00:02:51.507
your body contains
more bacteria

00:02:51.507 --> 00:02:54.456
than it contains its own cells.

00:02:54.456 --> 00:02:59.309
And forget about trying to remember
every individual cell and bacteria in your body.

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:01.717
They're constantly dying
and being replaced.

00:03:01.717 --> 00:03:04.524
Even cells like brain cells,
which seem to live

00:03:04.524 --> 00:03:07.957
for a very long time,
still take in new nutrients

00:03:07.957 --> 00:03:12.717
and expel waste, meaning
that within about every five years,

00:03:12.717 --> 00:03:17.639
every single atom
that used to make up your body

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.984
has been exchanged.

00:03:19.984 --> 00:03:22.539
Do you remember
what you were like five years ago?

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:26.811
Well, the atoms that make up your body,
they sure don't.

00:03:26.811 --> 00:03:31.359
This is a little existentially scary,
but it leads to a very good question.

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:35.004
How many atoms are inside my body
to begin with?

00:03:35.004 --> 00:03:38.394
How much is a billion atoms?

00:03:38.394 --> 00:03:40.739
Well, here's one way
to think about this.

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.733
If you were to count
one number greater every second,

00:03:44.733 --> 00:03:48.773
it would take you 12 days
to count to a million,

00:03:48.773 --> 00:03:50.886
and if you wanted to count
to a billion,

00:03:50.886 --> 00:03:54.996
that would take you 32 years.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.989
So a billion
is a very large number,

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.683
but not when it comes to atoms.

00:04:01.683 --> 00:04:06.066
Atoms are so inconceivably small
that even if you had

00:04:06.066 --> 00:04:09.521
a billion, say, sodium atoms,
their entire weight

00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:12.958
would only be
38 femtograms.

00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:17.114
Each individual cell
in your body,

00:04:17.114 --> 00:04:19.180
too small
to be even seen by the eye,

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.008
contains 100 times more atoms
than there are stars

00:04:25.008 --> 00:04:27.330
in the Milky Way galaxy.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.903
Multiply that by the number of cells
that make up

00:04:29.903 --> 00:04:33.316
what we call ourselves,
and each human body

00:04:33.316 --> 00:04:36.537
contains more atoms
than there are stars

00:04:36.537 --> 00:04:39.161
in the known universe.

00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:44.107
Numbers that large lead
to some pretty mind-blowing truths,

00:04:44.107 --> 00:04:46.823
for instance, this one mentioned
by Bill Bryson—

00:04:46.823 --> 00:04:51.258
because our bodies contain
so many atoms,

00:04:51.258 --> 00:04:53.882
and because we
so vigorously recycle them,

00:04:53.882 --> 00:04:58.990
statistically speaking,
about one billion of the atoms

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.007
inside your body
used to belong to Shakespeare.

00:05:03.007 --> 00:05:06.560
A billion of your atoms
used to belong to Beethoven.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.998
A billion of the atoms
in your body

00:05:08.998 --> 00:05:11.250
right now,
as you sit and watch this,

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.081
used to be inside the body
of Buddha.

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:19.678
You could also think of it this way—
a thousand years from now,

00:05:19.678 --> 00:05:22.926
when humans first land
on a planet

00:05:22.926 --> 00:05:25.364
outside of our solar system,
that first person

00:05:25.364 --> 00:05:28.963
to step onto the surface
of the alien planet—

00:05:28.963 --> 00:05:32.585
their body will contain
a billion atoms

00:05:32.585 --> 00:05:36.137
that are in you
right now.

00:05:37.554 --> 00:05:39.806
And as always,
thanks for watching.

00:05:41.083 --> 00:05:47.143
