00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.220
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And today we're
going to discuss déjà vu. What is it, and

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.880
why does it occur? You know, those moments
where the current situation feels like it's

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.600
happened before? You're certain it has, but
you don't know when, or how it became so familiar.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.540
It's difficult to scientifically study déjà vu because there's no reliable way to cause

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.430
it to happen in people's heads in a laboratory.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.340
But here's what we do know: humans don't seem
to experience déjà vu until they're at least

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.710
8 or 9 years old. It's most frequent in your
teens and twenties, and then tapers off as

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.010
you get older. So, it might have something
to do with brain development. In fact, we

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.050
should probably go get ourselves a brain.
That was easy. Now, like a stomach ache, déjà

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.130
vu may be a symptom with many possible causes.
A lot of the popular theories about what causes

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.199
it involve a disconnect that may be occurring
between the deep structures of the brain that

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.300
process our experiences unconsciously, and
the parts of the brain that are conscious

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.140
of what they experience, process it, and
then tell us what we're seeing.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.009
For the sake of simplicity, let's begin with
the visual system. Now, the brain sits in

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.439
your head like this, and your eyeballs are
over here seeing things, sending that signal

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.490
to the back of the brain, the Occipital lobe,
where visual cortex is. That's where the image

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.439
is processed and we become aware of what we're
seeing. But visual cortex isn't the first

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.509
stop that information makes. Instead, we know
that it stops in lots of other places. For

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.790
instance, the amygdala, where it may be processed
at an involuntary emotional level, and this

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:40.009
fun little part right here, #31, the tectum.
It's involved in preliminary visual processing

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.460
and helps control eye movements.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.840
Now, that fact is incredibly important because
what it means is that people with blindness

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.860
caused by brain damage to the visual cortex
cannot see anything. They don't report seeing

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.840
or recognizing anything; however, the other
preliminary parts of the brain that get that

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.460
message are still healthy, and so, despite
being legally blind, these people exhibit

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.060
what is known as blindsight.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.280
They can defy all odds and avoid an obstacle
course on the ground. They can also be presented

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.160
faces showing joy, or anxiety and fear, and
feel, without knowing why, at all, on Earth they feel

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.090
that way, a similar emotion.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.010
So, a lot is going on when we look at things,
and if those preliminary structures in the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.580
vision system allow certain blind people to
be oddly and unconsciously aware of what they're

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.660
looking at, we may have the ingredients we
need for this disconnect.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.740
Think of it this way. If I experience event
A and then B and then C, and the inner parts

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.400
of my brain commit it to memory and generate
an emotional response, but then, a fraction

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.080
of a second later, out-of-sync, my visual
cortex finally gets around to telling me,

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.500
the conscious aware part of my brain, what
I'm seeing. It will say "Ok guys, we're looking

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.950
at A, and then B, and then..." and then the
brain says "Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait,

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:07.630
and then C, right? That's already happened
I thought?..." and that may be déjà vu.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.160
But what could cause these processes, dealing
with the same information, to get temporarily

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.890
out-of-sync like that? Well, it's probably
a neurological abnormality, possibly an epileptic

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.310
episode where neurons all fire in sync. We
also know that patients who experience chronic

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.400
and persistent déjà vu tend to have brain
damage in the temporal lobes of their brain -

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.160
these lobes on either side.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.950
Well that sounds kinda bad, right? I mean, when I
experience déjà vu, should I run to the doctor

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.450
right away? Well, not at all. In fact, minor
epileptic events are quite common. You've

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.660
probably experienced a similar phenomenon
known as a Hypnagogic Jerk. That's a fancy

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.200
name for what occurs when you're about to
fall asleep and then all of the sudden you

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.130
feel like you're falling, or that you tripped,
and your body jolts itself awake.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.390
What's going on there is that as you fall
asleep your muscles relax, and some part of

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.680
your brain that's still awake notices that,
and feels like you're no longer supported -

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.500
you must be falling - and it sends out a huge
signal that causes all of your muscles to

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.480
twitch, waking you up.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.720
Oh, and déjà vu is not the only "vu" out there.
There's also something known as Presque vu,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.250
or "tip of the tongue," and this is what happens
when you're familiar with something, you know

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.270
you know it, but, for the life of you, at that
moment, you cannot recall it. It's like "what's

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.550
that actor's name from that movie? I've seen
it 18 times, how can I not remember it? Wow."

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.090
One explanation of how that happens is that
other words similar to the target word are

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.730
being remembered, and to help you out your
brain is actively blocking other stuff around

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.500
it, including the word you're actually looking
for. Now, this explanation is really nice

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.820
'cause it might actually explain why Presque
vu has a shared or social aspect. Even a

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.910
bunch of people in a group, all with separate
brains, if they're given the same "blocking

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.590
words" that are related, no one in the group
can come up with the name until the subject

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.090
is changed and those words are no longer blocked,
and then all the sudden someone goes "Oh,

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.120
Gary Sinise, that's who it was. Yup, there
you go."

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.180
Ok, finally, Jamais vu. This is when something
that you know, something that you're familiar

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:23.000
with, all of a sudden seems brand new and bizarre.
Schizophrenic patients will sometimes see

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.230
people they know and insist that it's not
the person they know. Instead, it's an imposter.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.520
But all of us have probably experienced Jamais
vu to a certain extent, for instance, when

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:38.920
you repeat a word over, and over, and over,
and over again, the word starts to lose its

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.140
meaning and you start to think "What? How
is this even a word? It's so weird!" Well,

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.060
scientists believe that happens because continuing
to excite the neurons responsible for that

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.290
word causes them to become inhibited, and
further use is less intense.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.050
It is just crazy to think that there is so
much out there in the world, in the universe,

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.500
that we don't know, that we don't understand,
that we haven't yet discovered. But yet

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:08.700
that very feeling of familiarity for what
we do know can't always be trusted. About

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.560
the only constant seems to be:

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.520
As always,

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.520
thanks for watching.
