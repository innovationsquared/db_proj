Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And today we are going to talk about color.

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.959
(Green Green, Green Green).
"Gold" on, let me just "Pink" this up.

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:10.690
"Yellow?"

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.849
"Michael, "Orange" you going to come to the
concert this evening?"

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.530
"I "Red" about that, there are going to be
a lot of "Purple" there."

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.670
"I didn't "Teal" you about this earlier?"

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.460
"Well, look, I have to go "Brown" town first,
but I'll be "White Black."

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.640
Colors...

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.480
Did you know that the human eye can differentiate
10 million different colors? But what color

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.200
is a mirror?

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.040
You might say "silver," because mirrors are
often illustrated that way, and, to be sure,

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.910
they are made out of silver or silvery things
like aluminium. But a mirror, in reality, is

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.070
whatever color you point it at.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.180
In this Green Room, the mirror is green. And
if you look inside a mirror, it becomes "you-colored."

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.040
An object is whatever color it doesn't absorb.
These sticky notes are orange because when

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.080
hit with typical white light, they absorb
every other wavelength of visible light, except

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.010
for orange, which they diffuse into your eye balls.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.030
But a perfect mirror reflects all colors equally.
So, in a way, you could say that a mirror

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.170
is white, except a mirror doesn't reflect
colors in the same way that pigment does.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:30.440
A mirror reflects incoming light in a single
outgoing direction - specular reflection, not

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.250
diffuse. This kind of reflection creates an
image of the very thing in front of the mirror.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.820
So, as Bad Astronomy jokes,
a mirror is more of a "smart white."

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.220
But wait a second, that is a "perfect" mirror
and we live in the real world where there

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.380
are no perfect mirrors. Every mirror absorbs
a little bit of light, not enough that it

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.659
matters, I mean, it looks pretty clear to
me, but when you take a look at the spectrum

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.580
of light reflected by a typical mirror, you
will find that it best reflects light within

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:10.560
the 510 nanometer range, which we perceive
as green light. So, technically, a mirror

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.940
is a tiny, tiny, tiny bit green.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.540
You may have noticed this yourself
when investigating a "Mirror Tunnel."

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.880
This happens when two mirrors face each other,
reflecting the same scene back and forth,

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:28.349
and back and forth, and back and forth. With
each new reflection, a little bit more visual

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:34.879
light is lost, but green least of all. That's
why the reflection way down the tunnel is

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.899
dimmer and greener.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.779
So maybe real world mirrors aren't "smart
white," they're actually kind of green, but

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:45.139
we should talk about white.

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.939
"En español, "white" es "blanco."

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.310
"En français, "white" est dit "blanc."

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.409
And in English we have a word that comes
from the same route. Black, which is the opposite

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.969
of white. How did that happen?

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:05.730
Well, it turns out that all of those words
come from the same ancient Proto-Indo-European

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:13.770
root word "Bhleg," which meant "shine," "burn,"
"flash." Some languages took it to mean the

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:20.320
brightness of the flash: "white." While others
took it to mean what's left behind: the burned,

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.069
"black," darkness.

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.789
If you have blue eyes, your eyes aren't actually
blue, in the sense that the molecules inside

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:32.629
them are absorbing all other wavelengths of
visible light and diffusing the blue. No,

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:39.880
no, no, instead, your eyes are blue for the
same reason that the sky is blue: interference.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.980
In our sky, light from the Sun encounters
molecules of air and because of the size

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:51.069
of those molecules, light of longer wavelengths
can slip on by, but shorter wavelengths crash

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.149
into the particles, like blue light, and scatter,
which is why we see blue when we look at the

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:58.349
sky away from the Sun.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.700
Without the air molecules, that space would
just be black. And when direct sunlight has

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.499
to travel through a lot of air, almost all
of the colors get scattered out except for

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:16.039
the longest wavelengths, the red, which is
what gives a sunrise and a sunset their color.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.220
The iris of your eyeball contains a hazy layer
where light can be scattered just like the

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.830
sky. Through a similar, but slightly different
process, shorter wavelengths are scattered

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.870
more, making your eyes look blue, unless,
of course, you have some melonen in that iris,

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.330
in which case your eyes are going to be
green, hazel or brown.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.460
Enjoy those colors.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.000
And as always,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.240
thanks for watching.
