00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.960
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And today we're going to talk about the science

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.970
of the friend zone.
You know, the experience

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.380
of liking someone and then finding out
that they would rather just be friends

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.640
with you.
Why does it happen? If there's

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.320
hope of escaping the friend zone, how can it be done?

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.230
And, more importantly, should you?

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.470
The term "friend zone" was popularized by the TV show

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.800
Friends on November 3, 1994.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.579
In Episode 7 of the first season,

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.820
Joey tells Ross that Rachel likes him,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.120
but will never like like him.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.649
Ross is in the friend zone.
Now, of course,

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.140
everything turned out fine for Ross,
but we're getting ahead of ourselves.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.570
Back when I calculated how much money love is worth

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.390
I discussed the feeling of having a crush on someone.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.579
Those emotions, the nervousness,
the excitement have a name.

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.680
What you feel when you have a crush on
somebody is known

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.650
as limerence. It's exciting to feel
butterflies in your stomach whenever

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.939
you're around somebody

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.030
and those butterflies may be caused by the release

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.049
of adrenaline, which pulls blood away
from things like your stomach

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.520
and toward the muscles,
where it may be better used. Of course,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.110
this can cause the stomach to shut down
a bit, become upset.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.380
It may also explain why people have a reduced appetite

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.770
when they feel love sick.
Now, whether you are

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.840
male, female, gay, straight,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.079
everybody can be friend-zoned.
And, biologically speaking,

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.850
the route of the friend zone may be

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.759
Bateman's Principle.
Named after

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.570
Angus Bateman, the principle states that
whenever a species,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.970
like us humans, contains two different sexes,

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.610
each with dissimilar sex cells, for instance,

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.600
sperm and egg, inevitably one sex will
have to commit more resources to the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.369
production

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.739
of offspring.
In mammals this is especially true.

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.800
A female can have only a limited number of offspring,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.870
whereas a male can have a virtually

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.700
unlimited number.
This causes a biological tendency for

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.129
one sex to be competitive and for the other

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.230
to be choosy.
The newest episode of

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.599
Earth Touch's "Wild Sex" goes into a lot
more detail about this,

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.680
so be sure to check it out.
But today,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.190
regardless of whether or not
reproduction is the goal,

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.260
the roles of pursuer and pursued

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.840
have extended beyond the Bateman
principle and are now quite

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.470
hard-wired into our culture.
Because not every pursuer can win

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.930
and because not every pursuer is a terrible jerk,

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.200
some friend-zoning in is inevitable.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.050
It's disappointing when it happens to
you and it's easy to rely on the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.739
"nice guys finish last" excuse,

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.220
but so far research hasn't found much

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.569
evidence for it.
What's more likely is that you have

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.080
idealized the other person as a potential mate,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.360
but a neutral observer could tell you that in reality

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.000
the two of you don't have as much
in common as you think.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.069
This is the argument put forward by Jenna Marbles

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.709
in her fantastic video.
It's called homogamy.

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.700
We select our mates based on how similar
they are to our own personalities,

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.489
interests and ideals for the future.
And so when someone is

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.049
friend-zoned, it's often not because they
were too friendly or too much of a nice

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:45.930
guy,

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.299
instead, it's often just run-of-the-mill incompatibility.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.520
But let's not rule out being

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.349
too friendly or too nice from every situation just yet.

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.530
Marshall Fine described the friend zone
as a penalty box that you're sent to

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.530
when your only crime is not being

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.650
buff or unobtainable enough.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.599
Buffness falls into homogamy. It's about
what someone else's interests are and

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:14.989
what they want from a mate.

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.329
But what fascinates me is the part about being

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.970
unobtainable.
Why would being available

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.440
and present and friendly make you less attractive?

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.850
And why would being kind of a jerk, too cool,

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.870
aloof or hard to get make you

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.650
more attractive?
Well, Robert Cialdini calls this

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.870
the scarcity principle.
We desire things that are difficult to obtain,

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.290
because we don't like to have our freedom limited

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.500
and we act before it can be.
This happens all the time in business

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.900
and it's equally true when it comes to attraction.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.050
Using the scarcity effect yourself

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.620
is often cited as a possible escape route
from the friend zone.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.250
Make yourself less available and see if your crush

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.560
responds, or try using

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.470
the Ben Franklin effect.
Benjamin Franklin wrote about how he was able to

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.199
form

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.280
relationships with other people by asking

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.009
them to do things for him.

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:24.009
The theory is that by doing favors for
you cognitive dissonance occurs in the

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:25.320
person's mind.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.630
Why would they be doing favors for you unless they

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.509
liked you? Now, it's no guarantee
that you'll become more than friends but just

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:34.030
by simply becoming

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.930
friends, you'll be doing something quite special,

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.919
because today, we all, on average have

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.710
fewer friends, fewer close individuals we can confide in

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.560
than we did decades ago.
And we hang out with those friends less

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.120
than we did before. This phenomenon was
explored famously by Robert Putnam

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.360
in "Bowling Alone."
For instance, from 1965 to 1995,

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.319
the number of minutes people of all ages
reported spending per day

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:07.810
with informal socializing, hanging out with friends,

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.270
going to parties, hanging out at bars or
having informal conversations

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.440
fell from 85 minutes

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.000
to just 57.
In about the same time frame,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.910
the number of picnics held fell 60 percent.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.410
And the number of times on average we
entertain friends at home

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.410
fell from 14 to 15 times a year

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.870
to a mere 8.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.919
We spend more time than we used to on entertainment,

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:39.060
sleep, exercise and transportation.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.060
Not bad things, but since the middle of the 20th century,

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.440
the two activities that many of us still
do that have decreased the most

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.780
are attending worship service and hanging out

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.139
with friends.
We're also now spending time on this new thing

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:59.830
called the Internet. It's a great tool for
communication and social networks,

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.610
but like T. S. Eliot said of the telephone before it,

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.979
the Internet may simply allow us
to speak to more people

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:10.810
than ever before, but be more lonely

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.610
doing it.
Social networks have somewhat diluted

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.910
the power of the word friend.
But way before MySpace or Facebook,

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:23.400
the word friend was on the way out.
So much so that we had to start using a new

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.620
word,

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.250
'best friend.'
Robert Wuthnow cautions that

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.710
on the Internet what feels social

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:35.069
may be less of a way for us to focus on actual

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:38.630
interpersonal relationships, and instead more of a

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.729
stage for us to focus on ourselves

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:46.310
in the presence of other people.
To be sure,

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.330
virtual communities are often more equal,

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.349
because we know less information about
our discussion partners, like age,

00:07:53.349 --> 00:07:56.430
race or gender.
But what we gain from

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.680
anonymity often comes at the cost of an

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.419
evening out of interests and values.

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:06.460
I can retreat from real-world conversations

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.530
and hide within niche communities online,
where everyone

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.979
thinks like me and generally shares my worldview.

00:08:13.979 --> 00:08:17.060
It's called cyberbalkanization.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.240
It's when online interactions provide a lazy

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.050
environment, free from actual discussion
and outside views.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:29.750
Whereas the real world often forces us
to deal with the greater diversity

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:34.620
of interests and values.
Now, because we choose mates that are

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.490
so similar to ourselves, this vital exposure to new,

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.640
honest ideas often has to come from

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.990
friends - a resource that is diminishing

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.750
in our society.
And so, although it's disappointing

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.980
to be friend-zoned, in a way it might be

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.820
where that other person, and all of us,

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.940
actually need you the most.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.040
And as always,

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:00.800
thanks for watching.
