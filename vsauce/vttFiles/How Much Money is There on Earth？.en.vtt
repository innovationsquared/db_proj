00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.449
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
On Earth

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.850
the average piece of currency changes hands

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.910
about 55 times a year.
That's about once a week.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.549
With that kind of turnover,
it's safe to say that statistically

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.199
in the United States out of every 100
pieces of currency

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.060
one was most likely touched in the last year

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.680
by someone who within the next year will
commit murder.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.710
But how much cash,

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.230
how much physical currency is there on

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.600
earth?

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.640
First things first, how much cash

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.280
is inside of bank?
Well, according to the FBI,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.860
the average successful bank robbery
involves 10,000 dollars.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.460
But that's usually just currency from the tellers

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.960
tills. In their vaults, the average bank
might have anywhere from 10,000

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.899
dollars

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.600
to a 100,000 dollars with some
larger banks at times

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.659
carrying as much as a few million in cash.

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.070
But what about in our homes?
How much loose change do we all have scattered on

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.810
dressers

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.360
or lost under cushions?
Well, it's tough to

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.009
accurately figure out the exact number
and many of the estimates vary.

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.090
Last year, Lloyds TSB announced that in the UK

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.420
the average person has about £14.15 just

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.100
lying around. A recent survey by VISA
looked at a bunch of countries

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.369
and included cash left at home, the office,

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.969
and in the car.
Their figures are a tad higher,

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.719
but agree with the US Treasury's
estimate of few years ago

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:49.090
that the typical US household has ninety

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.820
to a hundred dollars just laying around,

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.329
which means that if just everyone in
America scrounged up all of their loose

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.110
change

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.469
and put in one place, they would have 15

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.070
billion dollars.
That's enough to fund

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.729
357 more seasons of Arrested Development.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.019
But we are asking about how much cash

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.870
there is on the entire planet.
Well, that amount has a special name.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.890
It is called M0.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.220
It's an aggregate of all coins and banknotes.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.299
DollarDays.org's most recent estimate

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.320
values this total amount, considering all
currencies in countries,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.709
at just slightly over the equivalent of 5

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.160
trillion US dollars.
That number,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.230
the value of all of the currency on Earth,

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.409
M0, is huge.
But believe it or not,

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.560
it represents less than 10 percent

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.870
of all of the money we humans have  available to spend

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.519
right away.
To explain, we should look at how

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.620
money is born.
In pretty much every country on Earth,

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.050
one of the ways new money can be born involves

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.340
a central bank. Now, let's say that in our
country the bank is run

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.790
by Jake from Vsauce3.
He's really smart

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.209
and he pays close attention to our economy.
If he feels

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.260
that an increase of the
money supply would help us, well,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.290
he can just make more money.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.180
It's that easy.
It doesn't need to be printed as currency

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.349
to be born.
The next step involves the commercial banks,

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.000
like the Bank of Vsauce.
These are the banks that you and I use.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.489
All the central bank needs to do is buy
some things from these banks using the

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.650
money it just made

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.610
and now the commercial banks have more
money. There's another way money can be

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.290
born.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.500
It involves commercial banks and gets to
the heart of our question.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.230
If I go to the bank and deposit 5 pounds,

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.810
the bank says fantastic, 
we will hold on to this money for you

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.090
and at anytime you want,
you can withdraw or spend

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.510
these 5 pounds.
The thing is, legally,

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.700
banks only need to reserve a fraction

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.470
of the money that they are given.
It is known as fractional reserve banking

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.120
and it pretty much happens in every country.
It means

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.950
that if someone else comes along,
like, say, Kevin from Vsauce2

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.380
and he wants to borrow some money,
say, 3 pounds,

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.760
the bank can lend him 3 pounds.
And now, whenever he wants he can

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.349
spend these 3 pounds.
But here's the thing:

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.890
Kevin can spend 3 pounds and I can spend 5

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.200
for a total of 8, despite the fact that
there are only 5 pounds

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.159
in the bank.
New money has been born.

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:46.570
And if we want to count all of the
spendable money

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.419
on Earth, we're going to need to include
this type of money, the kind that

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.479
fractional reserve banking

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.900
creates.
If we include that kind of money,

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.160
we are now talking about a number much larger than

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.419
M0. Economists call this figure

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.729
M1.
M1 includes all

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.850
physical currencies, as well as money
that people can access quickly,

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.940
like money in checking accounts.
Globally,

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.410
across all countries and all currencies, M1 is

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.710
estimated to be the equivalent of 25

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.690
trillion US dollars.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.580
M2 is an even broader definition of money

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.419
and it includes things that you can't
necessarily spend right away.

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.630
For instance, savings accounts or CDs

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.199
under a hundred thousand dollars.
M2, globally,

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.259
is currently estimated to be the
equivalent of 60

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:44.560
trillion US dollars.
Finally,

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.500
M3.
This is a broad definition of money that includes

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.860
all currencies, banknotes and coins,
checking accounts,

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.110
savings accounts, small CDs and really
big, long time deposits.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.880
In the American economy, the Federal
Reserve doesn't even report this figure

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.539
anymore,

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:05.819
but as a measure of eventually
spendable wealth it's real

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:09.160
and if we consider M3 the global money supply

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.350
that gives us a figure that is equivalent

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.380
to 75 trillion

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.389
US dollars.
Of all that money,

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:23.150
how much of it is yours?
Well, last week

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.669
over Twitter, Mark Boadey introduced me to
Global Rich List

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:31.470
dot com.
Enter your salary and figure out how you stack up

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.849
against everyone else on Earth.

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:38.710
By the way, you can act just like a central bank

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.080
and control the money supply yourself.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.919
It is illegal, but you can technically
increase the money supply

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:50.470
by counterfeiting and you can decrease
the money supply

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.759
by subtracting money.
For instance,

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:58.300
burning it.
If you burn your own money,

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.509
you become poorer, but because you've
decrease the money supply,

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:07.650
the power of everyone else's money goes up
and they become a tiny tiny bit

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.800
richer.
Of course, given the amount of money

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.669
on Earth and the amount that you could
probably get your hands on and burn,

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:18.470
your effect will be quite imperceptible.

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.240
One the largest amounts of cash ever
burned was done by KLF,

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.220
who in the nineties for reasons

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:29.090
no one's still quite sure of, burned a million

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.849
pounds worth of cash.
It took them about

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:37.069
2 hours to burn all of that cash and
they recorded the act

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:40.090
on video.
You can also destroy money

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.639
by eating it, like the rapper Tyga did.
But

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:47.220
you probably shouldn't do that either
because money

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:52.810
is dirty. A study published in Applied
and Environmental Microbiology

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.729
reported that the flu virus can survive on cash

00:07:56.729 --> 00:08:00.210
for 1 hour to 2 days.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.690
And other studies have found that about
7 percent of cash

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:07.009
carries viable strains of dangerous bacteria,

00:08:07.009 --> 00:08:10.580
like those the cause pneumonia or those
that come from

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.900
feces.
That is a lot

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:18.180
of germs and those germs might be high.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:22.020
Studies have found that 92 percent of banknotes

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.729
are contaminated with traces of illegal drugs, typically

00:08:25.729 --> 00:08:31.000
cocaine.
In London that number has been as high as 99 percent.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.010
All it takes is for a few exposed

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.550
bank notes to circulate normally for all of the cash

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:42.390
to become contaminated.
Locked within the fibres of a banknote,

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:45.900
there's an average of 28 micrograms

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.020
of cocaine, which means that in 5,000 banknotes,

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.160
there's enough cocaine for an entire

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:59.630
line. These drug traces are nearly
impossible to remove from bank notes,

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:03.610
so there's little risk of the drugs
transferring to your skin.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:07.410
However, they can be detected by drug sniffing dogs

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.569
and, on more than one occasion, courts
have forced police to return confiscated

00:09:11.569 --> 00:09:12.750
cash,

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.829
because even though drug dogs detected
drugs on the cash,

00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:20.040
that's just how cash is.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.110
As if that wasn't enough, cash is

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.980
also not nutritious.
Termites can eat cash,

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.640
but to us humans,
the ones who love this stuff so much,

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.569
cash as we know it today and, for that matter, money

00:09:34.569 --> 00:09:38.569
doesn't really have any intrinsic value.

00:09:38.569 --> 00:09:41.959
In a post-apocalyptic world, where nothing was stable

00:09:41.959 --> 00:09:45.130
and survival was a challenge, food,

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:49.280
clean, water, AMO, weapons, antibiotics, machines,

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.910
fuel, the trade and exchange and gifting

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:56.540
of those types of things would be our economy.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:01.160
When what you use as money has an
intrinsic value, it's useful

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.459
in and of itself, it is known as commodity money.

00:10:05.459 --> 00:10:08.530
It can also include precious metals, like gold,

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:12.270
whose rarity makes it likely to be
accepted by other people

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:17.420
for goods and services. Now, when you can
safely store all of your commodities in

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.140
one place

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.900
and you don't need a defend them
or lug them around everywhere,

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.900
representative money often makes more sense.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:29.459
Store your valuables in a trusted place like a bank

00:10:29.459 --> 00:10:32.530
and get some slips of paper from them, saying "yeah, I

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:37.610
own that stuff." Now you can walk around
with some easy to carry slips of paper

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.790
and use those to buy the things that you want.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:44.429
We are now closer to what we call money today.

00:10:44.429 --> 00:10:49.780
I say closer, because almost all money
that we know of today

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.140
doesn't represent any actual useful commodity

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:58.689
anywhere on Earth. This note doesn't
represent how much food or water or gold

00:10:58.689 --> 00:11:02.329
or spices or video games I have stocked up in a bank,

00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:05.689
it just is money.

00:11:05.689 --> 00:11:10.059
It's called fiat money.
Fiat is Latin for "let

00:11:10.059 --> 00:11:14.260
it be done."
And that kind of authoritative command is exactly what

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.699
gives fiat money

00:11:15.699 --> 00:11:18.990
its value.
The people who make it have decreed

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.549
that it is valuable. Why?

00:11:22.549 --> 00:11:26.140
Just let it be done.
Because of this,

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:30.030
the value a fiat money depends on
everyone believing

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:34.350
that the people who make it will
continue to exist and have the authority

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:38.579
that they already do.
This means that the value of fiat money,

00:11:38.579 --> 00:11:41.809
unlike other commodities, can be erased

00:11:41.809 --> 00:11:46.530
by force. Let's imagine that you live in
America and have a lot of dollars.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:50.100
Great job.
Well, technically, Canada

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:55.120
could invade and declare that the US
dollar will no longer be accepted

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.380
at all.
Well,

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:02.740
shucks.
You now have a bunch of paper, which at best

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:06.339
is a incomplete deck of famous American

00:12:06.339 --> 00:12:10.030
flashcards.
The important distinction here

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:13.339
is that invading Canadians could technically

00:12:13.339 --> 00:12:16.540
erase the value of fiat money.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:20.160
But nothing they said or did could make a commodity,

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:25.709
like gold, less valuable.
Other countries would still be glad to take your gold

00:12:25.709 --> 00:12:28.770
and in return give you their own, still valuable,

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.819
currencies.
No amount of force

00:12:31.819 --> 00:12:36.880
or authority or laws or rules can make a
commodity like potable water

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.160
any less important to drink or gold

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.049
any less rare.
On the other hand, the value of

00:12:44.049 --> 00:12:47.520
fiat money depends on our beliefs,

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.980
what we think.
So long as we all believe

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.870
that fiat money is valuable, it is.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:58.480
This happens all the time.
What we believe,

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.709
what we think we know, can actually
cause those things

00:13:02.709 --> 00:13:06.089
to become true.
Actual people, real

00:13:06.089 --> 00:13:09.209
objects, the way the universe works and deities,

00:13:09.209 --> 00:13:14.230
like Zeus, can exist all by themselves,
whether we know about them

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.439
or believe in them.
But some concepts

00:13:17.439 --> 00:13:21.549
require us to believe in them
for them to be real.

00:13:21.549 --> 00:13:24.880
And if no one believes in them, they literally

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.400
aren't true.
It's called the Tinkerbell

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:33.079
effect, and the value of fiat money is an
often-cited example.

00:13:33.079 --> 00:13:37.059
But what's really cool is the fact that
there are situations where

00:13:37.059 --> 00:13:40.699
our convictions can actually destroye

00:13:40.699 --> 00:13:44.069
the very thing we believe in.
It's called

00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:48.400
the reverse Tinkerbell effect
and it describes the situation,

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.429
whereas more people believe something that

00:13:51.429 --> 00:13:54.770
thing actually becomes less and less

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:59.780
true.
For example, the idea that driving a car

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:03.429
is safe.
As more and more people believe this,

00:14:03.429 --> 00:14:08.959
more people will go out driving and they
are likely to drive less cautiously,

00:14:08.959 --> 00:14:12.459
ironically making driving less

00:14:12.459 --> 00:14:15.470
safe.
Another example would be the idea that

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:20.510
in an election your vote matters.
As more and more people believe this, more people

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:21.780
will go out and vote

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:27.160
and the individual weight of each vote will go down.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.400
It took hard work and tools

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:35.939
to build civilization and find cures
and explore our solar system,

00:14:35.939 --> 00:14:39.760
but we should keep in mind that without
doing anything at all

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.959
we are still capable of creation.

00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:46.589
By merely believing in something we can make it

00:14:46.589 --> 00:14:50.290
actually truly real.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.809
Other things can actually be destroyed,

00:14:53.809 --> 00:14:57.020
if we merely believe in them.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.120
Can you believe that?

00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.460
And as always,

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.040
thanks for watching.
