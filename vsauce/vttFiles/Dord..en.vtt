00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.700
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.839
In 1934 Webster's dictionary gave birth to a new word

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:11.410
by mistake. Their chemistry editor

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.309
Austin N Paterson submitted a simple entry: "D 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.390
or D abbreviation for density".

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.490
Nothing wrong with that, but the entry was misread

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.800
and 'dord' was added to the dictionary.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.560
'Dord' was an accidental word for
thirteen years before the mistake was

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.359
discovered

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.399
and its wordship revoked. Let's have fun
with words today,

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.550
but first, what's the deal with first?

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.950
Or for that matter, second? If you were in
position three

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.860
you're in third place. Position 5, fifth.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.180
Position 197

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.260
one hundred and ninety-seventh. Pretty simple.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.730
So why do positions 1 and 2 give us first and second?

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.890
Shouldn't they be 'oneth' and 'twoth'?

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.030
Well, maybe. But English loves

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.080
collateral adjectives. Adjectives derived
from different roots than the nouns

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.090
they describe. There are plenty of
derived adjectives, don't get me wrong.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.140
A bunch of clouds

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.520
make the day cloudy, friends are friendly,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.250
poets are poetic. Things with a lot of
smell to them are smelly

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.780
but the Moon is not Moonly.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.060
The Moon is lunar.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.740
Collateral adjectives are everywhere.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.660
Mouth stuff is oral. Bees are apian.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.740
Some nouns have both. Fathers can be

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.250
fatherly or paternal .

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.420
And a setting filled with fog can be foggy or brumous.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.479
It's often said that no word

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.140
rhymes with orange. Is that true?

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.240
Well, rhyming can be controversial because
it often depends on pronunciation,

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.259
accent and can be forced. Especially if
you use multiple

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.009
words, you can force orange to rhyme with
door hinge,

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.910
if you want. But what we want is a perfect rhyme.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.430
A perfect rhyme is what occurs between
two words

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.910
like tickle and pickle. They are perfect
rhymes because the final stressed

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.230
vowel sound and all the sounds
afterwards are identical.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.260
Identical doesn't rhyme with pickle,
because even though they both

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.260
end with 'ickle', identical has it stress
in the wrong place.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.900
We could rhyme them if we pronounced it
not identical

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.650
but instead identical. With that in mind,

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.250
orange does have perfect rhymes. They
just happen to be extremely obscure,

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.250
like 'Blorenge', a hill in Wales.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.360
Silver also has a perfect rhyme: chilver, a female lamb.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.319
Think Fact delineated even more words we
often say don't have rhymes but

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.069
actually do. Point is, orange does have

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.390
perfect rhymes, and even if it didn't, well,

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.409
that wouldn't make it special. Sure, monosyllabic words

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.840
tend to rhyme with other words. It's believed
there are only about 100 single syllable

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.220
words that have no rhyme.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.000
For instance, wolf, sixth, depth and filmed.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.340
But considering words of all lengths,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.450
it's been calculated that most English words

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.090
don't rhyme with anything. Don't believe me?

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.440
Well, leave a comment below. The word
'comment'

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.750
rhymes with nothing, nor does husband, sandwich,

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.739
liquid, penguin, chimney, empty,

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.230
and, of course, 'nothing' rhymes with nothing.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.030
Identical rhymes are even more perfect

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.180
than perfect rhymes but they become so
identical at that point

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.819
it's a little obvious and not really
appreciated.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.000
Identical rhymes occur when the consonant
sound before the final stressed vowel

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.220
between two words are also identical.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.180
Sun and gun are perfect rhymes. But gun

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.580
and begun are identical rhymes. So are

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.599
offend and defend, or homonyms like

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:19.049
son and sun. You could call the people
who watch over, and monitor, the police

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.660
'the police police'. Who watches over them? Well,

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.509
'the police police police', of course. You can
string together

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:30.240
any number of police's and always create
a sensible,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.470
though clunky, title. You can even use

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.830
the word police by itself to create a
grammatical sentence. It takes

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.680
eight of them. Police police police police police police police

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.509
police. Here's what the sentence
means. Police police,

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:49.180
which police police police watch over,
police police.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.400
Add any multiple of three more police to
this stream

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.919
and you preserve the grammar. The most
that fit on Twitter

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.630
is 20. If you say police enough times
it starts to sound like its not even a

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.680
real word.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.360
That is called jamais vu, the reverse of deja vu,

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.690
when something familiar all of a sudden
feels new

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.090
and novel. I've covered it before but
let's be clear.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.370
If you don't practice obediency to the police

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.650
you may wind up in J L. Escape, and you're an SKP.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.830
Letters, whose names said together some
similar to words,

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.860
are called Gramograms. You can't hear

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.479
a pterodactyl urinate because it's
silent 'p'.

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.509
But every letter in the alphabet is
silent sometimes.

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:37.259
And some letters are used more
frequently than other letters

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:41.759
in English words. Scrabble provides more
of those letters and people guess them more

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.900
often when playing hangman. Next time you play hangman you can take advantage of this.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.889
People will guess more letters
incorrectly if you choose a short word

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:54.680
that has few different letters. John McLuhan

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.940
ran 15 million computer simulations of
hangman

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.270
and he found that the most difficult word for
people to guess

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.370
is jazz.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.280
Phantonyms aren't ghostly undead words, they're words
that appear to mean one thing but

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.040
actually mean something completely different.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.740
Enervate sounds like it means to fill with energy but it actually means to

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.320
drain of energy, to weaken.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.520
Noisome appears to mean really noisy but it actually describes something that has an

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.420
extremely offensive smell.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.960
In 2005, the New Oxford American Dictionary
published a new word:

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.840
esquivalience.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.840
They said it meant the wilful avoidance of
one's official responsibilities.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.580
But it didn't. They made it up

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.820
as a copyright trap. If anyone copied
their dictionary

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.400
the stealer wouldn't be able to explain
how esquivalience wound up in their dictionary

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.070
without admitting that they had copied it. Map makers often insert fake

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.100
features for the same purposes. Streets and
towns that only exist

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.250
to trap copiers that only exist on paper,

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:09.570
Paper Streets &amp; Paper Towns. The author of
The Trivia encyclopedia even placed a fake fact

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.650
in one of his books because he
was certain

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.820
that the Trivial Pursuit board game was
taking their questions

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.840
from his book. Sure enough, later the
board game included his fake fact

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.920
as a real question. Similarly, the esquivalinece trap was used to catch

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.800
Dictionary.com.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.020
But here's the thing: authorities don't
tend to respect copyright traps

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.760
built out of fake facts.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.640
Facts cannot be copyrighted. They belong to, and can be used by,

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.740
all of us. US federal courts have argued that

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.860
fake facts presented as real are not
protected, because if they were,

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.670
no one could share real true information
without fear

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.780
of sharing something protected by copyright. That said,

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.860
stylistic decisions like how the facts
are selected or arranged or articulated

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:03.060
can be copyrighted. When the automobile
association was caught mimicking

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.080
the stylistic features of ordnance
surveys, they were forced to pay up

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.680
twenty million pounds.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.750
You cannot own a fact

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.800
and you cannot own a lie you made up, if
everyone believes it.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.880
But you can own how you tell them.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.740
Puns are great, and in 'The Pun Also Rises'

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.590
John Pollock relates a fantastic story.
Puns can be traced

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:29.590
all the way back to be epic of Gilgamesh,
where people are warned

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:34.370
of an upcoming giant flood. They are
told that the skies will soon rain

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.760
kibtu and kukku. Words that mean

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.080
corn and the sound corn makes when
falling on the ground.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.169
But in the story, the words are actually
puns

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:48.220
on words for misery and suffering.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.600
People who got the pun prepared and
saved their own lives,

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.940
but those who failed to recognise the pun
perished in the flood,

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.120
which means the very oldest pun on record

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:05.000
was literally corny. Is that ironic?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.270
No. Irony is one of the most

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:12.680
debated figures of speech. The Oatmeal[.com]
famously lamented that if anyone refers

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.460
to anything as being

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:20.400
ironic, the hip thing to do right now is
to call it out as being not ironic.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.890
Situational irony is what we
tend to mean when we say something is ironic.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:30.460
The Oatmeal defines it as "when something
happens and a reversal of expectations occurs".

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.850
Dig.com's recent article on the
subject uses an even stricter definition,

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.150
saying "situational irony is a direct
result of an

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.650
action intended to produce the opposite effect".

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.980
Their example is really good. If the elevators

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.470
at in elevator repair school are out of order,

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.880
that's not really situational irony.
Instead,

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.990
what would be really ironic is that if the
elevators were out of order because the

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.620
experts at the school had done something to them

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.420
they believed would make them run forever
and never be

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.980
out of order. Alanis Morissette wrote a
song called

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.150
'Ironic', whose lyrics contain situations but

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.370
famously no situational irony.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.630
People love pointing this out.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:18.760
"A traffic jam when you're already late."
Not situational irony,

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:23.350
that's just a bummer or a sad
coincidence. Patrick Cassels cleverly

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:26.910
rewrote the song's lyrics to contain
situations that are actually

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.680
situationally ironic. For example, a traffic jam

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.230
when you're already late to receive an
award from the municipal planning board

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.290
for reducing the city's automobile
congestion

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.140
eighty percent, or a black fly in your
chardonnay

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:45.560
poured to celebrate the successful fumigation of your recently purchased vineyard in southern France.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.040
Now that's what I call situational irony.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:51.730
But regardless of what Alanis intended,

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:55.140
a close reading of the song's lyrics
reveals that irony

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:59.370
is occurring, just not the situational
kind it's hip to argue about.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:03.380
Instead, her song is all about dramatic irony.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.680
When someone is, often hilariously,

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:10.180
unaware of the significance of an event,
while other people are.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:14.420
Take a look at the lyrics for 'Ironic'.
The situations she describes are never

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.860
explicitly labeled

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:21.580
ironic. At the most, they're simply
stories and similes and metaphors for it:

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.580
life.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:25.500
And, she adds later, life is also

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:31.220
ironic. Dramatically ironic. These
things sound like cruddy scenarios, but they

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.650
actually figure, they actually make sense.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:38.640
Ironic is not a list of examples of
situational irony.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.080
Instead, it's a treatise on dramatic irony,

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.480
the difference between what life knows we need

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:48.200
and what we think we need.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:53.260
What's ironic isn't 10,000 spoons when
all you need is at knife. It's the fact that,

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:56.470
as Alanis believes, you have all of
those spoons,

00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:00.380
because unbeknownst to you, but known by life, what you really need right now

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:06.000
is only spoons. Or, the last thing you
need right now is a knife.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.840
On the subject of overanalysing pop songs,

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.690
analysis of dog mitochondrial DNA
has revealed that

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.790
all dogs may be traceable to a localised event.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:19.070
The species is believed to have resulted
from the domestication of

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:22.370
wolves about 11,000 to 16,000 years ago,

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:24.930
in what is now Southwestern China.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:30.040
So, Baha Men, to answer your question, it was the Mesolithic Southwestern Chinese

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:31.730
who let the dogs out.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.060
And as always,

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.900
thanks for watching
