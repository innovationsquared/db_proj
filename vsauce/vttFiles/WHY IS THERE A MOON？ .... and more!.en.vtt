00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:03.290
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And I'm Regent's Park

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.339
in London joined by Tom from "/Tom."

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:10.309
Awesome channel, check it out.
This camera belongs to Tom and Hazel

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.429
is operating it right now.
Yeah, that's her giving a thumbs up, which

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.619
I'm sure just look like a blur,
but the point is we're gonna do information today.

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.660
Right now, Tom, I'm in London.
Which is in England. And it's also in

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.820
the United Kingdom.
Which is in Europe. Okay, and we've also

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.310
got another term - Great Britain.
Well, let's unpack all these terms

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.330
and today learn about

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.000
geography.
I may have failed geography.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.040
Can I find someone else?

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.820
Now, if we're going to talk about
geography, I think we should go all the

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.140
way back to a time

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.230
when there was no geography. That's right.
Way before YouTube existed,

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.890
our solar system was nothing but a
mist of dust and gases,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.989
what is known as a solar nebula.
But then,

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.680
about 4.6 billion years ago something

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.210
majestic happened.
We don't know exactly what caused it,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.899
but some scientists believe that the
shockwave of a nearby supernova

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.299
hit our nebula, causing it to start spinning

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.119
and contracting. Now, as things collected
together, their overall gravity got

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.320
stronger and they pulled more stuff in it.
And boom,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.920
we've got a Sun.
A half billion years later,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.800
and the disk of junk circling around
the Sun starts coming together in its

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.410
own way,

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.060
into what we now call the planets.
One of these planets I've actually

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.750
visited and it's called Earth.
But before we get ahead of ourselves,

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.080
what the heck is the Moon doing there?
I mean, here's the problem. When you look at

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.840
all the terrestrial planets,
all the planets near us, near the Sun,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.580
they all have very similar structure and
they'll have the same big metal core

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.360
and they all have very similar densities.
But the Moon

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.759
is very not dense.
And it doesn't have

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.869
a similar structure, it doesn't have a huge
dense metal core.

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.899
In fact when we visited them and brought
back dust and rocks to analyze what the

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:56.979
Moon was made out of,

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.470
we found that the Moon was made out of
the same stuff that you find in

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.879
Earth's crust and mantle but not Earth's

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:07.649
core. This discovery gave rise to a
pretty awesome idea

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.220
that the moon is actually made out of
what used to be

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.250
on Earth.
About 4.52

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.770
billion years ago there used to be
another planet

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.150
called Theia. It was a little bit smaller
than Mars but it had an unfortunate

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.569
orbit. It was fine for millions of years
but eventually and

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.879
what did happen to it was that it
collided with Earth.

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.140
Now, it's believed that
the collision happened quite slowly

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.170
and the centers, the cores of both Theia and Earth

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.580
fused into one. And material from the
mantle and crust of Earth

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.800
wasn't just scattered
but it was forcefully ejected,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.230
literally launched into outer space.
It circled around

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.530
Earth and scientists believe that it took
only about a week

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.269
for all that Earth material out in space
to coalesce

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.780
into what we now call the Moon.
Oh, and by the way, if

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.109
that's how the Moon formed,
it was such a strong collision

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.709
the actual axis that the Earth spun on was tilted

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.120
23.5 degrees, which to this day

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.700
is why we have seasons.well

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.980
Wow.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.540
Alright, so four billion years ago the
continents as we know them

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.439
began to emerge. You know, these pieces of
the Earth's crust that have cooled down

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.159
and are floating around on Earth's molten
liquid insides.

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.760
Now, they move and they've been in
constant motion since they began but

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.469
they move

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:32.659
very, very slowly.
Every 300 to 500 million years,

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:36.029
the continents all converge into what's called one

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:40.019
big supercontinent.
All the land in the entire Earth

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.329
altogether and the rest of it covered in
ocean. The most recent supercontinent is

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:45.450
kind of a famous, it's called

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.840
Pangaea. But scientists believe that there
may have been four, five, six or even more

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.560
supercontinents that existed

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.790
before Pangaea.
What's really mind-blowing

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.810
is the fact that eventually there's
going to be another Pangaea, another supercontinent.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.239
And based on calculations,
the Earth at that time

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.810
will look like this. But like I said,
these land masses are moving very very

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.560
slowly

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.200
and so for that reason it is worth
learning their names

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.230
as they are now.
Which brings us back to the question of

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.590
England, United Kingdom, Great Britain,

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.780
British Isles and what all these terms mean.
Let's begin

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.389
zoomed out.
The British Isles and Ireland are a collection of

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.880
6 thousand islands off the coast of Europe.
The term

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.110
Great Britain refers to the largest
of these islands.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.570
Now, Great Britain contains three
separate countries: England,

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.870
Wales and Scotland.
If we add Northern Ireland into the mix,

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.930
we're now looking at what is known as
the United Kingdom or the

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.130
UK. The Republic of Ireland is a
separate country that is not part

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.500
of the United Kingdom. And, by the way,
England is where London is

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.110
which is where Summer in the City was.
Which brings us back to Regent's Park.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.230
And

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.410
as

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.449
always,

00:04:58.449 --> 00:04:59.289
thanks for

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:01.569
watching.

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:12.749
Could you guys stand still for a second?

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.960
To learn more about Great Britain,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.220
Ireland, overseas territories and even Canada,

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.300
you really must check out CGPGrey's

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.850
explanation video, if you haven't seen it already.
This guy's incredible.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.260
You can also check out the channels belonging to
the people who helped me with the intro

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.750
and outro for this video.
We've got Tom and

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.500
"Dude! Where's My Challenge?"
