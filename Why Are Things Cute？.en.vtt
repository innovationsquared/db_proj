Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And The Pet Collective offers 24-hour coverage

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.619
of puppies and kittens.
It's really cute.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:16.279
But what is cute, scientifically?
I mean, why do we like soft, cuddly things

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.390
and why do cute things have a unique effect on us?

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:28.570
Well, the word cute is a shortening of acute,
which originally meant "keen," "shrewd," "perceptive."

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.300
About 180 years ago, the word cute began to
be used as slang for a girl, who was pretty.

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.819
And after that, it accrued a new meaning and
was used to describe cuddly, delicate, quaint,

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:49.989
precious, youthful traits.
Konrad Lorenz studies cuteness in living things

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.609
and put together a great specific list of
what we consider cute.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:02.159
Small body size with a disproportionately
large head, large eyes and round and soft

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.000
body features.
But why exactly did these characteristics

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.920
elicit an "ooooohhh" response from us humans?
Well, Lorenz pointed that you could find all

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.000
of those characteristics in the human baby,
which makes sense.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.560
If merely looking at our offspring makes us
instinctively feel protective and nurturing,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.430
well, that's great for all of us.
A fun consequence of this is that our experience

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.230
of cuteness can be triggered by things that
aren't human babies.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:42.890
For instance, shells, bunnies, owls and even a hammer.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.640
A hammer, how can that be?
Take a look at this interactive tool from

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.650
the Exploratorium.
A hammer is boring.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:57.680
But if we apply Lorenz's traits and make it
really round and really squat, it goes from

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.210
a utilitarian tool to a cute little tiny hammer.
Oh, he's just a little hammer, don't hurt him.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.520
It is a hammer that has become cute, because

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.130
we gave it qualities that we see in our own offspring.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.380
As Daniel Dennett puts it, "if human babies
looked like this, instead of that, we would

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.090
find this cute."
And whenever we saw something that looked

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.190
like it, we would wanna cuddle and snuggle with it.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.980
Alright, so we have a pretty good idea about
the how and what of cute.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.430
But where is cute?
Well, researchers have shown cute baby pictures

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.860
to subjects while using functional MRI to
track activity in the brain.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.840
And sure enough, the cuter the baby in the
picture, the more activation found right here

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.709
- the nucleus accumbens.
A pleasure centre.

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.629
When activated, the nucleus accumbens releases dopamine.

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:00.260
It's all part of our internal reward system.
It's the same part of the brain targeted by

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.900
cocaine and meth.
Cuteness is such a powerful force on the brain

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.100
in fact that it can affect our behaviours
- what we like, what we buy.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.900
And so it's no coincidence that the creators
of cartoon characters, like Mickey Mouse or

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.090
Pikachu, have drawn them more
and more cute over time.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.900
The Japanese concept of Kawaii is a great
example of this and it's one that's fun to quantify.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.060
If you're an adult, how many of your own heads,

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.020
stacked on top of each other, do you think
it would take to equal your height?

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.900
The answer for most of us is around 7.5.
But illustrations of people that are meant

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:46.740
to make them look heroic or noble tend to
make the person around 8 to 8.5 heads high.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.739
Cute goes the other way.
Manga characters tend to only be about 5.5

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.719
to 6.5 heads tall.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.180
Back to babies.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.959
There are many other psychological factors
at work that cause us to want to instinctively

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.419
take care of our young.
And to be sure, some of them are decidedly

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.920
not cute.
For instance, poopy diapers.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.660
Researchers have found that mothers, when
exposed to soiled diapers, tend to consider

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:24.050
the smell coming from their own child's diaper
to be the least terrible, despite not knowing

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.830
which diaper belonged to which kid.
When something retains juvenile traits all

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:36.130
the way through adulthood, it is called neoteny.
And we love it, especially in animals that

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.090
we keep as pets.
Of course, us humans have selectively bred

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.169
all kinds of animals to make each generation
more and more useful to us.

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:53.970
But the dog may be the animal that've spent
the most time designing, making each generation

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:00.010
better at hunting or better at staying cuter for longer.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:07.900
Dogs like this have been designed by us to
look, grow and behave in ways that we want.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.800
Not that dissimilar from how we would design,
say, a DVD player and its features.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.449
So whether it's staying cute forever or just
being a really great hunting companion, the

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:25.370
modern dog, more than any other animal, could
be considered not so much a consequence of

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:34.060
nature as much as it is a piece of human technology.
As Science Friday puts it, "the dog is man's

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:41.740
best friend because it may be man's best invention."
So go pet a cute dog today.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.540
And as always,

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.900
thanks for watching.
