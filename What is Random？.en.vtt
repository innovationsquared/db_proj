00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.629
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here and Derek.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.480
Generate(!)

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.179
78? That's so random. Or is it?

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.209
What does it mean to be random?

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.029
Can anything really be random? 
What's the most random thing ever?

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.840
Today let's stop being random and become 'ransmart'.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.039
If something is unpredictable,

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.259
and contains no recognisable patterns, we
call it random.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.280
So let's begin our hunt for the most random thing with a coin toss.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.220
The Australian 50 cent coin is one of the largest coins

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.900
currently in circulation.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.600
Coin flips and rolling dice are not
intrinsically random,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.600
they are only random because of our

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.670
ignorance. If we could know every initial condition

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.870
the exact forces and properties that play
for a particular flip or roll,

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.000
we could theoretically calculate the result before it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.100
even happened. And, sure enough, researchers
have built coin flipping robots

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.780
that can precisely control a flip to get
the result they want

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.080
100 percent of the time.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.580
So here is our question. Is there anything you couldn't predict

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.860
even if you knew everything? A process determined

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.050
by nothing? And how can you be sure they're

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.150
aren't any patterns in what you're
looking at? Maybe you just haven't looked

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.500
for the right pattern yet.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.650
Or maybe you have already seen true
randomness

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.120
but didn't know it because you didn't
look for long enough.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.170
As if protected by a sort of camouflage,

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.820
a random process can, and will,
occasionally produce patterns.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.020
YouTube URLs are pretty much

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.510
random. A unique one is made for every
uploaded video, but sometimes,

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.770
like the proverbial monkeys typing away
on typewriters,

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.900
YouTube generates a URL that contains, by chance, a word.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.020
The official music video for 50 Cent's

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.080
'In Da Club' contains a synonym for bottom.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.460
This video was assigned 'hello',

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:16.060
there are some 'sexies' and a sauce. If you
want to find out if a particular word

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.030
has been randomly assigned to a video
yet, you can search for it

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.670
by using this string in Google.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.739
The point is, randomness is difficult to identify.
It is easier to be certain that something

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.900
is not random than that it is. But despite this elusiveness something interesting

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.560
is going on right now. Increasingly, we,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.569
especially young people, are calling
clearly predictable

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.069
things random.

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.080
Like randomly running into your best friend at a popular restaurant.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.260
Or hilariously bizarre combinations of things that we call

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.109
totally random because they are
seemingly unrelated,

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.680
even though, of course, they were chosen
not in random but in a very determined way

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.159
because they are all unrelated.

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.540
Those guys that showed up at the party last night you didn't know,

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.599
they weren't randos in a mathematical sense.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.759
They knew about the party, we're in
the mood to go to a party and we're in the area.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.909
Pretty predictable, actually.

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:23.189
This non-statistical use of the word random annoys

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.620
some people but it's not that far off
from the original meaning

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.099
of the word. In the 1300s, random

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.200
meant running or at great speed.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.959
Later, it would be used to describe
things that have no definite purpose.

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:44.099
It wasn't until the 1800s that random
took on a particular mathematical definition.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.319
Then in the 1970s, MIT's student paper

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:54.059
popularised the use of the word random
to simply mean strange.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.900
Of course, just because
something is strange doesn't mean it has

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.930
no discoverable cause. Why have we started
calling so many predictable things

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.299
random? Well, many theories revolve around

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.019
the amount up information and new people
we are confronted with

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.400
at an increasing rate; now more than ever
before.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.790
Perhaps it's just easier, almost a bit of a relief

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.830
to call things random, so that we can move on

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.890
to synthesise other information.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.660
Take a look at this die.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.300
Now, as you can see, it rolls a five most of the time

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.320
but not all the time. Over time

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.750
a sequence of its results will contain
less randomness.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.280
But it is still random. Any face is
possible and I have no guarantee beforehand

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.010
of knowing which face will show up. The
outcomes I'm selecting from make the

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.410
resulting sequence less full of

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.280
randomness but the process is still random.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.380
Even though a die and a coin are
extremely sensitive to their initial conditions,

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.560
and, over the course of normal use, are
quite

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.560
unpredictable, they do over time

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.010
exhibit certain biases. Biases that make them

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.200
a bit more predictable and a little less random

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.070
than you might think. First of all, dice. Even
precision dice are only quality

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.030
controlled within a few micrometers.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.200
You can check this out yourself. Make

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.880
two stacks of ten or more similar dice.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.960
Now, if you orient each die every which way,
you should pretty much get two equally sized stacks

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.500
But, if you arrange each stack

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.270
along a shared axis, so that every die
faces the same way,

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.890
any regular imperfections caused by the
manufacturing process may become visible.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.320
But what about coins?

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.410
Well, some fantastic research has been
done on what happens when they spin

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.730
and flip. For instance, it has been found that US
nickel is just the right diameter and

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.550
thickness to wind up landing

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.900
not heads up or tails up when flipped,
but on its

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.270
side, about once every six thousand
times it's flipped.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.130
But what about the fairness of flipping
a coin? Well, if you flip a coin like

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.700
this, for statistical and physical reasons
the side facing up

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.660
before the flip begins, doesn't actually have
a fifty percent chance of being the result.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.900
Instead, as researchers at Stanford have
found, it actually has

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.400
a fifty one percent chance. In this case it was the other side though.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.050
Still pretty random.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.060
If you want a coin flip to be as fair as possible,

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.850
you should just catch it in your hand. Don't
allow it to hit the ground, bounce, tumble

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.090
and spin. That's because researchers have
found that when a coin spins

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.340
larger biases come into play. The shape of its edge,

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.370
its centre of gravity. The heavier side tends to go down

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.560
quite often. In the case of some coins as often as

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.080
eighty percent of the time. It's been
found that a one euro coin

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.860
will spin, and land heads up, more often than not,

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.949
and a US penny will land tails up

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:57.039
more often than not when spun. But like I said

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:01.270
earlier, theoretically if we knew
everything about the initial conditions

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.490
of a coin flip or a die roll, we could

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.620
calculate beforehand their outcome.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.480
Why don't we do that more often?

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.840
Well, it's extremely difficult.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.980
Insane amounts of precision would be required because the smallest

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.389
difference between two initial
conditions can be magnified over time

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:26.260
leading to chaotic, extremely difficult
to predict, results.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.920
Random.org, the service Derek and I used

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.240
at the beginning of this video to generate a
random number, uses

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.050
atmospheric noise. It's extremely hard to predict,

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.680
but technically still a deterministic system.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.870
All that noise came from somewhere and
if we could just find out those initial

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.250
conditions we could,

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.199
theoretically, predict their outcomes.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.140
If we want a system more random

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.940
than that we will need to find one that
is determined by nothing

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:02.440
and for that let's look closer. Quantumly close.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.000
Quantum mechanics may have our answer.

00:08:06.009 --> 00:08:09.490
It describes the properties of quantumly
sized things

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.470
as probabilities;

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:17.360
just chances. Not because we don't know enough
yet to be certain,

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.599
or predict, but because, well, the idea is

00:08:20.599 --> 00:08:24.000
there's nothing there to predict.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.099
There is no beforehand we could know.

00:08:27.099 --> 00:08:31.789
Whether or not a particular individual
radioactive atom will decay or not,

00:08:31.789 --> 00:08:34.909
or whatever the spin of an electron is,

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:39.560
is only knowable once we look. They're
determined by a deep-seated

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.040
randomness woven into the universe itself.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.640
Einstein couldn't believe this.
He refused to accept, as he said,

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.959
that "God played dice with the universe."

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.160
But... experiments

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.310
with entangled particles have shown

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.820
violations of Bell inequalities.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.079
Entangled particles are particles that
exhibit similar properties

00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:09.190
even when separated by large distances.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:13.959
Now, if they agreed on those shared
properties to have, or are somehow

00:09:13.959 --> 00:09:17.190
determined beforehand to have them, their behaviors

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:21.959
should satisfy Bell's famous inequalities.
But experiments have found

00:09:21.959 --> 00:09:27.079
that instead the likelihood of what a
machine will see when measuring one particle

00:09:27.089 --> 00:09:32.349
determines how the other machine will
measure the other particle.

00:09:32.349 --> 00:09:38.860
It is here, when we look that the chance is
determined. Explanations for this

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.740
are even weirder but what the results
suggest is that

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.930
the chance of seeing particular quantum qualities

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.540
don't pre-exist.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:52.150
They happen when you look.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:55.740
So, if you are ever feeling boring or

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:59.459
predictable, just remember that you are
made out of octillions

00:09:59.459 --> 00:10:03.640
of quantum probabilities. Dice that don't
tumble in any

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.720
analysable way we could ever predict.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.940
They are the most random thing.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.920
God may play dice with the universe, but they are

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.949
the best dice in the universe.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.160
And as always,

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.760
thanks for watching.

00:10:23.459 --> 00:10:26.379
But what does it all mean?

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.820
Well, true randomness doesn't mean anything.
I mean, for us to have meaning we need

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:37.640
structure, predictability and that is what I'm
exploring over on my channel, Veritasium.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.060
Wow, okay. So

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:42.170
let's go over there and take a look at what is

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.300
not random. Veritasium, let's go.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.600
I'll see you guys over there. 
It's going to be awesome, come with us.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.480
And as always,

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.160
thanks for watching.
