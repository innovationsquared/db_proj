00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.299
Hey, Vsauce Michael here, and today
we are going to be talking about the past.

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.559
But not like history—in fact—we will
be talking about what we call now.

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.849
This very newest moment in time,
and the fact that we can

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.509
never really be aware of or live
in what we call now,

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.319
because it takes time for our brain

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:24.569
to process the information about
what's happening now,

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:28.399
and it takes time for that information
to get from the rest of our body

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.079
to our brain.

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.499
In fact, the taller you are,

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:37.119
the further back from now, the further
back from the past you live.

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:39.629
But more importantly, why do we call

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.919
emotional, relationship-based movies

00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:44.499
targeted at females
chick flicks?

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:46.179
Well, for the answers to these questions,

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:49.179
we're going to start with the
flash lag effect.

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:53.349
David Eagleman has done some amazing
research on this effect.

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:58.609
It's what occurs when a participant looks
at a ring moving around in a circle.

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.029
A light is flashing exactly in the middle
of the ring.

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:07.189
This is exactly what the photons landing
on their retinas represent.

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.989
But when asked what they saw, participants
responded they saw this.

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:15.959
Now, for the longest time, it was
hypothesized that people said this

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:18.129
because our brains guess ahead.

00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:22.039
Our brain assumed that the ring
would continue doing what it had been doing,

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.839
and figured it would be safer to go ahead
and say that the ring was already

00:01:24.839 --> 00:01:26.549
a bit ahead of the light.

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.089
But Eagleman wanted to know what
would happen if

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.389
when that flash of light occurred in
the middle of the ring,

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:34.389
the ring all of a sudden reversed direction

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:36.729
and spun around the other way.

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.149
If our brains really are guessing ahead,

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.859
participants should still say

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:43.939
that they saw this,

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.029
because the brain figured that the ring
would be there and were surprised

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:48.479
when it went the other direction.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.829
But instead, participants
said that they saw this.

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.739
Now, how could they have seen this
if they had no way of knowing

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:58.539
that the ring was going to reverse direction?
Were their brains clairvoyant?

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.489
Can our brains see into the future?

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:04.169
As it turns out, no.

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:08.919
What's really happening here is that
our eyeballs are receiving an image—

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.929
an image of a flash of light
inside a ring.

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:15.269
But then our brains wait a little bit

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.729
to make sure that we have the full story.

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:20.519
And as the ring begins to reverse direction,

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.609
that new information is incorporated
into what we actually sense,

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:29.449
and we become aware of the wrong
version of now.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.649
By doing more studies with
rings traveling at different speeds,

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:34.409
Eagleman was able to determine

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.449
that what we are aware of as now,

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:40.289
what our brain tells us is happening

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:44.709
actually happened 80 milliseconds
in the past!

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.049
Now, 80 milliseconds is not a lot of time,

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.049
but it's a little scary to think that
our brain has no

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.219
physical way of knowing, being aware of,
or even living anywhere

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.389
but slightly in the past.

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.149
Nerve impulses travel through our body

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:08.189
at a top speed of around 250 miles per hour.

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.947
But now, look at Bill Warner
on a motorcycle.

00:03:11.947 --> 00:03:13.414
He's going really fast.

00:03:13.414 --> 00:03:17.295
In fact, he's going 278 miles per hour,

00:03:17.295 --> 00:03:20.007
which means that this guy on a motorcycle

00:03:20.007 --> 00:03:23.963
is traveling faster than my brain
can even figure

00:03:23.963 --> 00:03:26.838
out what now is.

00:03:26.838 --> 00:03:31.760
Keep in mind that 250 miles per hour
is the top speed

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.015
for neural impulses within our body.

00:03:34.015 --> 00:03:38.434
If I tap my nose and tap my toes

00:03:38.434 --> 00:03:40.354
at the exact same time,

00:03:40.354 --> 00:03:42.366
it feels instantaneous,

00:03:42.366 --> 00:03:46.409
even though there is no physical way
that the brain could actually be receiving that,

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.527
because when I tap my nose,
the message goes right into my brain.

00:03:49.527 --> 00:03:55.409
But when I tap my toes, the message
has to travel across the entire length of my body.

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:01.088
The brain waits momentarily to make sure that there's nothing else going on or coming in,

00:04:01.088 --> 00:04:03.587
and then corroborates all that information

00:04:03.587 --> 00:04:07.498
and we become aware that the taps were
indeed instantaneous.

00:04:07.498 --> 00:04:11.084
But we don't become aware of that tap
until the brain is sure,

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:14.132
which means that the taller you are,

00:04:14.132 --> 00:04:17.606
the longer the brain has to wait
for that physical message to come from your toes,

00:04:17.606 --> 00:04:23.112
the further behind you technically are
in actually feeling the touch—

00:04:23.112 --> 00:04:26.434
the further back in the past you're living.

00:04:26.434 --> 00:04:31.055
When there's a delay like that between
sensory information or brain processing,

00:04:31.055 --> 00:04:36.286
we become used to that delay and begin
to just see them as instantaneous events,

00:04:36.286 --> 00:04:38.989
which leads to some weird behavior.

00:04:38.989 --> 00:04:41.924
If participants are pushing a button

00:04:41.924 --> 00:04:47.262
that causes a light to flash with a delay
between the two actions of about 80 milliseconds,

00:04:47.262 --> 00:04:49.843
they will learn that it's instantaneous.

00:04:49.843 --> 00:04:53.002
But if the researchers shorten that distance

00:04:53.002 --> 00:04:56.893
so that now when the button is pushed, the light
flashes in only—let's say—

00:04:56.893 --> 00:04:59.056
40 milliseconds, the participants,

00:04:59.056 --> 00:05:03.780
even though they are actually causing the light to come on
will deny it and they'll say,

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.437
"No way! That came on before I pushed the button!
I didn't do it!"

00:05:07.437 --> 00:05:10.526
That was also a flash of light.

00:05:10.526 --> 00:05:13.451
But light bulbs don't receive a continuous

00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:16.072
direct stream of electricity through the wire.

00:05:16.072 --> 00:05:20.588
Instead, they receive alternating current
in most businesses and households.

00:05:20.588 --> 00:05:23.798
So the filament is actually being excited

00:05:23.798 --> 00:05:27.252
and left alone about 50 to 60 times a second.

00:05:27.252 --> 00:05:30.381
But our eyeballs don't notice any flicker for a few reasons.

00:05:30.381 --> 00:05:33.561
One, it's happening really fast, but
mainly because that filament

00:05:33.561 --> 00:05:36.842
continues to be super hot during
that little gap in time.

00:05:36.842 --> 00:05:40.719
The only way to really see this flicker is to use a high frame rate camera

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:43.970
when a light bulb is being turned
on or off so it's cooler.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.930
There's the flicker.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.113
You know what else flickers?

00:05:48.113 --> 00:05:49.891
A film projector.

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:53.538
It's easy to think that a film projector works
merely because a roll of film

00:05:53.538 --> 00:05:56.280
is dragged across a light source, but if that were the case,

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.917
a movie screen would be a blur of fast moving images.

00:05:59.917 --> 00:06:02.833
Instead, a shudder is used.

00:06:02.833 --> 00:06:04.905
The shudder opens and closes

00:06:04.905 --> 00:06:07.506
to let an image hit the screen, and then when shut,

00:06:07.506 --> 00:06:11.336
the next image comes into place and it
opens and puts that on the screen.

00:06:11.336 --> 00:06:13.794
Now, early films were shot at only about

00:06:13.794 --> 00:06:16.009
16 frames per second.

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:18.670
So sitting in the theater, you would see a bright image

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:23.597
flashed 16 times on the screen, which was not fast enough to not be noticeable.

00:06:23.597 --> 00:06:25.802
So, movies flickered,

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:28.555
which is why they were called flicks, which is where

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:31.064
we get the word chick flick.

00:06:31.064 --> 00:06:33.228
All right, I'm gonna go now.

00:06:33.228 --> 00:06:36.326
And of course, by now, I mean I will leave

00:06:36.326 --> 00:06:39.496
80 milliseconds before you
become aware that I've left.

00:06:39.496 --> 00:06:42.669
I put three links to previous
Vsauce videos in the description

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:45.006
that are related to this one if you
haven't seen them yet.

00:06:45.006 --> 00:06:49.668
One is about why time feels
like it's going faster as we get older.

00:06:49.668 --> 00:06:52.086
Another is about the frame rate
of the eyeball,

00:06:52.086 --> 00:06:55.053
and the other is about the stopped
clock illusion.

00:06:55.053 --> 00:06:57.379
Have fun, and as always,
thanks for watching.
