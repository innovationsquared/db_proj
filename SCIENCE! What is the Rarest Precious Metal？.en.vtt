00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.260
Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.500
And I'm in Anaheim at VidCon.
I hope to see some of you here, because I

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.240
like you guys.
But I can't marry all of you.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.440
But if I did put a ring on it, what is the
most precious thing you could make that ring

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.180
out of?
Silver, gold, platinum.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.170
Those are all fine, but I wanna know what
is the rarest, most scarce thing on Earth

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.830
that's stable and safe to wear I could make
that ring out of.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.280
And I want it to be pure.
I'm talking elemental.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.280
Well, luckily, I recently went to the University
of Nottingham, home of Periodic Videos and

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.880
experimented with some elements.
First things first, zinc dissolved in mercury.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.160
This stuff is awesome, it's dense, it's heavy,
it's liquid metal.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.380
It's cool, but even cooler is human urine.
Thank you Neil.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.240
Of course I am just kidding.
This is an aqueous solution of the metal vanadium.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:08.780
And when we mix vanadium in with the mercury
and the zinc, the mercury helps the zinc give

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:15.100
electrons to the vanadium.
And is it gains more and more electrons, it

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.979
changes colour.
We're looking for purple.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.180
I love shaking this, it's crazy, it's like
throwing me off balance.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.520
It's so heavy.
Look at that.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.520
Thank you electrons.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.740
Those colours were beautiful, but vanadium

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:43.049
is not that rare.
I wanna get something more precious.

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.329
And how about precious personally, like my dad?

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.320
He's a chemical engineer who specifically
works with and has a patent concerning one

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.129
element.
Sulphur.

00:01:55.129 --> 00:02:00.229
Of course a fun thing to do with sulphur is
to make it bark like a dog.

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.140
Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna take a glass tube and fill it

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.229
with laughing gas, nitrous oxide.
We're gonna pour a little bit of water into

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.950
the tube to cushion and protect the tube and
then we're gonna pour in some liquid carbon

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.070
disulphide.
It's very volatile and will evaporate, giving

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.580
us a mixture of gases inside this tube.
Finally, I will light the top of the tube,

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.340
causing the carbon disulphide to burn.
And as it burns, the temperature and pressure

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.660
in the tube will increase, causing the reaction
to go faster and faster.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.920
It'll accelerate and bark.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.420
Wow.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.460
And look at all the sulphur on the sides of the tube.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.000
That reaction was fun and cool and colourful,
but we're way off track here.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.850
Even though sulphur is precious and dear to
my heart, it's not that rare at all.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:03.130
So let's get crazy and talk about astatine.
Astatine is so rare here on Earth that we

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.930
don't even know what it looks like.
If you were to try to get enough astatine

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.090
atoms together that you could see it with
your own eyes, it would instantly vaporise

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.140
itself because of its radioactive heat.
The fact that it's so radioactive means it

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.790
wouldn't be great as a ring, so let's move
on to something a little bit more standard

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.410
and see where it takes us.
Gold.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:31.170
Gold, of course, is famous for its un-reactivity,
which is why it's a great way to store your

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.410
wealth.
If you have a lot of gold laying around, the

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.319
likelihood that it will combine with other
elements and dissolve or rust or corrode is

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.859
basically zero,
with the exception of some special solutions.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.100
In particular, one discovered in 1300s with
the fancy name "aqua regia."

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.459
It's made out of hydrochloric acid and nitric
acid and we're about to make some right now

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.250
thanks to Neil from Periodic Videos.
Of course, we're using this fume cover, because

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.350
the fumes that come off the nitric acid are
quite dangerous.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.350
It's the gas NO2 and if you inhale it, nitric
acid forms in your lungs.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.760
So instead of doing that, let's put some gold
in aqua regia.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.420
We're just gonna use this ancient priceless
Egyptian relic.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.209
Let's go ahead and try this out.
As the gold dissolves, what we wind up with

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:27.319
in the evaporating dish is chloroauric acid.
Auric coming from aurum, the Latin word for

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:32.039
gold, which is why gold's symbol on the periodic
table is Au.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.039
It's really sad to watch that gold dissolve away.

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.800
I wish there was a way for us to just make
other things into gold.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.960
Now I know what you're thinking.
"Michael, that's alchemy."

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.099
But alchemy is quite real.
In today's particle accelerators we can smash

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:52.919
particles together, creating elements.
At the accelerator collider at GSI they can

00:04:52.919 --> 00:05:01.210
create gold by smashing particles together
at a rate of 2 million gold atoms every second.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.860
That's pretty cool, right?
Well, as you know, atoms are incredibly small.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.809
They're so small that even though GSI can
make 2 million new gold atoms every single

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:19.659
second, were they to leave the machine on
at that rate for 50 million years they would

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:28.219
only produce 1 gram of gold.
Gold is rare and precious and expensive.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:35.020
But gold is 40% more common than iridium.
And iridium is incredibly resilient.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.139
It doesn't dissolve in aqua regia and it's
not even attacked by molten metals or silicates

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:46.449
at high temperature, which is nice and ..., but
not as pretty as cerium, which reacts at high

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:52.259
temperature to form beautiful little sparkles.
As we continue our journey to discover the

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:57.099
rarest thing to make a ring out of, we've
got to discuss osmium.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:03.040
This stuff is so rare there's fewer than one
part per billion in our Earth's crust.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.180
But we're not done yet.
Iridium and osmium are both in the platinum

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.110
family.
And if you take a look at platinum, it's much

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.900
more common than both iridium and osmium,
but there's something neat that I think we

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.720
should consider.
Stable isotopes.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.740
And it's one of the isotopes of platinum that
will finish our story.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.080
Platinum-190.
It's a stable isotope with half-life of over

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.480
billion years that's non-reactive.
It's fits all our criteria.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.919
A ring made of the scarcest, naturally
occurring stable, non-reactive thing.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.400
So hey, it would be an awesome ring.
Now, you're probably wondering, "Michael,

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.460
why did you experiment with vanadium, sulphur,
gold and cerium?"

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:48.379
Well, here's what's interesting.
Take a look at the periodic table and there's

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:50.819
symbols.
Ta-da!

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:51.799
Vsauce.

00:06:51.799 --> 00:06:52.799
And as always,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.020
thanks for watching.
