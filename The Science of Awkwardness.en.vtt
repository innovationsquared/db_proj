00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.310
Hey, Vsauce.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.710
Michael here.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.639
Not knowing what to do with your hands

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.980
or offering a handshake

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.690
when the other person offers a fist bump.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.640
Forgetting someone's name...

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.280
Not having anything to say and
forgetting your phone at home so you can't

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.320
be distracted by it.
Getting caught staring at a stranger.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.940
Striking up a conversation with someone
you don't know in a bathroom.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.489
Someone oversharing, telling a group

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.800
too much information.
Overhearing a couple breaking up.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.790
Noticing food in someone's teeth but not
telling them and, well, now it's been too

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.530
long and bringing up would be weird.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.390
Smelling a fart in an elevator that wasn't yours

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.690
but, well, now you can't even react to it
or mention that you've noticed it

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.880
or pretend to even know what a fart is.
All of those things

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.760
are awkward.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.260
We don't like

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.890
awkwardness. It makes us uncomfortable, cringe.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.480
But what is awkwardness?

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.040
Why is it good and who is the main character

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.760
of the universe?

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.830
To really understand awkwardness we need
to put it in context with the entire

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.890
family of forces that guide social behaviour.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.420
Think of this sheet of cardboard as a
list all possible behaviours.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.270
It's not infinite because of
the limits of science and biology.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.370
You can't move faster than light
or be in two places at once.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.800
You can't wear pants made out of molten lead.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.920
Next, there are legal limits - the laws of the state.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.340
They delineate what you agree
not to do, lest the authorities

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.430
punish you - murder, stealing, speeding. What's left

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.470
is molded by the finder tool of social expectations.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.000
It's not illegal to chew with your mouth open or

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.210
not cover a sneeze on a crowded bus or

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.590
act disrespectfully, but it is frowned upon.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.459
Punished not by the police, but by social ostracism,

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.170
public opprobrium. Being called rude,

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.180
gross, mean, annoying.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.010
Awkwardness is the finest tool. It sands

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.819
social dynamics by smoothing out what
even etiquette doesn't rule on.

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.690
It's not a violation of the laws of physics
to accidentally hug someone

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.090
for longer than they expected.
It's not against the law

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.750
either. And the etiquette
for how long a hug should last

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.280
isn't black-and-white. But it is

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.780
awkward. Like touching a hot stove or
getting a parking fine or losing friends,

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.870
awkwardness nudges us to
avoid certain actions in the future

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.599
and smooth things out when they happen.
People who demonstrate

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.569
self-consciousness when needed

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.980
are communicating cooperative intentions,

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.530
which helps them get along well with
others. It's no coincidence that brains,

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.780
susceptible to feeling occasional
awkwardness, would become so common.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.950
They're successful at cooperating,

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.799
at social life. Feeling awkward shows
that you understand

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.810
and are keen on smooth social exchanges.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.970
Now, too much or too little concern for social rules

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.600
isn't healthy, but researchers found that just the right

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.660
amount is great.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.930
When a person shows remorse or embarrassment or

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.070
awkward discomfort, when appropriate,

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.460
others perceive them as being more
trustworthy, and their actions as

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.670
more forgivable. And it's not just perception.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.460
Such individuals also tend to be more
objectively prosocial when tested.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:11.720
Kinder, more generous. Even when a person
is completely oblivious to a faux pas

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.680
they've committed,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.900
awkwardness still arises.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.239
People around them can feel uncomfortable. It's called

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.520
vicarious embarrassment and it's a function

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.220
of empathy - the ability to feel what others feel

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.350
or will feel, when

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.340
or if they realize what they've just done.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.540
The more 'EEE' someone is, that is

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.430
easily sympathetically embarrassed,
the harder it is for them to sit through

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.920
other people's cringe-inducing moments,

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.100
even fictional once like in cringe comedy.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.940
Researchers found that being more easily
and pathetically embarrassed

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.470
does not correlate to be more easily
embarrassed yourself.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.180
Instead, it's linked to being more empathetic,

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.700
an important capacity for social creatures to have.
Our seemingly

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.550
counter-intuitive attraction to viewing cringing moments

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.840
like, say, bad American Idol auditions,
is perhaps then just a light form

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.480
of morbid curiosity. You may think that

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.810
awkwardness is totally different from physical pain

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.210
or outright name-calling.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.150
But your brain would disagree. You see,

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.630
researchers found that social missteps
activate, among other regions,

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.110
the secondary somatosensory cortex and

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.780
dorsal posterior insula - areas of the
brain that are also connected

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.480
to the sensation of physical pain. Our brains

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.460
process the breaking of social standards
and the breaking of

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.450
bones through similar neural pathways. Likewise

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.680
the same sympathetic nervous system that
mobilizes you to deal with physical

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.290
threats,

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.680
"fight or flight", is activated by social challenges

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.840
where awkwardness or embarrassment

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.970
might be at stake.
Like events where you are very aware

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.460
of being watched. Speaking in front of a group or

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.570
embarrassing yourself in front of
onlookers or having nothing to say

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.990
on a first date.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.680
Awkward silence...

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.120
Your blood pressure increases, causing you to overheat

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.740
and sweat.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.560
Oxygen is needed for

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.950
fighting and running, so breathing
increases and digestion shuts down, causing

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.310
nausea and butterflies in your stomach.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.660
Your body instinctively contracts into a
protective fetal position and

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.120
fighting that reaction to act natural makes you shake.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.790
Blood vessels in your extremities
contract to prioritize major organs

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.500
leaving you with cold fingers

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.280
and toes and nose. These symptoms don't

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.510
alleviate awkwardness, they compound it.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.240
But that's history's fault.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.080
Long before human social dynamics
were complicated enough to involve

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.860
"is it one kiss or two?" or politics

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.870
at Thanksgiving dinner,
we developed primitive reactions to

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.390
physical threats and haven't had
enough time yet to evolve

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.750
newer ones. Self-conscious

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.140
anxiety can be tough to get out of our
minds after we've done something

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.590
awkward. Fixating on social blunders is

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.370
easy and hard to overcome.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.560
Why was I so unsure, so unconfident,

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.010
so awkward? Well, some of the blame

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:42.030
may lie with the neurotransmitter oxytocin.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.260
Oxytocin is sometimes called "the love hormone"

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.430
because it modulates prosocial feelings, like trust

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.610
and attachment, which it does. In fact,

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:55.140
nasal sprays of oxytocin are being used to increase

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.970
trust during couples therapy
and in the reduction of anxiety

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:03.470
and depression. Though there are fears
that it could also be used to

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:07.520
deviously increase trust and make a
person more susceptible

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.060
to con artist schemes. But oxytocin

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.440
also modulates negative social feelings like

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.690
fear and anxiety. A dose of it

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:21.910
makes people better at recognizing the
facial expressions for disgust

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.630
and fright. It's also involved in the
feelings that make us

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:30.270
approach or avoid certain social stimuli.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.610
And it may play a role in making positive and negative

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.860
social interactions more salient

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.290
in our memories; that is, stand out more,

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:43.490
command more of our attention after the fact, make us

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:47.200
think about them more. Negative ones

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.270
especially because of what psychologists call

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:54.110
negativity bias. All things being equal,

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.870
negative social interactions and negative emotions

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:02.400
have a greater impact on our mental
states than positive ones.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.100
In fact, we have more words for negative emotions

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.880
than positive ones and a richer vocabulary

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:15.120
to describe them. Thus such memories and
thoughts can be tough to just

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.910
get over. What does the other person think of me?

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:24.010
I was so awkward. Are they telling other people?
We replace social encounters in

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.300
our heads over and over again.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.070
Surely, the person we were awkward with
remembers us the same way

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:33.300
we're remembering ourselves
and is equally fixated on that

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.890
awkward thing we did. Or are they?

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:43.040
A great wet blanket for smothering the
fire of self-conscious anxieties

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.970
is perspective.
Consider the famous advice of Eleanor Roosevelt:

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:51.300
"You wouldn't worry so much
about what others think of you

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.520
if you realized how seldom they do."

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.040
As much as you

00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:01.700
obsess over yourself, you're not the
first thing on everyone else's minds.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.770
They're worried about themselves, what

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:08.520
you think about them.
And, more importantly, what they think about

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.080
themselves.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.350
You're not the centre of their world.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:18.270
Another famous old piece of advice tells
us that in your twenties and thirties

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:23.170
you worry about what other people think
about you. In your forties and fifties

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.920
you stop worrying what other people
think about you. And then

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:31.080
finally in your sixties and seventies
you realize that they were never

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.270
thinking about you

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.370
in the first place. 

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:40.420
The tendency to act and think as though you are the
true main character of the universe

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.530
has been called protagonist disease.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:47.200
It seeps into our behavior all the time.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.430
For instance, the fundamental attribution

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.620
error. When evaluating actions you

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:58.040
often view yourself as a complex
character, acted upon by

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.300
various challenges and antagonist, whereas

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.650
other people are seen as just
one-dimensional background characters

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.230
with simple unchanging

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:12.390
roles. The guy who took way too long
ordering in front of you this morning,

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.970
well, he's obviously just innately annoying person.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:20.550
That's his entire purpose.
But when you take too long ordering,

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:24.730
it's because the staff was unhelpful
or you were flustered,

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.830
preoccupied by an earlier conversation.

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:32.540
You are the main character after all.
You know a lot more about what's going on

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.870
in your life. It's easy to live like that.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:39.430
There isn't time or mental space to
consider every other person

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:43.810
as complicated and fully flushed out.
But they are.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:49.060
The realization of this has a name.
A name given to it by The Dictionary

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:53.350
of Obscure Sorrows, one of my favorite resources

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:59.030
and now, YouTube channels. They wrap
profound concepts up in tiny little word

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.460
packages.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.320
To be sure, giving something a name
doesn't show that you know it or

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.580
how to feel about it but nonetheless
words put handles on things,

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:12.990
so we can manipulate them,
hold them down, offer them to others,

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:16.150
feel bigger than the concepts they label.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:19.330
Now, their word for acknowledging that you are just

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:24.080
an extra in other people's stories,
not even cast in most of them,

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:28.770
is 'sonder'. This is their definition of it.

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.780
"Sonder - the realization that each

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.380
random passerby is living a life as vivid

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:40.020
and complex as your own—populated
with their own ambitions,

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.540
friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness—

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:48.740
an epic story that continues
invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.260
deep underground, with 

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.670
elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.840
that you’ll never know existed, in which you might

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:01.910
only appear once,
as an extra sipping coffee in the background,

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:05.760
as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a 

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.000
lighted window at dusk."

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.230
Acknowledging this makes your awkwardness

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:15.500
looks small. But it also makes

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.690
all of you look small.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:22.250
Tiny. A needle in a giant haystack,

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.710
but nonetheless in possession of a big

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:29.070
idea. Your blemishes are

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:32.960
lost from far away, and so is your uniqueness,

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.850
but the view from way up here... Well,

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.000
it's unbeatable.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.590
And as always,

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:41.650
thanks for watching.
