Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.799
And I'm in Los Angeles, but today we're going
to talk about love.

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.960
You can't buy love, but what if you could?
I mean, what if I had a machine that could

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.860
make you fall in love with someone for the
rest of your life?

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.779
What should I charge for the use of that machine?
Well, we should, first of all, be clear about

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.699
what we mean when we say "love."
I'm not talking about the love you have for

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.759
your BFFs or your love for your family or
your love of learning.

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.959
I'm also not talking about lust, an immediate
attraction we have towards other people mediated

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.440
by hormones like testosterone and oestrogen.
I'm talking about what happens later, when

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.550
you begin to associate an immediate reward
with one other person - what we call passionate

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.440
love.
This is what you see in new couples, where

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.490
they wanna be with each other and are almost
obsessed with each other.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.370
Well psychologists have a really great term
for that kind of love.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.550
They call it limerence.
That's right.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.940
Whenever you're in this state and you do things
like wake up super early to get a bagel with

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.080
the person and even though you're gonna miss
class just because you wanna see them that

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.080
badly, you're exhibiting limerent behaviour.
Okay, that sounds great.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.320
But if I wanna sell love, I'm gonna have to
find a way to measure it and it turns out

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:20.240
to be quite a difficult task.
We do have a tool called the passionate love

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.689
survey.
It was developed by psychologists and it's

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.569
been found to be quite reliable when it comes
to analysing other behaviours we associate

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:31.909
with passionate love.
For instance, we found, using the survey,

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.840
that men and women both experience the same
amounts of passionate love when they're in

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.100
a relationship.
We've also found that men tend to fall in

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.520
the love faster and sooner than women, who
appear to be more cautious.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.940
But we're here to talk about money.
Interestingly, a UK study once looked at people

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.340
who heard that someone else loved them.
They heard the phrase "I love you" for the

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.939
first time and they took the amount of happiness
those people felt and compared it to the amount

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.519
of happiness gamblers feel when they win large
sums of money.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.360
Their conclusion, that hearing that someone
loves you for the first time is the equivalent

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:18.459
happiness level of receiving 267,000 dollars.
But when you go beyond passionate love to

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.379
committed long-term love, there's all kinds
of practical benefits marriage brings.

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:29.000
In fact, it's been estimated that tax breaks
and health care costs all together mean that

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.420
being married is the equivalent of receiving
an extra 100,000 dollars a year.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.200
Now we have a lot of ways of visualizing the
effect having money has on a person.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.160
For instance, we know that in wealthier countries
people report feeling respect more often.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.420
They also report eating tastier foods, for
instance.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.120
But here's what's really awesome.
Take a look at the graph of wealth against

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.989
love.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.880
It doesn't matter.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.660
Love is democratic, no matter who you are
or how much money you have, people all over

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.000
the world are feeling it.
It should be noted that having more money

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.780
does not necessarily equate to being more
happy.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.739
This is what's known as the hedonistic treadmill.
Getting more money helps with happiness, but

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.349
only up to a certain point.
In United States that point is about 75,000

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.790
dollars a year.
At that point, more money has diminishing

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.430
returns on how happy it makes you.
Another thing that correlates to having more

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.810
money, more wealth, is living longer, having
a larger life expectancy.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.480
But you know what else correlates to living
longer?

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.640
Love.
But not just passionate love, the kind of

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.940
love that follows it - committed, long-term
love.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.920
In fact, people who form life-long pair bonds
with another person live, on average, 15%

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.200
longer.
So if you wanna be really non-hard-scienc-y

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.080
about it, all other things being equal and
assuming that you're not already super super

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:03.959
rich, finding a pair bond, finding a relationship
that lasts for life is the equivalent of making

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.709
about an extra 30 to 40 thousand dollars a
year.

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.069
Now, like I said, that's not hard science,
but you know what is?

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:18.180
Vasopressin and oxytocin, the chemicals that
are exuded in people's brains when they

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.410
look at photos of people that they formed
committed, long-term relationships with.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.500
These chemicals are incredible.
We've also seen elevated levels of them in

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.860
dogs that have been pet for really long time.
And we also know that couples who receive

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.229
high levels of these chemicals resolve conflicts
faster.

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:42.030
And, people who struggle to produce these
chemicals in their brain have a similar struggle

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:49.430
when it comes to forming long-term relationships.
In fact, you can raise your levels of oxytocin

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.130
or vasopressin inside your own brain by simply
looking into someone else's eyes.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.300
That's right.
So, in a way, looking into the eyes of somebody

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:08.650
that you like is the administration of a psycho-active
drug that's addictive and the long-term consequences

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.890
are living longer.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.880
Thanks for watching.
