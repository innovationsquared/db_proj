00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.040
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.780
Down here.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.560
But which way is down?

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.420
And how much does down weigh? Well, down weighs about a 100th of a gram per cubic centimeter.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.060
It is light and airy, which makes it a great source of insulation and buoyancy for water birds.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.380
But if you let go of down...

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.840
It falls down.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.580
So that's which way down is.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.960
It's the direction gravity is pulling everything in.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.920
Now, for someone on the other side of the Earth, my down is their up.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.420
But where are falling things going? Why do things fall?

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.680
Are they being pushed, or pulled, or is it because of time travel?

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.460
First things first: let's turn the Sun into a black hole.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.000
We can do that using Universe Sandbox 2, this simulator will blow your mind. I love it.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.380
In fact, I love it so much I put a code to get the game for free in the current Curiosity Box.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.180
If you're not subscribed to the box yet, you are missing out!

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.240
Okay, look, for the purposes of this video, we want the Solar System.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.420
And here it is. Notice that everything's moving pretty quickly around the Sun.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.720
That's because we currently have the game set so that every second that passes for us,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.220
is 14 days, almost, in the game.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.740
If I change this to one second,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.280
we're looking at the Solar System in real time.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.880
You'll notice that it almost looks like it's frozen.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.600
Even though the earth is traveling around the Sun at about 30 km/s, it barely appears to be moving.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.640
That is how vast space is. Anyway, let's go back to 14 days

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.560
I like that motion. Now look at the Sun

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.259
It is not, currently, a black hole, but we can change that. What we need to do is compress the Sun.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.720
So let's lock its mass so that it doesn't change while we make its radius smaller.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.959
Let's make its radius as small as we can.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.860
And, oh, where'd it go? Well it's still there, it's just become a black hole.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.440
Pretty spooky, but now, let's look at the rest of the Solar System.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.819
Alright, zooming out and-

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:07.959
huh.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.120
Nothing's... changed. I mean something's changed.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.000
It's colder and darker, but nothing's flying off into space or getting sucked in.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.340
You see,  by shrinking the Sun, we didn't change the direction of down for the planets.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.739
They're always being pulled by gravity towards its middle and making it smaller didn't move where the middle was.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.800
But also, the strength of that force pulling them to the middle of the sun stayed the same.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.420
That gives us a clue as to what down is.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.980
The clue is the other thing we didn't change: mass.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.200
Mass is a measure of how hard it is to accelerate something; to change its motion.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.400
Now right now, these two balls have zero motion relative to me.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.560
Slapping around this hollow plastic ball

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.109
is pretty easy, but doing the same to this solid steel ball

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.680
is a lot harder.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.940
Now gravity and weight have nothing to do with this.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.280
Gravity acts downward, not against my horizontal slapping.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.400
Of course, gravity does contribute to friction, but friction works against me when I start moving the ball,

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.018
but works with me when I stop the ball.

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.739
And the steel ball is harder to stop than the plastic ball.

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.149
The difference is mass. The steel ball is more massive

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:30.940
It's more resistant to having its motion changed.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.700
Mass is an intrinsic property; it does not depend on what's around or change from place to place.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.620
It can sometimes be thought of as the amount of matter something has.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.960
Your mass is the same regardless of where you are.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.760
On the moon, on earth, in the middle of intergalactic space floating around.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.300
But all of this said, mass does seem to care about what's around.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.360
Mass loves company.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.360
Things with mass and/or energy are attracted together by a force that we call gravity.

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:08.189
The feeling of gravity is just you and the earth being attracted to one another.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.120
Now every portion of an object with mass attracts other portions towards it.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.860
The average of all this pulling is an attraction between centers of mass.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:26.500
Giant things like Earth exert an obvious pull, but everything does. Even a baseball.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.220
These two baseballs are attracted together by their own gravities.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.920
Except their masses are so small, the force is minuscule, and it can't overcome friction or push air out of the way.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.889
They're never gonna come together

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:51.809
But if you put two baseballs one meter apart in the middle of empty space where no other forces could act on them

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.579
They would literally fall together and collide.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.539
It would take three days to happen, but it would.

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:07.439
Isaac Newton found that the strength of the force bringing two things together is equal to the product of their masses

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:15.389
Divided by the distance between their centers of mass squared times big G, the gravitational constant.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.780
If you make one of two objects more massive, or move them closer together, the force will be

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.360
stronger and this force of attraction is what we call weight

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.260
So mass is intrinsic, whereas weight depends on what's around.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.139
Now, a weird thing happens when you weigh yourself on most scales.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.520
Weight is a force, but scales display pounds or kilograms,

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.980
which are units of mass.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.840
What's going on is that a scale is

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.700
activated by a force.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.289
Any force.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.999
It doesn't have to be caused by gravity. The scale then displays what amount of mass

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.310
near the surface of the earth would be attracted to the earth with the force it's detecting.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:03.819
Now since scales tend to be used on the surface of the earth, by people, on which the only force acting is gravity,

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:11.469
they tend to not be very far off. But they can be easily tricked, and they further lead to the confusion between mass and weight.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:20.289
Notice that weight is mutual. You are pulled down by earth with the same force that you pull up on earth.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.259
According to a scale, I weigh

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.990
180 pounds on earth..

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.430
And the earth weighs 180 pounds on me.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.890
But because the Earth's mass is so much greater than my own, and

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.530
because the more massive something is, the more it resists being moved, our

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.730
equal and opposite weight forces accelerate me a lot more than the earth.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:58.589
If you drop a pencil from a height of 6 feet, the pencil doesn't just fall to the earth. More precisely,

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.870
they both come together.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.719
They're attracted to each other by equal forces

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.029
but the same force moves the pencil a

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.369
lot more than the earth. When you let go of the pencil, the earth is literally pulled up

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.890
to the pencil by the pencil's own gravity, a distance equal to about 9 trillionths

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.640
the width of a proton. That

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.960
same force moves the pencil the remaining distance, which is still pretty much six feet.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:32.220
At the height of the International Space Station's orbit, you and earth are attracted about

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:39.150
10% less than when you're on the surface; about eight point eight times your mass, but not zero.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:46.679
For this reason, weightless astronauts in zero gravity are neither weightless, nor in zero gravity.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.720
Their weight force fails to bring them and earth together, because they move horizontally

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:57.690
so quickly that they fall just as fast as Earth's surface curves away from them.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.759
And even though they're experiencing 90 percent of the gravity you and I are feeling right now,

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:04.750
(That's why they don't just fly away)

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:11.880
There are no forces, called g-forces, to resist their weight, since everything around them is falling too.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:16.170
It's resistance to your weight force, stress,

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:23.189
deformation, that is needed for you to feel weight. What astronauts in orbit actually lack is

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.130
apparent weight.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.460
Likewise, a helium balloon has weight.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:35.299
I mean, it's made out of matter it clearly has mass, so it's attracted to the earth.

00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:38.119
Let's try to measure its weight force.

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:46.759
Okay, it has negative apparent weight.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:52.580
That's because its attraction to the earth is weaker than the buoyant forces from the air around it that push it up.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.500
Now, while it moves up,

00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:01.700
It pushes air molecules down, but they transfer that force widely. Not just directly down onto the scale.

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:07.369
Buoyant forces are caused by the fact that whenever you are immersed in a fluid like water or air,

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.760
molecules lower down are at greater pressure.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.310
They're being pressed by the weight of all the molecules

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.469
above them and are closer to earth, so they're pulled to it with a stronger force. Now having greater pressure

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.709
means they pack a bigger punch when they collide with things.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.459
So,

00:09:23.459 --> 00:09:25.549
horizontally, those collisions cancel out,

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:32.239
but vertically, the stronger collisions from below win out, providing lift, a buoyant force.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:38.479
This even happens on your own body. Across its surface area air lifts you with the force of about one

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:45.589
Newton, which is equal to the weight force of an apple. So if you weighed yourself in a vacuum you would weigh about

00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:47.839
this much more.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:54.679
But that's not all Earth's spin causes it to bulge at the equator so the closer you are to it

00:09:54.680 --> 00:10:01.760
The further you are from Earth's center of mass and the less your actual gravitational weight will be down is

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.190
Always changing, I mean

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:11.029
where is Earth's center of mass? It would always be the same as Earth's geometric middle if Earth's

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:18.380
composition was uniform, but earth contains pockets of massive rock at different depths water mountains

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.779
It's got moving changing insides and air and seasonal ice and though they're far away

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:30.799
Gravity extends forever from everything so the moon the Sun the planets all of them pull on you

00:10:31.709 --> 00:10:32.820
negligibly,

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:39.289
But truly. You weigh about a millionth of your weight less when the moon is directly above you

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:46.740
This chunky shifting balance of material on earth and ever where else in the universe means that down is

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.250
always

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.849
changing on top of that Earth's spin

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:56.820
Skews what you consider the direction of down away from its center of mass because the push you get from Earth's spin

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:01.440
Seems to slightly lift you reducing your apparent weight and bending down

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:03.310
towards the equator

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:10.500
The net result is an apparent weight reduction at the equator of about half of a percent if a scale guesses your mass must be

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:14.039
200 pounds at the poles it'll guess that you're

00:11:14.769 --> 00:11:18.239
199 at the equator. The 9.8

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:24.690
Multiplier used so often in physics is calculated based on how these factors affect someone at 45 degrees latitude

00:11:25.209 --> 00:11:30.419
all of these influences on the direction of down result in a total vertical deflection.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:34.769
That's only ever at most a few arc seconds anywhere on earth

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:41.820
That's not enough to be felt, but changes in direction and strength can be used to study the shape of the seafloor

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:47.370
Determine what's under you or even help you discover ancient buried rooms?

00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:53.969
Point is all of our downs aren't a bunch of radially symmetric lines

00:11:54.579 --> 00:11:57.029
Down is an uncombed mess.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:03.240
Now since solids don't flow they can have shapes that don't pay much mind to this but water can

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:11.249
Flow so ignoring influences like wind and tides the surface of oceans and lakes and puddles is always perpendicular

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:17.070
To down if water could pass through land, or if earth were submerged in water

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.419
Gravity would be the same everywhere along its bumpy surface

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:26.250
Such a surface is called a geoid and can be drawn at any altitude

00:12:26.709 --> 00:12:32.459
If you wanted to build a table that completely enclosed the earth it would have to have rolling undulation

00:12:32.459 --> 00:12:35.339
Z' nearly 100 meters at some points in order to be

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:39.629
Level so that a ball placed anywhere on it wouldn't roll

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.620
Here is Earth's G. I exaggerated a thousand times

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:48.180
You'd weigh about a hundredth of a percent less a few grams here?

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:53.909
Then you would say here where gravity is a bit stronger point is the strength and direction

00:12:54.259 --> 00:12:58.728
Down is variable by location and changes over time

00:12:59.489 --> 00:13:04.279
So down is a fluctuating vector easy enough except?

00:13:04.739 --> 00:13:08.539
Why should matter attract matter in the first place?

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:13.759
Isaac Newton was able to describe attraction, but not explain it

00:13:14.369 --> 00:13:19.369
humanity got closer however when Albert Einstein introduced his general theory of relativity

00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:23.988
Einstein thought a lot about the fact that everything falls to the ground

00:13:24.329 --> 00:13:26.508
At the same rate no matter

00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:33.108
How massive something is when dropped it will accelerate towards the earth down gaining about 9.8

00:13:33.109 --> 00:13:37.249
Meters per second for every second that it falls. That means that a hammer

00:13:37.589 --> 00:13:44.628
That's quite massive, and a not so massive feather when dropped from the same height will hit the ground at the same time

00:13:47.819 --> 00:13:49.819
Okay, what just happened...

00:13:50.279 --> 00:13:51.989
was an "air"ror.

00:13:51.989 --> 00:13:53.039
awkward laugh

00:13:53.039 --> 00:13:56.389
In order to fall through air a thing has to push air out of the way

00:13:56.549 --> 00:14:01.759
But if it has a large surface area and a low weight force it will have a lot of air to move

00:14:01.889 --> 00:14:07.279
But won't be able to move that air very quickly. In a vacuum, things do fall at the same rate regardless

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:12.940
Of mass. This was famously demonstrated by Apollo 15 commander David Scott on the moon

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:18.660
And I'll, uh, drop the two of them here and hopefully, they'll hit the ground at the same time.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.260
How 'bout that?

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:26.340
That's weird right? I mean if a more massive object is pulled with a greater force

00:14:27.149 --> 00:14:30.589
Shouldn't it fall faster? Well Newton's explanation was simple:

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:34.160
Larger masses are attracted with greater forces

00:14:34.589 --> 00:14:39.438
But will also require more force to be accelerated the same as a less massive thing

00:14:39.899 --> 00:14:46.008
Something a hundred times more massive might require a hundred times the force, but it will be pulled by gravity

00:14:46.769 --> 00:14:51.769
100 times more so everything falls to earth at the same rate

00:14:52.499 --> 00:14:54.499
What a fun coincidence right?

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.739
Maybe not

00:14:58.739 --> 00:15:02.749
Einstein realized that there's another way for things to appear to fall together

00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:05.399
of their masses

00:15:05.399 --> 00:15:12.888
Imagine a feather and a hammer floating in space in a room if the room is suddenly accelerated up at 9.8

00:15:13.319 --> 00:15:18.079
M/s^2 the feather and the hammer will hit the floor at the same time

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:24.319
furthermore whether it's the room coming up to meet them or gravity being suddenly switched on

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.919
Neither object will feel any force pushing them

00:15:28.079 --> 00:15:33.318
There's no way to tell which of these happen. This is Einstein's famous

00:15:34.019 --> 00:15:35.399
equivalence principle

00:15:35.399 --> 00:15:39.618
He once admitted that his greatest thought ever was that of a man

00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:42.439
falling off of a roof

00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:48.558
While falling the man would not feel any forces on him even though. He's speeding up

00:15:49.529 --> 00:15:50.910
freefall is

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:57.290
Indistinguishable from floating alone in space from having no forces on you from not being moved

00:15:57.689 --> 00:16:03.558
What if gravity isn't a force at all what if things fall not because they're being pushed or pulled

00:16:03.809 --> 00:16:07.789
But because they're not being pushed or pull

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:12.619
To see how this could be we need to talk about straight lines

00:16:13.649 --> 00:16:17.388
What I have here is a retractable ID badge holder

00:16:17.489 --> 00:16:20.209
This is a great way to test for straight paths

00:16:20.699 --> 00:16:24.168
Because the string is always kept taut the card

00:16:24.169 --> 00:16:26.749
I have behind has two lines drawn on it

00:16:26.749 --> 00:16:32.058
And if while I pull the string out it always stays between those two lines

00:16:32.059 --> 00:16:34.459
I will know that I never turned

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:40.699
While I pulled it because any turn will translate into a different angle between the lines on the card and the string

00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:47.178
Now if I put two of these on a flat table and pull them out, always ensuring that they go straight ahead

00:16:47.399 --> 00:16:55.128
They will never meet. They will be forever parallel, but now let's put them on a sphere a curved surface

00:16:55.799 --> 00:17:02.119
Again, I pull both strings forward making sure that they always are pulled out straight. No turning

00:17:03.059 --> 00:17:05.059
Wait they came together

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.309
Well, they didn't turn look

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:15.840
Maybe there's some kind of weird force that pulled my hands together and just like gravity. I didn't feel it, but it happened

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:17.560
No

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:22.440
What happened was not the result of a force it was just a natural result of?

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:29.970
Curvature you might be thinking wait a second are those really straight lines. I mean they don't look that straight to me

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:37.500
Also, what if they've just moved along latitude lines then they've never come together and those look pretty darn straight

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:45.509
But they're not a straight line never turns and although latitude lines look straight at first glance

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.270
following one requires

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:54.149
Turning to find straight line paths on surfaces whether they're flat like this or curved

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:58.319
I love the ribbon test. Now you can use an actual ribbon

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:04.169
But I have found that a strip of paper works. Even better. Let's take a look at this path right here

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:10.319
It's straight at first, but then it curves now if two people are traveling along this curve

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:16.080
And they want to stay together the person on the inside will have to cover a shorter distance than the person on the outside

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:20.429
Since both sides of this strip of paper cannot change their lengths

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:25.409
They'll help us find a straight path if the strip of paper can lay flat

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.889
We'll know that we have found a straight line and as you can see

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.789
The strip can lay flat and follow the straight part of this path

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:36.150
But when it comes to the curve in order to follow the path now

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:40.169
The strip well it has too much material on the inside and that material

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:46.409
Bunches up and leaves the plane therefore we know that this part of the path is not straight

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:52.199
Let's use the ribbon test to find straight lines on the surface of a cone

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:58.889
Well from the looks of it aligned directly from the base to the tip seems like it would be straight and sure enough

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:04.199
Yeah, the ribbon lays flat on that path, but what about a ring around the cone?

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:11.460
Nope doesn't work shorter distances around nearer the tip of the cone mean that there's too much ribbon up at the top

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.180
So doesn't lay flat

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:19.469
Let's see what else is there though besides this well if I start here and just allow the ribbon

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.690
to lay flat

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:26.370
Huh I get a little curvy looking shape like this

00:19:26.429 --> 00:19:32.759
I say curvy looking because while to someone say at the base this path might seem to go up

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:39.780
Slow down change direction and then fall down faster and faster since a ribbon on such a path is flat

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.530
It's actually for inhabitants on the cones surface

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:48.059
Perfectly straight if we trace the ribbons path on to the cone

00:19:48.059 --> 00:19:55.139
We can see this clearly because a cone can be flattened a straight line on a curved surface is called a geodesic

00:19:56.530 --> 00:20:00.929
Here is a geodesic on a sphere the Equator is one

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:05.369
Here's another a line of latitude is not a geodesic

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:09.479
It's not a straight line to see why let's try to follow it with the ribbon you

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:13.140
Know what I have to keep kind of lifting it

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:17.429
Yeah, see distances around the sphere becomes shorter as we go up

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.800
So there's too much material on the ribbon up here

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:24.629
and it leaves the surface this path contains turns and in order to turn a

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.749
Force has to act on you if no forces

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:34.619
Did this is the path you would take notice that the ribbon begins moving due east, but then falls

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:37.350
south

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:39.390
Falls

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:44.550
Einstein realized that curvature could cause things to be seemingly attracted to one another

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.720
Without needing to invent the existence of forces like gravity

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:56.189
but attraction only happens if things move along the surface if they stay still they

00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:02.370
Well, they don't come together so for something at rest. How does falling begin?

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:07.920
I mean the thing has to move in this direction, but it's at rest right well

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.490
Yes

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:14.189
But it's only at rest in space and that's not the whole story up down

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:22.469
Forward backward and left-right are all you need to describe where an event occur but a complete description will also need to describe

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:28.559
When together these four dimensions form the setting in which everything in our universe happens

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.660
Space-time

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:38.790
Since we can talk about a falling pencil using just one spatial dimension up and down we can use a piece of paper to model

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:43.109
Space-time for it. Okay, so we've got up and down, but we have to add another

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.460
direction the pencil moves in

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:46.300
time

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.339
Now if no forces act on the pencil it won't move through space

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:54.840
It will only get older and as you can see if all it does is get older

00:21:54.840 --> 00:22:00.030
It won't fall if space-time was flat when I let go of the pencil

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:07.650
it wouldn't go anywhere, but now let's allow the earth which is massive to manipulate space-time into say a

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:09.190
cone

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:13.980
Now with no forces acting on it every part of the pencil follows a straight line

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:20.610
But on a cone as we saw earlier such a path will look like this it will fall

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:24.900
This is because distances around the cone are shorter higher up

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:29.429
Time runs faster further from a massive object, but to go straight

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:34.079
Not turn every part of the pencil must cover an equal distance in space-time

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:36.190
like this

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:43.290
Only when the pencil hits the earth does the repulsion of their mutual electrons provide a force pushing the pencil off a geodesic

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:49.949
For the earth time is a series of slices from this evolution the pencils force-free

00:22:50.259 --> 00:22:57.869
Geodesic is why it falls not a push or pull just the pencils natural tendency to follow a straight line

00:22:58.149 --> 00:23:04.349
Until something acts on it now. We only used one dimension of space and one of time because

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:11.639
Visualizing our universes three of space and one of time would take us beyond the limits of what could be shown on paper or screens

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.389
but math

00:23:13.389 --> 00:23:15.159
Can take us there

00:23:15.159 --> 00:23:18.809
General relativity allows us to calculate how much mass and energy

00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:26.399
Curved space-time and has been used to explain things that Newton's older theory of falling as the result of

00:23:26.649 --> 00:23:34.378
Forces couldn't like anomalies in the orbit of mercury which orbits nearest the Sun and is therefore most affected by the sun's grip on

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:41.309
space-time many other experiments have confirmed general relativity's picture of the universe fitting the conclusion that

00:23:42.009 --> 00:23:44.009
There is no

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.620
Gravity there's just

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:52.400
Space-time its curvature and a us in it. As John Wheeler famously put it

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:59.760
Space-time grips mass telling it how to move mass grips space-time telling it how to curve?

00:24:00.669 --> 00:24:07.439
Relative to the earth we don't move very fast even jet airplanes move negligibly close to the speed of light

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.589
So relative to earth we move almost

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:17.549
Exclusively through time as such we are more affected by the way time is curved by mass

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.659
Than how space is curved?

00:24:19.659 --> 00:24:24.869
This has led many to claim that for the most part you feel as though you're being pushed into the ground

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.419
Not because of a force called gravity

00:24:27.519 --> 00:24:33.449
But because time is moving faster for your head than for your feet down is

00:24:33.759 --> 00:24:41.249
Relative and always changing, but it exists because of and is always in the direction of slower time

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:45.839
Bertrand Russell called this the law of cosmic laziness

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:53.759
Everything is naturally steered towards where time is slowest we call this falling

00:24:54.429 --> 00:24:56.429
going down

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:59.849
So you don't have to keep anything on the down-low

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.689
time will take care of that for you and

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:06.490
and as always
