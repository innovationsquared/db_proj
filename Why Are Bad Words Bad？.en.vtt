00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.280
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.130
When you call customer service

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.370
and hear this "to ensure quality service

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.450
your call may be monitored or recorded",
they're not kidding.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.839
Over the last year the Marchex Institute
analysed more than 600,000

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.580
recorded phone conversations Americans made

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.100
to businesses in the United States.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.439
Turns out, people from Ohio were the most likely

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.679
to use curse words - the 'A' word, 
the 'F' word and the 'S' word.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.340
Washington state residents were
the least likely to use bad words.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.060
But what makes

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.550
a word bad?

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.300
Oh, be careful because etymologically speaking

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.510
even the word 'bad' can be considered a bad word.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.399
It began in old English as a derogatory term

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.579
for an effeminate man.
Eighty percent of swear words overheard

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.250
in public in 1986, 1997 and 2006

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.360
were essentially the same.
One third of all counts included

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.110
the top two - the 'F' word and the 'S' word.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.350
Slate's brilliant Lexicon Valley podcast purported that

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.220
these 10 words makeup about 0.7% of the average

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.110
English speakers daily vocabulary, which means

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.229
socially unacceptable words are used almost as often

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.729
as socially descriptive words.
First person plural pronouns account for about

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.309
1% of the words we say everyday.

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:37.000
When a bad word is bleeped, it is covered with a 1

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.509
kilohertz sine wave, which sounds like this.

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.249
Son of a ...

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.440
By the way, the symbols and
squiggles that are used to represent

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.079
a bad word have a name.
They're called grawlixes.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.699
They were named by Mort Walker in his seminal

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.860
"The Lexicon of Comicana." 
He names a lot of things but most of

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.040
them show stuff, they don't hide stuff.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.110
Why the need to hide bad words, especially if we all

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.300
pretty much know what's being said?
Well, there is no one single reason bad words

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.330
are bad.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.980
Steven Pinker in his excellent lecture
on the topic delineates

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.960
five types of swearing.
First of all, some words are bad

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.180
on purpose.
They are created and/or used with the intent

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.490
to hurt others.
He calls this "abusive swearing."

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.880
Using words to insult, humiliate, objectify

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.440
or marginalise disfavoured people.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.820
Now, if that this disfavoured person is

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.390
God, we're talking about supernatural swearing,

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.090
which was particularly taboo in Victorian times.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.620
It was believed that casually or vainly referring

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.830
to God would physically injure God himself,

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.440
literally. So, at the time people were
forced to come up with euphemisms,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.670
like "Zounds!" and "Gadzooks!", which  originally meant

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.180
"God's Wounds!" and "God's Hooks!",

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.970
referring to the nails driven through the hands of Jesus.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.540
Historically, swear words often
came from things we were

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.700
afraid of, things we perceived as dangerous,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.450
stronger than us and mercurial. Such as

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.740
death, disease and infirmity, sex

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.480
and sexually transmitted diseases,
as well as body fluids,

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.550
germy, gross effluvia. Words

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.080
for those gross things became gross
and bad in and of themselves,

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.609
uncouth

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.270
to speak.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.580
But not all words for gross things are

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.630
socially unacceptable, which brings us to Pinker's

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.270
second type of swearing - emphatic swearing.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.260
Emphatic swearing is where the
taboo-ness of bad words

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.700
becomes quite practical.
You wouldn't usually use those words but when you

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.470
really want to convey that your current
emotions matter more to you than proper

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.610
social conduct,

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.330
you can use them.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.480
Dysphemism.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.350
A euphemism is kind, acceptable word
that allows you to talk about something

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.280
unpleasant

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.980
while simultaneously letting everyone know you totally

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.640
get that it's unpleasant and want to respect that.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.290
For instance, if you want to be
professional, you wouldn't say s***.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.390
You might say 'defecate'. If, on the other hand,
you really want to drive home just

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.380
how unpleasant

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.460
the experience was, dysphemisms can help out a lot.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.140
It wasn't a bag of canine defecation you found on your

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.190
front porch, it was a s*** bag of hot

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.780
dog s***.
Both of these words refer to pretty much the same thing

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.440
but they have different levels of
social acceptability and that's

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.530
very helpful. It means word choice allows us to not only

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.100
refer to things in the real world but also

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.300
to how we feel about them.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.160
If both these words had the same level
of social acceptance

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.930
we might even have to find new, badder
words so as not to lose the power

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.900
language currently has to express

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.560
emotion,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.460
repulsion and disgust.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.729
But when it comes to two words
referring to the same thing, but

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.710
with different levels of social acceptance,
who decides which one's

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.110
good and which one's bad?
Well, historically, many of the bad words we

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.350
use today

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.250
are the result of class differences.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.360
In medieval England, the lower-class Saxons

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.550
spoke a Germanic tongue while the upper-class

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.090
Normans spoke a language related to French and Latin.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.220
English, as we know it today,
contains many consequences

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.190
of their differences. 
The lower class worked with animals and

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.699
from them we get animal names. The upper class

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:56.710
only ate the animals, which is where
the names of the meat

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.880
come from. Today's swear words

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.889
are similar.
Defecation stems from fancy pants

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:06.930
Latin, whereas the less classy s***

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.220
is Germanic. There's also idiomatic swearing,

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.740
where nothing is being emphasized.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.180
No dysphemism is meant;
instead, it's an easygoing type of

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.510
swearing that shows an atmosphere is casual.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.620
Bad words can be used,
we're all close here. It's okay to swear,

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.540
we're all cool.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.409
Cathartic swearing

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:32.860
is a bit different. It gives us "lalochezia,"

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.599
the medical term for the relief swearing provides

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:39.599
when you're in pain. In the brain, swearing

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:42.930
seems to involve different regions
than regular language,

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.680
which may explain why people with
aphasia caused by brain damage

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.560
struggle to comprehend or construct spoken words

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.590
but yet are fluent at swearing.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.780
Or why people with coprolalia control

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.130
normal language just fine, but involuntarily utter

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.530
profanity, an obscene words.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.000
It turns out

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.460
swearing may be centralized in the limbic system,

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.940
along with the motions.
Many animals make automatic

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.060
noises when in pain or threat to startle or intimidate

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.400
attackers, or to let others know what's going on.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.419
In humans, bad words are great for this purpose.

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:26.130
Their taboo-ness makes them special.
People wouldn't use them otherwise,

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.159
so they are great alarms. Swearing

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:33.889
is changing.
Some bad words are being used more and more

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:38.520
frequently. Of the seven words, George
Carlin said you could never say on

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.490
television.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.590
Today, every second

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.169
22 of them are sent out on Twitter.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.159
So, what will swearing look like in the future?

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:53.690
It probably won't go away altogether, it's too useful.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.360
But the words we don't like will likely change.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.089
History has shown that as disease
becomes less scary and sex and the

00:08:02.089 --> 00:08:03.080
supernatural

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.240
more personal, words related to them 
become less taboo

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.889
and more common; 
whereas words that were common in the past

00:08:11.889 --> 00:08:15.779
are increasingly unpleasant. Perhaps, in the future,

00:08:15.779 --> 00:08:19.409
spurt not by runaway political correctness but by wider

00:08:19.409 --> 00:08:23.810
knowledge, words like "schizo", "mental",

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:28.500
"aspy", or even "depressed" will take the square stage.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.860
Or as John McWhorter ventured,
words centered around class and the gap

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:33.380
between

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.579
opportunity and disadvantage will become more

00:08:36.579 --> 00:08:40.140
taboo. Salt of the Earth, trash,

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.459
chav, pikey, urban as a pejorative.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.720
When McKay Hatch started a "No Cussing Club"

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:51.810
at his school, his campaign became the
target of so many online jokes and

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:56.209
insults for being lame or anti-free speech.

00:08:56.209 --> 00:08:59.570
On his book, he literally subtitled his own name

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:03.730
"the most cyberbullied kid in the world."

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:07.730
People care about this stuff.
Is it censorship

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:11.160
to tell us what we can and cannot say or

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.870
is it a safety seal, ensuring certain
dysphemisms don't get worn down to a

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:16.829
quotidian

00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:19.369
bluntness like every other word?

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.699
Or is that badness of bad words a

00:09:23.699 --> 00:09:26.959
boundary, a moving boundary of we

00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:30.020
reject - sometimes arbitrary,

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:34.900
sometimes irrational, but always moving
in the direction of acceptance

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.150
moving forward?

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.290
Crime and inequality have existed ever since

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:46.819
they could. But when N.W.A released a
reaction, in the form of a song with bad

00:09:46.819 --> 00:09:48.050
word in the title,

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:52.569
"F*** the Police",
the Federal Bureau of Investigations released

00:09:52.569 --> 00:09:57.020
a statement against the song.
It was the only time,

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:01.339
up until then and since,
the FBI has ever issued an official statement

00:10:01.339 --> 00:10:04.390
about a work of art.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.689
Bad words have power.

00:10:07.689 --> 00:10:11.319
If you wanna push for change you'll need something

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:15.100
to push. If everything's fine,

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.380
nothing's cool.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.800
So, bad words are the precipitate of a larger

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:26.300
reaction - the process of us slowly becoming

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.340
what we want to become.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.980
That's some deep s***.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.590
And as always,

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:33.750
 thanks for watching.
