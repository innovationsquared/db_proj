Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
Music.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.640
Why does music make us feel the way it does?

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.670
Why does music make us wanna move?

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.530
And why do songs sometimes gets stuck in our heads?

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.460
James May, from the YouTube channel Head Squeeze,

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.960
thanks for the music. Pleasure.
Why can music bring back memories?

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.990
That is a very good question actually.
I've often wondered why it has this power

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.930
actually to unlock a completely dormant
memory, something that's gone as far as you

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:33.460
know

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.809
and then it chooses, usually a pop tune
from say ten or twenty years ago,

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.760
bang, there you are, wherever you were at the time.
Sometimes it's positive,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.170
sometimes it's negative,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.210
but what is nostalgia?

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.170
Well, it turns out that nostalgia and

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.530
feeling emotions because of music and dancing

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.690
and getting songs stuck in your head

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.730
all orbit around a common theme.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.979
Your identity.
Because, really, physically speaking,

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.700
who are you? Every single day

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.070
you are losing atoms and gaining new ones
from what you eat and drink.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.790
It takes about five years to replace
every atom in your body,

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.899
which means that the matter that we call you today

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:26.440
was not part of you five years ago.
If we speed the process up we start to see

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.229
that your physical body,

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.590
really all of us, every human on earth,

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.899
is just a temporary group of atoms and
molecules that, nonetheless,

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.270
keep the same name the whole time.
Now this is what we think of when we think

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.289
of our bodies,

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.520
but to an alien, who could track individual atoms,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.700
and only saw maybe a few frames per decade,
you would appear to be what you really

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.890
are.
A bunch of incoming atoms,

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.509
making your shape and then leaving.

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.729
So, what's consistent here?
What are you?

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.890
Nostalgia, fondly remembering the past, what you

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.619
used to do and who used to be might
simply be a way for your brain

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.470
to answer that question or at least cool
down the anxieties it causes.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.270
Because even at a macroscopic scale,
you are always changing.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.090
You have different friends,
different behaviors, different moods, different

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.770
tastes

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.950
all the time.
If you grew up

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.069
in the 80s, and by that I mean 1680s,

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.370
it would have been possible to have been
nostalgic for a time

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.819
before the word nostalgia existed.

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.940
That's because in 1688 Johannes Hofer coined the term

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.440
by combining the Greek words for returning home

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.430
and pain. Nostalgia was originally seen
as a quite serious medical condition,

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.540
affecting soldiers who missed home so much

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.360
that they broke down and were unable to
fulfil their duties.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.500
The only cure, as Hofer saw it, was to

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.710
be sent home, to your home,

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.910
because nostalgia is really all about you.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.790
Your memories, your past, who you used to be

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.520
and consequently who you are now, which
makes nostalgia an often healthy way to

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.760
answer the question

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.750
'who am I?' Well, you're a person who
remembers specific events in the past.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.490
You existed in the past and are a continuous

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.990
being. A popular theory argues that the
psychological effects of nostalgia,

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.970
connecting with your younger self and
building a continuous

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.760
identity, are advantageous,
and so we're naturally selected to be

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.950
rewarding experiences.
You change

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.100
your habits, your friends, your job,
you learn things and forget things,

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.360
but nostalgia allows you to connect all of those

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.280
events, which is especially helpful
during times of major life

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.550
transitions, like

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.880
entering adulthood or aging,
when study showed that nostalgia

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.270
is at its strongest. But if tucking in
and lining up all of your life experiences into

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.650
a continuous story

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.090
is so advantageous, why don't we feel nostalgic for

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.840
everything in the past?
Why don't you feel nostalgia for

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.160
what happened one minute ago?
Why don't you feel nostalgic for the way this

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.889
video began?
Well, the lifespan retrieval curve

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:35.020
might offer some clues. It's an average plot of distinct autobiographical memories

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.069
and it reveals what is called the reminiscence

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:43.699
bump. A time between 15 and 30 years of
the age, where more memories are encoded.

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.210
This time in your life, both while you
are living it and later,

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.530
is thought to be important because it's
so linked to the formation of our

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.000
self-identities.
Memories formed during that bump

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.660
tend to be the ones we are most nostalgic for

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.889
and because we want our continuous
identities to be positive,

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.080
we tend to be nostalgic for good memories,

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.460
not bad ones.
Individually and collectively we also tend to be

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.360
nostalgic and reminisce

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.610
on things as if they were better than at the time they

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.210
really were.
Twenty years after leaving his hometown

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.979
Abraham Lincoln returned to it and
looking upon it remembering it

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.449
nostalgically,

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.860
he wrote these lines of poetry.
"My childhood's home

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.909
I see again and saddened with the view

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:34.990
and still as memory crowds my brain,
there's pleasure

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.490
in it too."
Abraham Lincoln might seem like

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.129
a quite ancient person,
someone from way back in history.

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:46.389
But here's some perspective.
On February 9,

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:52.129
1956, a date within the lives of some of
our parents and many of our grandparents,

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:55.400
this old man appeared on the television show

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.969
"I've got a secret."
What made him so special?

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:02.759
Well, he was Samuel J. Seymour,

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.809
an eyewitness.
Goodnight, Mr. Seymour.
How old are you by the way, Sir?

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:11.849
Ninety six.
Ninety six years old.

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:15.309
He was allive and in attendance at
Ford's Theatre

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:19.629
on the very day Abraham Lincoln was assassinated.

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:23.279
And he was alive recently enough to have
appeared on national

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:27.639
television.
Music doesn't have to bring up old memories or

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:31.699
make you feel nostalgia in order to help
you build an identity.

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:35.779
Lawrence Parsons in a great interview
discusses the fact that babies

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:40.669
from about six months to one-year
clearly respond to all kinds of

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:41.189
different

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:45.189
rhythms and chords when only a single note or beat

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:48.759
is out of place.
But after one year

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:53.039
babies tend to only respond to rhythms and chords

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:56.759
from their own culture, from the world around them.

00:06:56.759 --> 00:07:00.229
This makes sense when you consider just
how important it is for our brains to

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:02.219
not only construct a continuous

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:06.939
individual identity, but a continuous
identity within the groups

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:10.710
that we belong.
We don't always get along with or

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:15.729
understand other people, but when two
people listen to and respond to

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:20.379
music, their feelings and emotions can
become more similar than if they were to

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:21.490
merely sit

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.979
in silence or use words with no rhythm.

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:29.490
So, although we are still not exactly
sure why music makes us wanna move,

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:33.599
the desire you have, the impulse you
have to tap your foot or

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:36.889
bob your head or, if confident enough, dance

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:40.969
when you hear a rhythm might have less
to do with the behavior you have learned

00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:45.749
and more to do with your internal desire

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:51.009
to fit it. And as a consequence of our
impressive ability to communicate and be

00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:51.869
social

00:07:51.869 --> 00:07:55.610
it even happens when you are alone or
when you want to

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.349
dance as if no one is watching.
Speaking of dance,

00:07:59.349 --> 00:08:03.839
William Michael Brown motion captured
good and bad dancers so he could render

00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:05.839
them into digital stick figures

00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:09.069
and remove all clues as to their fitness
or looks or health.

00:08:09.069 --> 00:08:12.729
Now, figures with symmetric movement, 
what we might call

00:08:12.729 --> 00:08:17.039
good dancing, were consistently rated
as more attractive

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:20.569
and more desirable as mates.

00:08:20.569 --> 00:08:25.469
But this may have less to do with music
being some special human behavior

00:08:25.469 --> 00:08:29.149
and more to do with communication in general.

00:08:29.149 --> 00:08:33.430
Sharing a musical experience with
someone else might just be an extreme

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:34.010
form

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.750
of the communication skills that were
naturally selected into us,

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:42.649
so that we could understand each other,
understand a motion from tone of voice

00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:46.210
and listen.
Sweet, fatty foods

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:50.470
taste good because they signal our brain
that they are full of energy.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.700
Energy that we need to survive.
This is why

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.520
cheesecake tastes so incredible.
But it doesn't mean that

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.580
cheesecake is necessary for survival.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.020
Music might be the same way.
A happy accident of

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.660
the communication skills we developed
but fundamentally

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:14.279
an unnecessary one or, as cognitive
scientist Steven Pinker famously called it,

00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:18.790
acoustic cheesecake.
If not properly chewed

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:23.019
a bite of cheesecake can get lodged in your throat.

00:09:23.019 --> 00:09:26.639
But a short repetitive song can get lodged

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:30.459
in your brain.
It's called an ear worm.

00:09:30.459 --> 00:09:34.350
At best it means that the song is catchy.
At worst

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:37.589
it means replaying over and

00:09:37.589 --> 00:09:40.730
over and over again the same song in
your head

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.870
until you are annoyed.
According to research by James Kellaris,

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.949
nearly all of us experience ear worms.

00:09:47.949 --> 00:09:52.079
Men and women experience them equally as
often but for reasons we don't quite

00:09:52.079 --> 00:09:53.550
understand yet

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:57.690
ear worms tend to last longer for and be more irritating

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:01.699
to women.
Repetitive rhythms make a song

00:10:01.699 --> 00:10:06.529
easier to reproduce in our heads and
unusual time signatures

00:10:06.529 --> 00:10:11.350
or unresolved or incomplete musical ideas.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:16.279
bother us. Perhaps because we strive to
communicate completely and clearly

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:20.970
so we fixate on these little snippets of
songs, replaying them over and over again

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.970
in our heads, hoping to resolve them,

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:26.850
which, of course, they don't, meaning that
they are quite literally a

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.769
cognitive itch.
An itch that that just gets worse

00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:34.529
by being scratched.
Our inability to suppress

00:10:34.529 --> 00:10:38.420
a simple thought, like the famous 
"quick, whatever you do,

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:42.410
don't think of a pink elephant" or

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:46.290
the game or a song stuck in your head

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.970
might be explained by ironic process theory.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:54.069
The idea that in our brains there are
two different processes going on.

00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:57.560
One, which consciously controls what we think about

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.870
and the other unconsciously monitoring

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:05.639
what we are thinking about.
They share an equal amount of cognitive effort and

00:11:05.639 --> 00:11:09.209
they're always in balance and so more
effort put into monitoring

00:11:09.209 --> 00:11:13.259
what you're thinking about means that
there's less left to actually control

00:11:13.259 --> 00:11:14.970
what you think about.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:19.310
Spending that cognitive effort on some
other task that uses working memory like

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:20.339
Sudoku or

00:11:20.339 --> 00:11:24.750
anagrams can often help get
an ear worm out of your head.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:29.149
You can always just replace the ear worm
with another one, using a service like

00:11:29.149 --> 00:11:32.579
Unhear it[.com].
Ear worms are annoying,

00:11:32.579 --> 00:11:36.560
but music has the power to conjure up
all kinds of other emotions

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:41.759
when we hear it. A major reason for this
is the fact that, like our sense of smell,

00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:46.050
music is initially processed in the same
regions of the brain that process

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.459
memories and emotion, like the amygdala.

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:52.839
So, maybe those are

00:11:52.839 --> 00:11:58.310
answers - memories. You might not have the same friends and job and house and

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:01.660
atoms throughout your life,
but you do have the same memories,

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:06.449
so are you just your memories?

00:12:06.449 --> 00:12:10.360
Well, unfortunately, that idea is a little
troublesome, because

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:15.110
memory loss doesn't necessarily make you
a brand new different person

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.339
and there's also the slight problem of false

00:12:18.339 --> 00:12:22.139
memories.
These studies always freak me out.

00:12:22.139 --> 00:12:25.660
Researchers bring in participants and
show them photographs from their

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:26.620
childhood

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:31.509
and ask him to tell a story about what
happened in the photo,

00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:35.959
except one of the photos has been photoshopped.

00:12:35.959 --> 00:12:39.089
It didn't really happen.
But instead of noticing

00:12:39.089 --> 00:12:42.170
this fake image, people tend to just

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:47.210
make up a story and remember it as if it
really happened.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:53.480
Couple weeks ago I went with Jake Chudnow,
who does the music here on Vsauce

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.120
to the Royal Observatory

00:12:55.129 --> 00:12:58.759
in Greenwich.
We saw the seventh-largest telescope

00:12:58.759 --> 00:13:02.649
on earth and while there, this song

00:13:02.649 --> 00:13:06.699
was playing.
It's called "Longplayer."

00:13:06.699 --> 00:13:11.290
Composed by Jem Finer, Longplayer is
constructed by combining different

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.240
recordings of singing bells.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.519
They're combined in different ways,
so as to never repeat

00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:19.800
for 1,000 years.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.790
Longplayer began in 1999 and it will not finish,

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:27.610
the song will not be over for 1,000 years.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:31.850
Literally, billions of humans will be born

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:35.010
and die before Longplayer is

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:38.430
finished playing.
The sound waves,

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.850
the compression waves that send Longplayer into your

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.899
ear aren't that much unlike you,

00:13:44.899 --> 00:13:49.699
your waves of atoms, temporarily
organizing atoms or molecules but not

00:13:49.699 --> 00:13:52.930
really causing any one atom or molecule
to stay along with you

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:56.110
for the entire journey.
Just as the ocean

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:59.529
waves and bells ring, as Alan Watts said, the

00:13:59.529 --> 00:14:05.519
earth peoples. In a way, you are a slow
compression wave moving through

00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:08.940
Earth's matter.
But what is your waves sound like?

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.560
Does it make people wanna dance?
It probably won't

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.899
echo around for centuries after you're
gone, but maybe, while you are here, you

00:14:16.899 --> 00:14:17.829
can get

00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:21.920
stuck in the head of some other
temporary wave. An ear worm that they

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.790
like and don't want to get rid of.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.319
That'd be a nice type of wave to be.

00:14:27.319 --> 00:14:31.860
But can music make you smarter

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.180
and can I play an instrument?
Well,

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:39.490
to find out, follow James and I
over to the YouTube channel Headsqueeze,

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:43.449
where we take a look at those
questions. And as always,

00:14:43.449 --> 00:14:45.800
thanks for watching.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.250
Thank you.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.860
Seriously, follows us over. 
No, seriously. Right now.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.029
There's also a link I'll put in the description,
so it's like a piece of cake guys. Come

00:15:03.029 --> 00:15:03.230
on.

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:07.410
Well, we'll be over there waiting.
He's over there, I'm over there, I'm with him

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:08.769
here and he's with me over there.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.180
We won.
