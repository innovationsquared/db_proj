00:01:36.328,00:01:37.730,"and how we form them."
00:01:37.763,00:01:42.502,"Specifically beliefs about what causes our behavior."

00:01:48.841,00:01:51.677,"Well, a Skinner Box is a great place to start."
00:01:51.710,00:01:54.180,"because what I tell my students is,"

00:01:57.216,00:01:59.385,"is like a test tube for a chemist."

00:02:01.754,00:02:05.458,"<i> I'm getting ready to  demonstrate a fundamental  principle of behavior.</i>"
00:02:05.491,00:02:08.361,"Michael: <i> Invented by Harvard  psychologist B.F. Skinner,</i>"
00:02:08.394,00:02:11.164,"<i> a Skinner Box is a chamber  in which animals</i>"

00:02:16.802,00:02:19.338,"<i> Skinner released food  to pigeons in the boxes</i>"

00:02:20.973,00:02:22.842,"<i> What he found was that  the pigeons seemed to believe</i>"

00:02:24.443,00:02:25.912,"<i> just before the food came</i>"
00:02:25.945,00:02:28.281,"<i> actually</i> caused<i> the food  to appear,</i>"
00:02:28.314,00:02:30.516,"<i> and would then repeat  that behavior over and over--</i>"
00:02:30.549,00:02:34.320,"<i> for example, hopping around  or spinning in circles.</i>"
00:02:34.353,00:02:38.291,"<i> Skinner called this  ""superstitious behavior.""</i>"
00:02:38.324,00:02:42.895,"So what do you want to do-- what's your dream test?"
00:02:42.928,00:02:46.966,"Basically a replication of Skinner's superstitious experiment,"
00:02:46.999,00:02:48.968,"but instead of with pigeons, with people."
00:02:49.001,00:02:51.904,"I would love to see: will people develop"
00:02:51.937,00:02:55.675,"their own sort of superstitious rituals or beliefs."
00:02:55.708,00:02:57.910,"Have we done this with people before?"
00:02:57.943,00:03:01.747,"I don't think such a rigorous test of this has been done."
00:03:01.780,00:03:05.318,"I think primarily, from the literature I know, it's pretty much pigeons."
00:03:09.755,00:03:12.225,"B.F. Skinner's work showed that if you"
00:03:12.258,00:03:14.627,"regularly deliver a reward to a pigeon,"
00:03:14.660,00:03:16.596,"regardless of how it actually acts,"
00:03:16.629,00:03:18.564,"the pigeon won't figure that out."
00:03:18.597,00:03:22.568,"Instead, the pigeon will develop superstitious behaviors"
00:03:22.601,00:03:24.904,"as if it thinks it is in control,"
00:03:24.937,00:03:27.306,"despite the lack of any evidence that it is."

00:18:23.801,00:18:26.271,"<i> Now, I'm watching hidden  cameras that we have</i>"
00:18:26.304,00:18:28.406,"<i> in the exam room  adjacent to us.</i>"
00:18:28.439,00:18:33.612,"Let's see what sorts of altered states of consciousness we can create today."
00:18:33.645,00:18:37.415,"<i> Now, this is Jeremiah,  and Jeremiah's been waiting  for about an hour.</i>"
00:18:37.448,00:18:39.784,"Actor/Nurse: <i> So I'm gonna be  placing this on your head.</i>"
00:18:39.817,00:18:43.188,"It's called an EEG cap, it just measures"
00:18:43.221,00:18:46.291,"<i> your brain activity.</i>"
00:18:46.324,00:18:48.260,"This is a really important part of selling"
00:18:48.293,00:18:51.563,"the scientific realness of what we're doing."
00:18:51.596,00:18:53.899,"Jeremiah, very pleased to meet you."
00:18:53.932,00:18:55.534,"Thank you so much for coming."
00:18:55.567,00:18:57.402,"<i> Thank you so much again  for your patience.</i>"
00:18:57.435,00:18:59.604,"I think it's really important for Veissiére to talk about"
00:18:59.637,00:19:01.606,"how what's about to happen is special,"
00:19:01.639,00:19:03.608,"it's not a normal ritual."
00:19:03.641,00:19:06.511,"In fact, it's not a ritual that any lay people really know about yet."
00:19:06.544,00:19:08.680,"So the name of the study, it's a bit of a mouthful,"
00:19:08.713,00:19:11.716,"so we're looking at neural correlates and physiologic markers"
00:19:11.749,00:19:14.719,"of ritually induced mystical experiences."
00:19:14.752,00:19:16.821,"<i> I have run this experiment  about 30 times,</i>"
00:19:16.854,00:19:18.456,"and some people enter"
00:19:18.489,00:19:20.559,"<i> some kind of encounter with</i>"
00:19:20.592,00:19:23.195,"<i> what they may call  a divine presence.</i>"
00:19:23.228,00:19:25.497,"- Jeremiah: How's it goin'? - Michael:<i> Here comes  </i> the priest."
00:19:25.530,00:19:27.599,"- I'm Jeremiah. Nice to meet you, sir.  - Father Callahan."
00:19:27.632,00:19:30.669,"""Father Callahan,"" the Stephen King character."
00:19:30.702,00:19:32.904,"OK, we might have to change that."
00:19:32.937,00:19:35.707,"Actor/Priest:<i> Jeremiah,  what I'd like you to do...</i>"
00:19:35.740,00:19:40.445,"is relax, and I'd like you just to casually stare"
00:19:40.478,00:19:42.914,"at the crucifix, in the center."
00:19:42.947,00:19:45.217,"Michael:<i> We had our ""priest""  guide Jeremiah</i>"
00:19:45.250,00:19:46.751,"<i> through a holy ritual</i>"
00:19:46.784,00:19:49.321,"<i> which we told him  was a thousand years old.</i>"
00:19:49.354,00:19:52.424,"<i> But in actuality,  Dr. Veissiére wrote it himself</i>"
00:19:52.457,00:19:55.594,"<i> just before the demonstration.</i>"
00:19:55.627,00:19:57.329," Actor/Priest: <i> And you may feel a tendency</i>"
00:19:57.362,00:20:00.365,"<i> that you want to  let your hands raise</i>"
00:20:00.398,00:20:02.634,"towards the sky as your body falls away."
00:20:02.667,00:20:05.870,"Michael:<i> Getting someone  to literally act possessed</i>"
00:20:05.903,00:20:09.474,"<i> is definitely a difficult test  of the placebo effect,</i>"
00:20:09.507,00:20:12.410,"<i> so I'm not exactly sure  what kind of results  we can expect.</i>"
00:20:12.443,00:20:14.679,"<i> However, I'm at least hoping  that we learn from this</i>"
00:20:14.712,00:20:17.249,"<i> how to better tap into  the power of people's beliefs.</i>"
00:20:17.282,00:20:18.883," Actor/Priest:<i> Whatever  the spirit needs to speak,</i>"
00:20:18.916,00:20:20.485,"it will speak."
00:20:24.555,00:20:27.659,"So now, as you keep relaxing, as the spirit prepares..."
00:20:27.692,00:20:30.929,"<i> Jeremiah sat very still  during the whole ritual,</i>"
00:20:30.962,00:20:33.465,"<i> but we were curious  about what he experienced.</i>"
00:20:33.498,00:20:34.733,"So what did that feel like?"
00:20:34.766,00:20:36.334,"Jeremiah:  <i> It was weird,</i>"
00:20:36.367,00:20:38.036,"<i> but I could feel like  the presence,</i>"
00:20:38.069,00:20:39.804,"it's a little graphic,"
00:20:39.837,00:20:42.474,"if some, like, cut my head off."
00:20:42.507,00:20:45.577,"-<i> I didn't feel anything below. </i> -<i> Right.</i>"
00:20:45.610,00:20:47.579,"Michael:<i> People don't normally  have feelings</i>"
00:20:47.612,00:20:49.614,"<i> of decapitation and numbness,</i>"
00:20:49.647,00:20:52.417,"<i> so either we've stumbled upon  a way to summon a spirit,</i>"
00:20:52.450,00:20:55.987,"<i> or our belief manipulation  is working.</i>"
00:20:56.020,00:20:57.789,"So we've been working together on this project,"
00:20:57.822,00:21:00.292,"and I was observing you from the other room."
00:21:00.325,00:21:03.595,"And there are two really powerful kinds of symbols in the room."
00:21:03.628,00:21:06.364,"Which one had the biggest kind of visceral effect on you?"
00:21:06.397,00:21:08.867,"I guess it was kind of a balance, because, like,"
00:21:08.900,00:21:11.936,"OK, it's religious, and the nurse comin' in,"
00:21:11.969,00:21:15.640,"science-- it kinda goes back and forth, so I want to say ""even."""
00:21:15.673,00:21:20.011,"Well, more has been going on than what you know at this moment."
00:21:20.044,00:21:23.081,"Joe--Father Callahan-- was not a priest."
00:21:23.114,00:21:24.949,"- Mm-hmm. - He's an actor,"
00:21:24.982,00:21:27.519,"and everything that he read was written by Dr. Veissiére."
00:21:27.552,00:21:32.457,"We're looking at how a thing that has no known causal link"
00:21:32.490,00:21:35.427,"to any particular reaction or behavior or feeling"
00:21:35.460,00:21:37.796,"can nonetheless induce a feeling."
00:21:37.829,00:21:41.066,"Michael: <i> Jeremiah's experience  was pretty curious,</i>"
00:21:41.099,00:21:45.003,"<i> and since  nothing too serious happened--  his head didn't spin around--</i>"
00:21:45.036,00:21:50.075,"<i> we felt more comfortable  pushing things a bit further.</i>"
00:21:50.108,00:21:52.711,"I'm the lead behavioral scientist in charge of the experiment,"
00:21:52.744,00:21:54.746,"this is my colleague Dr. Stevens."
00:21:54.779,00:21:57.115,"Michael:<i> First, I interacted  with the participants</i>"
00:21:57.148,00:21:59.918,"<i> before the ritual,  to build up their expectation</i>"
00:21:59.951,00:22:03.555,"<i> of something happening--  like...possession.</i>"
00:22:03.588,00:22:08.660,"So today, you will be listening to a reverse exorcism."
00:22:08.693,00:22:13.131,"- OK. - I'm already possessed.  I'm already possessed."
00:22:13.164,00:22:15.533,"Michael:<i> We also decided  to dim the lights</i>"
00:22:15.566,00:22:18.870,"<i> to decrease their inhibitions  and increase the atmosphere.</i>"
00:22:18.903,00:22:21.573," Michael:<i> I think it's gonna be  great for our participants  and for the whole mood.</i>"
00:22:21.606,00:22:23.708,"I mean, it's spooky stuff."
00:22:23.741,00:22:26.010,"Before you can fully experience the divine,"
00:22:26.043,00:22:29.013,"I'll simply just invite you to kind of relax..."
00:22:29.046,00:22:30.849,"Michael:<i> And we decided  to have Dr. Veissiére</i>"
00:22:30.882,00:22:32.717,"<i> lead the ritual  instead of our ""priest,""</i>"
00:22:32.750,00:22:34.119,"<i> so that he could use</i>"
00:22:34.152,00:22:36.020,"<i> his training  in behavioral psychology</i>"
00:22:36.053,00:22:37.989,"<i> to harness  the power of suggestion.</i>"
00:22:38.022,00:22:39.657,"<i> The priest continued to serve</i>"
00:22:39.690,00:22:41.559,"<i> as an important religious  anchor point</i>"
00:22:41.592,00:22:42.961,"<i> for the subject to focus on.</i>"
00:22:42.994,00:22:45.463,"Veissiére: All of your actions and reactions"
00:22:45.496,00:22:47.465,"gradually fade and disappear"
00:22:47.498,00:22:50.369,"as your body is now approaching the divine."
00:22:51.569,00:22:53.138,"You may notice..."
00:22:53.171,00:22:56.107,"your fingers tingling a little."
00:22:56.140,00:22:59.544,"You may feel your mouth... needing to tweak a little."
00:23:03.681,00:23:07.452,"Her mouth is opening... slowly."
00:23:07.485,00:23:11.589,"As the divine  tries to speak through you,"
00:23:11.622,00:23:13.825,"<i> filling your mouth, perhaps,</i>"
00:23:13.858,00:23:16.395,"gently, ever so slowly."
00:23:17.795,00:23:20.698,"You are now awake."
00:23:20.731,00:23:22.600,"Good."
00:23:22.633,00:23:24.869,"Michael: <i> When the ritual ended,</i>"
00:23:24.902,00:23:27.806,"<i> each of our participants  had something very interesting  to report.</i>"
00:23:27.839,00:23:29.641,"He did definitely have an aura around him--"
00:23:29.674,00:23:31.009,"the Father."
00:23:31.042,00:23:33.011,"Woman: <i> I could feel just</i>"
00:23:33.044,00:23:36.915,"this everlasting joy and peace of God just covering me."
00:23:36.948,00:23:40.185,"There was like a glowing figure, man,"
00:23:40.218,00:23:43.588,"and then the cross was like right in front of me."
00:23:43.621,00:23:45.223,"We've got medical science"
00:23:45.256,00:23:49.127,"and we've got ancient religious symbols."
00:23:49.160,00:23:51.729,"And what we're specifically looking at"
00:23:51.762,00:23:56.034,"is how the accessories play into your expectations."
00:23:56.067,00:23:58.803,"I liked the visual part. I didn't like the audio part."
00:23:58.836,00:24:00.605,"- Interesting. - I wasn't connecting with it."
00:24:00.638,00:24:03.842,"Woman 2: I've always thought that the kind of traditional,"
00:24:03.875,00:24:06.611,"ritualistic parts of church, they just never appealed to me."
00:24:06.644,00:24:09.047,"I think it was more the symbols that was more comforting,"
00:24:09.080,00:24:11.115,"because that's just the way I was raised."
00:24:11.148,00:24:15.553,"Michael: <i> One of the most intriguing  was our final subject, Miriam.</i>"
00:24:15.586,00:24:17.121,"What was it like for you?"
00:24:17.154,00:24:19.257,"Um, I went to another place."
00:24:19.290,00:24:20.959,"OK, OK."
00:24:20.992,00:24:24.762,"I immediately felt my mother's-- her spirit with me,"
00:24:24.795,00:24:26.231,"<i> she was telling me...</i>"
00:24:26.264,00:24:28.099,"- ...to come towards her. - OK."
00:24:28.132,00:24:30.802,"And when I got close to her, she was comforting me."
00:24:30.835,00:24:34.239,"- OK. - Um, and I heard an angel say,"
00:24:34.272,00:24:36.674,"""I'm here with you. I will never leave you."""
00:24:36.707,00:24:40.678,"<i> And I continued to see wings.</i>"
00:24:40.711,00:24:42.814,"- Wings. Interesting. - Yes."
00:24:42.847,00:24:45.650,"Michael:<i> Miriam's experience  seemed to have</i>"
00:24:45.683,00:24:47.652,"<i> a profound effect on her,</i>"
00:24:47.685,00:24:51.055,"<i> but I wanted to hear more about  what exactly happened to her.</i>"
00:24:51.088,00:24:52.757,"When you say that you saw things,"
00:24:52.790,00:24:55.126,"describe for me what that was."
00:24:55.159,00:24:59.964,"Was it like a daydream, or was it more like, um, really there?"
00:24:59.997,00:25:01.833,"It was extremely vivid."
00:25:01.866,00:25:05.603,"Um, I could feel the wind when it started going across,"
00:25:05.636,00:25:08.706,"I could vividly see my mother standing there, smiling at me."
00:25:08.739,00:25:10.975,"- She looked beautiful. - Wow."
00:25:11.008,00:25:14.612,"Michael:<i> The fact that Miriam  had an out-of-body experience</i>"
00:25:14.645,00:25:17.782,"<i> and saw her deceased mother,  was almost puzzling,</i>"
00:25:17.815,00:25:20.985,"<i> because everything we did  in the room was a lie.</i>"
00:25:21.018,00:25:23.254,"<i> The priest was not real,</i>"
00:25:23.287,00:25:25.623,"<i> the ritual was not  a thousand years old,</i>"
00:25:25.656,00:25:28.760,"<i> the nurse was an actress,  but yet Miriam's experience</i>"
00:25:28.793,00:25:32.030,"<i> and those of the other  participants</i> were<i> real.</i>"
00:25:32.063,00:25:36.000,"The thing that surprised me the most today"
00:25:36.033,00:25:41.339,"was how personal every single moment was."
00:25:41.372,00:25:45.076,"I think because of a combination of the powerful imagery,"
00:25:45.109,00:25:47.312,"both religious and scientific,"
00:25:47.345,00:25:49.981,"it becomes the most powerful experience they've had."
00:25:50.014,00:25:52.750,"Even if you're a very staunch atheist,"
00:25:52.783,00:25:54.752,"a cross and a lectionary,"
00:25:54.785,00:25:56.254,"these things, they're pregnant with meaning."
00:25:56.287,00:25:59.257,"We seem to have found that by using those cues,"
00:25:59.290,00:26:01.993,"people were able to tune in very, very deeply,"
00:26:02.026,00:26:04.696,"and to relinquish their sense of self-control."
00:26:04.729,00:26:06.230,"Here's a question."
00:26:06.263,00:26:10.134,"What's the difference between what we did today"
00:26:10.167,00:26:15.039,"and what an actual priest can do?"
00:26:15.072,00:26:18.076,"That's a really controversial question."
00:26:18.109,00:26:21.379,"Um, I think the difference is that, unlike the priest,"
00:26:21.412,00:26:27.151,"we understand the mechanisms through a more psychological route,"
00:26:27.184,00:26:30.188,"whereas many priests may themselves be convinced"
00:26:30.221,00:26:32.890,"that they are facilitating communication with the divine."
00:26:32.923,00:26:34.926,"And perhaps they are."
00:26:34.959,00:26:37.295,"The results can be the same,"
00:26:37.328,00:26:40.865,"regardless of the intentions of the facilitators."
00:26:40.898,00:26:44.002,"There's no way to prove whether or not"
00:26:44.035,00:26:47.372,"God worked in this room today."
00:26:47.405,00:26:50.842,"I guess ultimately, with the tools of science, no, there isn't."
00:26:50.875,00:26:54.045,"These are still some really difficult philosophical questions."
00:26:58.916,00:27:01.419,"Michael: <i> So, we have demonstrated that</i>"
00:27:01.452,00:27:04.355,"our brains are belief-making machines."
00:27:04.388,00:27:08.092,"Rather than accepting confusion and uncertainty,"
00:27:08.125,00:27:10.795,"we create superstitions and beliefs"
00:27:10.828,00:27:14.699,"that make us feel like we have control over our lives."
00:27:14.732,00:27:17.935,"In fact, to<i> not</i> form a superstition"

00:27:20.938,00:27:22.674,"is to be powerless,"
00:27:22.707,00:27:26.911,"even when superstitions are unconnected to reality."
00:27:26.944,00:27:29.714,"That doesn't mean they can't be powerful."

00:27:32.383,00:27:35.720,"and its practitioners were all placebos."

00:27:39.290,00:27:42.760,"made them real and transformative."
00:27:42.793,00:27:46.297,"So does that make us all fools?"
