00:00:05.504,00:00:09.075,"Just kidding. My name is actually Michael."
00:00:09.108,00:00:11.644,"That part when I said that I was Vanessa..."
00:00:11.677,00:00:13.579,"that was a lie."
00:00:13.612,00:00:15.515,"So you're welcome."
00:00:15.548,00:00:18.117,"Humans love lies."
00:00:18.150,00:00:19.485,"More precisely,"
00:00:19.518,00:00:22.288,"we love things that aren't entirely true--"
00:00:22.321,00:00:23.756,"because we<i> have</i> to."
00:00:23.789,00:00:25.658,"It's often all we have."
00:00:25.691,00:00:28.161,"Completely proving something can be difficult,"
00:00:28.194,00:00:30.329,"if not impossible."
00:00:30.362,00:00:33.666,"So instead, we have the faith of the believer,"
00:00:33.699,00:00:36.636,"the confidence interval of the scientist."
00:00:36.669,00:00:38.738,"What we think we know,"
00:00:38.771,00:00:42.175,"we really only<i> believe</i> we know."
00:00:42.208,00:00:44.777,"On this episode of<i> Mind Field, </i> I'm going to take a look at"
00:00:44.810,00:00:47.713,"a kind of lie we tell ourselves."
00:00:47.746,00:00:52.552,"And I'm going to use belief to turn a lie...into a truth."
00:00:55.588,00:00:57.557,"<i> ( theme music playing )</i>"
00:01:09.435,00:01:12.171,"Michael: <i> If I'm going to harness   the power of belief,</i>"
00:01:12.204,00:01:15.541,"<i> I need to find a good way  to study belief and behavior.</i>"
00:01:15.574,00:01:19.278,"<i> So I'm paying a visit to UCLA's  Dr. Aaron Blaisdell,</i>"
00:01:19.311,00:01:21.247,"<i> who I worked with  on last season's</i>"
00:01:21.280,00:01:23.716,"<i> ""Greater Good""  Trolley Problem episode.</i>"

00:01:25.651,00:01:27.887,"Dr. Blaisdell, great to see you again."
00:01:27.920,00:01:29.355,"Nice to see you again, Michael."
00:01:29.388,00:01:31.157,"Thank you for your help last season,"
00:01:31.190,00:01:34.660,"but I've got this new thing I want to look into."
00:01:34.693,00:01:36.295,"I started thinking a lot about belief"
00:01:36.328,00:01:37.730,"and how we form them."
00:01:37.763,00:01:42.502,"Specifically beliefs about what causes our behavior."
00:01:42.535,00:01:44.670,"I want to be able to break it down"
00:01:44.703,00:01:47.173,"and just look at how people respond to the environment around them"
00:01:47.206,00:01:48.808,"and how it changes their belief."
00:01:48.841,00:01:51.677,"Well, a Skinner Box is a great place to start."
00:01:51.710,00:01:54.180,"because what I tell my students is,"
00:01:54.213,00:01:57.183,"a Skinner Box, for a psychologist like myself,"
00:01:57.216,00:01:59.385,"is like a test tube for a chemist."
00:01:59.418,00:02:01.721,"<i> Dr. Skinner, what are you  doing with this pigeon?</i>"
00:02:01.754,00:02:05.458,"<i> I'm getting ready to  demonstrate a fundamental  principle of behavior.</i>"
00:02:05.491,00:02:08.361,"Michael: <i> Invented by Harvard  psychologist B.F. Skinner,</i>"
00:02:08.394,00:02:11.164,"<i> a Skinner Box is a chamber  in which animals</i>"
00:02:11.197,00:02:14.767,"<i> can be isolated and exposed to  carefully controlled stimuli.</i>"
00:02:14.800,00:02:16.769,"<i> In one of his  landmark experiments,</i>"
00:02:16.802,00:02:19.338,"<i> Skinner released food  to pigeons in the boxes</i>"
00:02:19.371,00:02:20.940,"<i> at regular intervals.</i>"
00:02:20.973,00:02:22.842,"<i> What he found was that  the pigeons seemed to believe</i>"
00:02:22.875,00:02:24.410,"<i> that whatever  they happened to be doing</i>"
00:02:24.443,00:02:25.912,"<i> just before the food came</i>"
00:02:25.945,00:02:28.281,"<i> actually</i> caused<i> the food  to appear,</i>"
00:02:28.314,00:02:30.516,"<i> and would then repeat  that behavior over and over--</i>"
00:02:30.549,00:02:34.320,"<i> for example, hopping around  or spinning in circles.</i>"
00:02:34.353,00:02:38.291,"<i> Skinner called this  ""superstitious behavior.""</i>"
00:02:38.324,00:02:42.895,"So what do you want to do-- what's your dream test?"
00:02:42.928,00:02:46.966,"Basically a replication of Skinner's superstitious experiment,"
00:02:46.999,00:02:48.968,"but instead of with pigeons, with people."
00:02:49.001,00:02:51.904,"I would love to see: will people develop"
00:02:51.937,00:02:55.675,"their own sort of superstitious rituals or beliefs."
00:02:55.708,00:02:57.910,"Have we done this with people before?"
00:02:57.943,00:03:01.747,"I don't think such a rigorous test of this has been done."
00:03:01.780,00:03:05.318,"I think primarily, from the literature I know, it's pretty much pigeons."
00:03:09.755,00:03:12.225,"B.F. Skinner's work showed that if you"
00:03:12.258,00:03:14.627,"regularly deliver a reward to a pigeon,"
00:03:14.660,00:03:16.596,"regardless of how it actually acts,"
00:03:16.629,00:03:18.564,"the pigeon won't figure that out."
00:03:18.597,00:03:22.568,"Instead, the pigeon will develop superstitious behaviors"
00:03:22.601,00:03:24.904,"as if it thinks it is in control,"
00:03:24.937,00:03:27.306,"despite the lack of any evidence that it is."
00:03:27.339,00:03:28.874,"<i> But what about humans?</i>"
00:03:28.907,00:03:31.410,"<i> Watching people form  new superstitions</i>"
00:03:31.443,00:03:34.614,"<i> might show us how  beliefs are created,  but here's the thing:</i>"
00:03:34.647,00:03:37.416,"You can't just put a person in a Skinner Box."
00:03:37.449,00:03:39.652,"People are quite clever, and so instead,"
00:03:39.685,00:03:41.487,"along with Dr. Aaron Blaisdell,"
00:03:41.520,00:03:43.889,"I have developed a much more elaborate ruse."
00:03:43.922,00:03:46.426,"Welcome to Victory Vault."
00:03:47.526,00:03:50.563,"<i> â™ª</i>"
00:03:50.596,00:03:54.000,"Michael:<i> ""Victory Vault""  is a fake game show we made up</i>"
00:03:54.033,00:03:56.369,"<i> to draw our  unsuspecting subjects</i>"
00:03:56.402,00:03:58.971,"<i> into taking part in  a human Skinner Box.</i>"
00:03:59.004,00:04:01.741,"<i> To accomplish this,  we rented a sound stage</i>"
00:04:01.774,00:04:04.677,"<i> and constructed what appeared  to be a game show set,</i>"
00:04:04.710,00:04:06.479,"<i> but was really our study.</i>"
00:04:06.512,00:04:08.814,"<i> We outfitted the room  with a checkboard floor,</i>"
00:04:08.847,00:04:11.017,"<i> a button that serves  no purpose,</i>"
00:04:11.050,00:04:13.619,"<i> multiple cameras  and a live microphone,</i>"
00:04:13.652,00:04:17.056,"<i> all of which have absolutely no  connection to winning the game.</i>"
00:04:17.089,00:04:21.027,"<i> We also included  an ATM slot on the wall  where, instead of food,</i>"
00:04:21.060,00:04:23.629,"<i> dollar bills would be fed  into the room</i>"
00:04:23.662,00:04:25.364,"<i> at regular intervals.</i>"
00:04:25.397,00:04:27.433,"<i> Meanwhile, I would be  playing the role</i>"

00:04:34.907,00:04:36.842,"Yes, I know nothing. I'm excited."
00:04:36.875,00:04:38.644,"Excellent, excellent."
00:04:38.677,00:04:40.846,"Well, I'll you some things that you need to know."
00:04:40.879,00:04:44.450,"One, you will get to keep all of the money that you get today."
00:04:44.483,00:04:48.888,"The object of the game is to collect as much money as possible."
00:04:48.921,00:04:52.091,"- OK. ( laughs ) - Now, you will have  ten minutes,"
00:04:52.124,00:04:54.527,"and  that's all I'm going to tell you."
00:04:54.560,00:04:55.895,"- Go. OK? - OK."
00:04:59.965,00:05:04.603,"- Rebecca: OK. - Michael (over loudspeaker): <i> </i> All right, Rebecca, begin"
00:05:04.636,00:05:08.074,"in three, two, one, go!"
00:05:10.542,00:05:11.911," Blaisdell:<i> Of course,  right to the button,</i>"
00:05:11.944,00:05:13.646,"but she's not fixated on it,"
00:05:13.679,00:05:15.014,"she's definitely looking around there."
00:05:15.047,00:05:16.782,"Rebecca: I'm trying to figure out"
00:05:16.815,00:05:18.984,"if there's, like, a puzzle, or what this is about."
00:05:19.017,00:05:21.754,"Am I supposed to just get out?"
00:05:21.787,00:05:24.324,"No, not supposed to get out. OK."
00:05:26.825,00:05:29.962,"Oh! OK, there's money. Is that one clue?"
00:05:29.995,00:05:32.465,"Rebecca: <i> I've earned one dollar.  ( laughs )</i>"
00:05:32.498,00:05:34.867,"See? She's ""earned"" one dollar. Earned."
00:05:34.900,00:05:37.103,"I mean, she thinks she caused it to happen."
00:05:37.136,00:05:40.072,"Let's see. I think I might be onto something"
00:05:40.105,00:05:42.508,"-<i> with this door, maybe? </i> - Uh-huh."
00:05:42.541,00:05:45.111,"- OK. - Blaisdell: <i> </i> The second dollar bill"
00:05:45.144,00:05:48.514,"came out really shortly after she manipulated the door."
00:05:48.547,00:05:51.484,"That's what Skinner would call ""adventitious reinforcement."""
00:05:51.517,00:05:53.853,"She accidentally just happened to be doing something,"

00:05:55.854,00:05:58.624,"<i> Look, it reinforced that behavior,  look how strong it's become.</i>"
00:05:58.657,00:06:00.559,"Now she's doing a lot with the door,"
00:06:00.592,00:06:03.496,"<i> and this dancing, just like  one of Skinner's pigeons.</i>"
00:06:03.529,00:06:04.730,"- Anything? -<i> See?</i>"
00:06:04.763,00:06:06.132,"Michael: <i> For the first two minutes,</i>"
00:06:06.165,00:06:08.067,"<i> Rebecca believed  a specific combination</i>"

00:06:11.170,00:06:13.906,"<i> She had created  a superstitious ritual.</i>"
00:06:13.939,00:06:17.410,"<i> But when her old ritual  ceased to line up with  the reward being delivered,</i>"
00:06:17.443,00:06:19.879,"<i> she started exploring  new actions.</i>"
00:06:19.912,00:06:21.580,"Would you like to keep sending money?"
00:06:21.613,00:06:24.517,"Is it something with this? Hello, dollar bill."
00:06:24.550,00:06:26.819,"Michael:<i> This change  in Rebecca's behavior</i>"
00:06:26.852,00:06:29.989,"<i> indicates that  she stopped believing  that pressing the button</i>"
00:06:30.022,00:06:32.191,"<i> is associated with  money coming out.</i>"
00:06:32.224,00:06:34.193,"<i> Skinner called this  ""extinction.""</i>"

00:06:36.528,00:06:37.997,"Michael:<i> Not it seems  she believes</i>"

00:06:48.073,00:06:50.676,"I don't think I solved this mystery."

00:06:51.944,00:06:55.881,"Michael: Rebecca! You got some money, huh?"
00:06:55.914,00:06:57.483,"- I did! - Come take a seat."
00:06:57.516,00:06:59.952,"So, first of all, how'd it go?"
00:06:59.985,00:07:02.588,"Oh! Very confusing."
00:07:02.621,00:07:05.157,"I wasn't able to fully figure it out,"
00:07:05.190,00:07:08.127,"but it was something to do with the 20 white squares on the floor."
00:07:08.160,00:07:11.630,"Something to do with the red button as well, like a pattern, maybe?"
00:07:11.663,00:07:15.568,"Oh! Maybe I should have tried clicking on the button 20 times."
00:07:15.601,00:07:18.504,"- Yes! - OK, you wanna know what  makes the money come out?"
00:07:18.537,00:07:20.773,"Yes. It's probably something really crazy."
00:07:20.806,00:07:23.042,"- It's just 30 seconds passing. - Blaissdell: Yep."
00:07:23.075,00:07:25.077,"- It has nothing to do  with what you do. - Ohh!"
00:07:25.110,00:07:26.912,"You would have gotten the same amount,"
00:07:26.945,00:07:28.948,"but you could just sat on the floor and done nothing."
00:07:28.981,00:07:30.783,"- ( laughing ) - Yeah."
00:07:30.816,00:07:33.619,"This is actually a psychological experiment"
00:07:33.652,00:07:36.522,"based on some work done by B.F. Skinner,"
00:07:36.555,00:07:40.626,"and we are looking at the kinds of behaviors people invent"
00:07:40.659,00:07:42.728,"that they think controls the money."
00:07:42.761,00:07:45.598,"- But I think  this was fascinating. - Blaisdell: Yeah."
00:07:45.631,00:07:47.766,"- And you really do  get to keep the money. - Yay!"
00:07:47.799,00:07:50.135,"- Rebecca, thank you  for your help today. - Cool. Thank you, guys."
00:07:50.168,00:07:52.271,"Michael: <i> Rebecca's rituals  seemed to indicate</i>"
00:07:52.304,00:07:54.507,"<i> that she thought performing  for the camera</i>"

00:08:27.773,00:08:29.609,"It's like an escape room."

00:09:02.841,00:09:05.110,"( rapping ) â™ª If you're gon' push the button, then you're goin' with the button â™ª"
00:09:05.143,00:09:06.879,"â™ª And I'm pushin' on the button-- â™ª"
00:09:06.912,00:09:09.014,"Michael:<i> It was clear  that most of the superstitions</i>"
00:09:09.047,00:09:12.017,"<i> began with the button,  but evolved into something else</i>"
00:09:12.050,00:09:14.820,"<i> very quickly,  including this guy,</i>"
00:09:14.853,00:09:16.922,"<i> whose superstitious behavior</i>"
00:09:16.955,00:09:19.725,"<i> was doing absolutely nothing.</i>"
00:09:19.758,00:09:21.293," Blaisdell: <i> He's just standing there.</i>"
00:09:21.326,00:09:24.797," Michael:<i> Yeah.  Will he do something...?</i>"
00:09:27.699,00:09:29.635,"( chuckling )"
00:09:29.668,00:09:33.672,"Maybe taking the money is...bad?"
00:09:33.705,00:09:36.909,"I know strippers get singles for dancing."
00:09:36.942,00:09:39.612," Blaisdell:<i> Is he gonna dance?  I hope he doesn't strip for us.</i>"
00:09:39.645,00:09:41.180,"I can't dance like that."
00:09:43.281,00:09:45.184,"Maybe I can sweet talk the machine."
00:09:45.217,00:09:46.986,"It's just giving me money at this point."
00:09:47.019,00:09:48.754,"I'm not doing anything. ( laughs )"
00:09:48.787,00:09:50.656," Blaisdell:  <i> He's no fool.</i>"
00:09:50.689,00:09:53.359,"He's not really showing much superstitious behavior."
00:09:53.392,00:09:55.094,"<i> Even in Skinner's experiments,</i>"
00:09:55.127,00:09:57.896,"<i> not all the pigeons  showed superstitious behaviors.</i>"
00:09:57.929,00:10:01.266," Michael: <i> Obviously there's a game,  I called it a game show.</i>"
00:10:01.299,00:10:04.903,"<i> But the money's  just piling up  like it's contagious.</i>"
00:10:04.936,00:10:05.971,"<i> Oh, look!</i>"
00:10:06.004,00:10:07.406,"<i> Uh-- Oh.</i>"
00:10:07.439,00:10:08.975,"<i> He really doesn't  want to push it.</i>"
00:10:12.144,00:10:15.848,"Come on. Press it four times, out comes the money."
00:10:15.881,00:10:18.651,"- Press it four times? - Out comes the money."
00:10:18.684,00:10:19.819,"<i> ( contestant laughing )</i>"

00:10:25.390,00:10:29.662,"She believes that pressing the button is necessary, is a cause."
00:10:29.695,00:10:33.866,"<i> And the ritual consists  of a few actions  strung together.</i>"
00:10:33.899,00:10:37.369,"<i> Five, four, three...</i>"
00:10:37.402,00:10:41.040,"<i> two...one, stop.</i>"
00:10:41.073,00:10:42.675,"Can I push the button?"

00:10:44.176,00:10:46.178,"Stay where you are. We will see you very soon."
00:10:46.211,00:10:49.014,"I feel like I was supposed to push the button."

00:10:57.756,00:11:01.326,"<i> Some think they need  to perform for the camera,  or make the producers laugh.</i>"
00:11:01.359,00:11:04.397,"<i> This guy thought  that the secret was  to just be different.</i>"
00:11:06.131,00:11:08.333,"Hold it! Oh, I thought--"
00:11:08.366,00:11:10.335,"Take a seat."
00:11:10.368,00:11:12.371,"- What was that? - Michael : Great work."
00:11:12.404,00:11:14.273,"What made the money come out?"
00:11:14.306,00:11:15.974,"This is what I finally thought."
00:11:16.007,00:11:18.243,"It was a test not to push the button,"
00:11:18.276,00:11:20.412,"and then as I kept saying a cer-- a word--"
00:11:20.445,00:11:22.948,"like phrase and ""button,"" it kept coming out."
00:11:22.981,00:11:24.783,"But I didn't know how it was supposed to be phrased."
00:11:24.816,00:11:27.486,"Hit that button. Hit it a lot."
00:11:27.519,00:11:29.488,"As if your life depended on it."
00:11:29.521,00:11:31.457,"I was thinking, ""What would people not do?"""
00:11:31.490,00:11:34.059,"- Hmm. - Probably just stand there."
00:11:34.092,00:11:37.062,"So I was like, well, let's just stand there and see what happens."
00:11:37.095,00:11:39.998,"Maybe they'll reward patience over impulsiveness."
00:11:40.031,00:11:42.334,"- You started doing exercises. - Man: Yeah."
00:11:42.367,00:11:43.902,"I don't know if it rewarded you"
00:11:43.935,00:11:47.206,"for just being-- doing crazy things."
00:11:47.239,00:11:48.807,"Did you learn anything?"
00:11:48.840,00:11:52.044,"That it was dispensing like a dollar every,"
00:11:52.077,00:11:54.880,"I don't know, like 30 seconds or something."
00:11:54.913,00:11:56.849,"You're right."
00:11:56.882,00:12:00.185,"You had no control over when the money came out."
00:12:00.218,00:12:02.187,"It's pretty interesting. I'm wondering"
00:12:02.220,00:12:05.858,"- if that's because  of who you are... - Yep."
00:12:05.891,00:12:07.426,"- Wh-Who are you? - Blaisdell: Elaborate."
00:12:07.459,00:12:09.394,"That's just like my thought process, I think,"
00:12:09.427,00:12:11.029,"like I'm just very observant."
00:12:11.062,00:12:12.297,"You came up with this great"
00:12:12.330,00:12:14.466,"entering-and-exiting-the-room thing."
00:12:14.499,00:12:16.368,"Tell me about that."
00:12:16.401,00:12:18.003,"Because the money didn't start coming out"
00:12:18.036,00:12:19.938,"until after I-- I waited, I waited, I waited,"
00:12:19.971,00:12:23.008,"and nothing came out until after I left and came back in."
00:12:23.041,00:12:25.811,"You shoulda just left me in there to get more money!"
00:12:25.844,00:12:28.814,"You made a sistah work<i> hard</i> for her money."
00:12:28.847,00:12:30.783,"Michael:  <i> Victory Vault,</i>"
00:12:30.816,00:12:33.786,"a.k.a. human Skinner Box experiment."
00:12:33.819,00:12:35.788,"What are your thoughts?"
00:12:35.821,00:12:38.323,"We're really finding that humans are susceptible"
00:12:38.356,00:12:41.160,"to superstitious beliefs or behaviors."
00:12:41.193,00:12:42.995,"You know what? I totally agree."
00:12:43.028,00:12:46.565,"Except there were some people who were able to guess"
00:12:46.598,00:12:50.803,"with some degree of confidence that they<i> didn't</i> have control."
00:12:50.836,00:12:54.473,"Some people were probably just skeptical from the get-go."
00:12:54.506,00:12:56.441,"- Yeah. - And that's just their personality."
00:12:56.474,00:12:59.011,"Yeah, the beliefs that people brought into that room"
00:12:59.044,00:13:02.281,"really affected what beliefs or lack thereof..."
00:13:02.314,00:13:06.218,"- ...they created<i> in</i> the room once the game started. -<i> Yeah</i> ."
00:13:06.251,00:13:09.521,"We're belief machines. We're pattern seekers."
00:13:09.554,00:13:15.194,"And there's even a belief that in psychology and in anthropology"
00:13:15.227,00:13:19.331,"that may be the way a lot of rituals got started, by accidental reinforcement."
00:13:19.364,00:13:23.535,"And then it becomes codified into a religion or a cultural practice."
00:13:23.568,00:13:24.870,"Hmm."
00:13:24.903,00:13:28.107,"<i> â™ª</i>"
00:13:31.409,00:13:33.979,"Our human-sized Skinner Box"
00:13:34.012,00:13:36.882,"showed that when confronted with uncertainty,"
00:13:36.915,00:13:39.618,"people often behaved superstitiously,"
00:13:39.651,00:13:43.155,"under the belief that they<i> do</i> have control."
00:13:43.188,00:13:46.291,"But of course, nothing anyone did in that box"
00:13:46.324,00:13:48.961,"would make the money come out any faster."
00:13:48.994,00:13:52.931,"So those superstitions were lies."
00:13:52.964,00:13:56.535,"But sometimes if a lie is believed in enough,"
00:13:56.568,00:13:59.471,"it can literally become true,"
00:13:59.504,00:14:01.607,"like a placebo."
00:14:01.640,00:14:04.076,"Now, I've been watching  a lot of horror movies lately,"
00:14:04.109,00:14:06.378,"and they gave me an idea."
00:14:06.411,00:14:10.015,"If I'm able to find just the right preexisting beliefs"
00:14:10.048,00:14:12.117,"to wrap around a placebo,"
00:14:12.150,00:14:14.386,"could I literally make people believe"
00:14:14.419,00:14:17.956,"that I am possessing them with a spirit?"
00:14:17.989,00:14:22.661,"I want to perform a sham reverse exorcism."
00:14:22.694,00:14:28.533,"<i> Exorcisms are not some  Hollywood fabrication...</i>"
00:14:28.566,00:14:31.103,"<i> and they didn't only happen  hundreds of years ago.</i>"
00:14:31.136,00:14:33.372,"<i> In fact,  in the United States alone,</i>"
00:14:33.405,00:14:35.974,"<i> there are currently  50 priests</i>"
00:14:36.007,00:14:39.578,"<i> endorsed by the Vatican's  International Association  of Exorcists,</i>"
00:14:39.611,00:14:42.547,"<i> up from just 12 a decade ago.</i>"
00:14:42.580,00:14:44.416,"<i> But what's a reverse exorcism?</i>"
00:14:44.449,00:14:46.285,"<i> It's something I made up</i>"
00:14:46.318,00:14:49.054,"<i> where instead of removing  a spirit from someone,</i>"
00:14:49.087,00:14:51.223,"<i> you put one</i> in them."
00:14:51.256,00:14:53.458,"<i> I want to do that because  I don't think it's ethical</i>"
00:14:53.491,00:14:56.628,"<i> to tell someone  they're possessed by a demon.</i>"
00:14:56.661,00:14:58.463,"But I'll need some help,"
00:14:58.496,00:15:01.533,"and I know just who to ask."
00:15:03.335,00:15:06.338,"Michael: <i> Dr. VeissiÃ©re, thank you.</i>"
00:15:06.371,00:15:08.307,"I had a blast last season."
00:15:08.340,00:15:11.610,"I think that the work we did and the things you showed me"
00:15:11.643,00:15:15.948,"related to our power-of-suggestion work together on placebos"
00:15:15.981,00:15:17.716,"was so powerful."
00:15:17.749,00:15:19.484,"Well, Michael, it's a real pleasure."
00:15:19.517,00:15:21.253,"I'm honored to be here again."
00:15:21.286,00:15:23.021,"It also is why you're the person I thought of"
00:15:23.054,00:15:24.489,"for what I want to do next."
00:15:24.522,00:15:27.292,"Building on the work we did last season,"
00:15:27.325,00:15:30.729,"I want to explore belief"
00:15:30.762,00:15:33.165,"and what I can and cannot control."
00:15:33.198,00:15:38.637,"I want to perform an accessory- assisted reverse exorcism."
00:15:38.670,00:15:40.706,"- Hmm. - Reverse exorcism"
00:15:40.739,00:15:43.642,"because I'm not gonna tell you that you have a demon in you"
00:15:43.675,00:15:46.511,"or something in you that I'm gonna remove-- you're fine."
00:15:46.544,00:15:51.083,"What I<i> can</i> do is make you feel like you're losing control."
00:15:51.116,00:15:53.418,"You would like to experimentally induce"
00:15:53.451,00:15:55.354,"a spirit possession experience."
00:15:55.387,00:15:57.222,"- Right. - I like that."
00:15:57.255,00:16:00.359,"All right, let's talk details here."
00:16:00.392,00:16:04.429,"Are there things we can do to increase the effectiveness"
00:16:04.462,00:16:08.000,"of our reverse exorcism ritual?"
00:16:08.033,00:16:12.437,"Yeah. I'm thinking we could probably use some tricks from hypnosis."
00:16:12.470,00:16:14.473,"If we went them to have experiences,"
00:16:14.506,00:16:17.576,"we need to suggest those experiences to them specifically."
00:16:17.609,00:16:21.380,"We would be using a lot of props from both religion and science"
00:16:21.413,00:16:23.582,"to get people's critical minds to relax,"
00:16:23.615,00:16:26.118,"and then we will throw in some suggestions."
00:16:26.151,00:16:29.488,"So we've got religious iconography,"
00:16:29.521,00:16:33.525,"and we've got the paraphernalia of medical science."
00:16:33.558,00:16:35.327,"Let's do this."
00:16:35.360,00:16:37.529,"Michael:<i> Almost everyone feels  a certain way</i>"

00:18:17.896,00:18:21.733,"<i> if a guy in a white lab coat  is taking it so seriously?</i>"
00:18:21.766,00:18:23.768,"So we are just about ready to begin."
00:18:23.801,00:18:26.271,"<i> Now, I'm watching hidden  cameras that we have</i>"
00:18:26.304,00:18:28.406,"<i> in the exam room  adjacent to us.</i>"
00:18:28.439,00:18:33.612,"Let's see what sorts of altered states of consciousness we can create today."
00:18:33.645,00:18:37.415,"<i> Now, this is Jeremiah,  and Jeremiah's been waiting  for about an hour.</i>"
00:18:37.448,00:18:39.784,"Actor/Nurse: <i> So I'm gonna be  placing this on your head.</i>"
00:18:39.817,00:18:43.188,"It's called an EEG cap, it just measures"
00:18:43.221,00:18:46.291,"<i> your brain activity.</i>"
00:18:46.324,00:18:48.260,"This is a really important part of selling"
00:18:48.293,00:18:51.563,"the scientific realness of what we're doing."
00:18:51.596,00:18:53.899,"Jeremiah, very pleased to meet you."
00:18:53.932,00:18:55.534,"Thank you so much for coming."
00:18:55.567,00:18:57.402,"<i> Thank you so much again  for your patience.</i>"
00:18:57.435,00:18:59.604,"I think it's really important for VeissiÃ©re to talk about"
00:18:59.637,00:19:01.606,"how what's about to happen is special,"
00:19:01.639,00:19:03.608,"it's not a normal ritual."
00:19:03.641,00:19:06.511,"In fact, it's not a ritual that any lay people really know about yet."
00:19:06.544,00:19:08.680,"So the name of the study, it's a bit of a mouthful,"
00:19:08.713,00:19:11.716,"so we're looking at neural correlates and physiologic markers"
00:19:11.749,00:19:14.719,"of ritually induced mystical experiences."
00:19:14.752,00:19:16.821,"<i> I have run this experiment  about 30 times,</i>"
00:19:16.854,00:19:18.456,"and some people enter"
00:19:18.489,00:19:20.559,"<i> some kind of encounter with</i>"
00:19:20.592,00:19:23.195,"<i> what they may call  a divine presence.</i>"
00:19:23.228,00:19:25.497,"- Jeremiah: How's it goin'? - Michael:<i> Here comes  </i> the priest."
00:19:25.530,00:19:27.599,"- I'm Jeremiah. Nice to meet you, sir.  - Father Callahan."
00:19:27.632,00:19:30.669,"""Father Callahan,"" the Stephen King character."
00:19:30.702,00:19:32.904,"OK, we might have to change that."
00:19:32.937,00:19:35.707,"Actor/Priest:<i> Jeremiah,  what I'd like you to do...</i>"
00:19:35.740,00:19:40.445,"is relax, and I'd like you just to casually stare"
00:19:40.478,00:19:42.914,"at the crucifix, in the center."
00:19:42.947,00:19:45.217,"Michael:<i> We had our ""priest""  guide Jeremiah</i>"
00:19:45.250,00:19:46.751,"<i> through a holy ritual</i>"
00:19:46.784,00:19:49.321,"<i> which we told him  was a thousand years old.</i>"
00:19:49.354,00:19:52.424,"<i> But in actuality,  Dr. VeissiÃ©re wrote it himself</i>"
00:19:52.457,00:19:55.594,"<i> just before the demonstration.</i>"
00:19:55.627,00:19:57.329," Actor/Priest: <i> And you may feel a tendency</i>"
00:19:57.362,00:20:00.365,"<i> that you want to  let your hands raise</i>"
00:20:00.398,00:20:02.634,"towards the sky as your body falls away."
00:20:02.667,00:20:05.870,"Michael:<i> Getting someone  to literally act possessed</i>"
00:20:05.903,00:20:09.474,"<i> is definitely a difficult test  of the placebo effect,</i>"
00:20:09.507,00:20:12.410,"<i> so I'm not exactly sure  what kind of results  we can expect.</i>"
00:20:12.443,00:20:14.679,"<i> However, I'm at least hoping  that we learn from this</i>"
00:20:14.712,00:20:17.249,"<i> how to better tap into  the power of people's beliefs.</i>"
00:20:17.282,00:20:18.883," Actor/Priest:<i> Whatever  the spirit needs to speak,</i>"
00:20:18.916,00:20:20.485,"it will speak."
00:20:24.555,00:20:27.659,"So now, as you keep relaxing, as the spirit prepares..."
00:20:27.692,00:20:30.929,"<i> Jeremiah sat very still  during the whole ritual,</i>"
00:20:30.962,00:20:33.465,"<i> but we were curious  about what he experienced.</i>"
00:20:33.498,00:20:34.733,"So what did that feel like?"
00:20:34.766,00:20:36.334,"Jeremiah:  <i> It was weird,</i>"
00:20:36.367,00:20:38.036,"<i> but I could feel like  the presence,</i>"
00:20:38.069,00:20:39.804,"it's a little graphic,"
00:20:39.837,00:20:42.474,"if some, like, cut my head off."
00:20:42.507,00:20:45.577,"-<i> I didn't feel anything below. </i> -<i> Right.</i>"
00:20:45.610,00:20:47.579,"Michael:<i> People don't normally  have feelings</i>"
00:20:47.612,00:20:49.614,"<i> of decapitation and numbness,</i>"
00:20:49.647,00:20:52.417,"<i> so either we've stumbled upon  a way to summon a spirit,</i>"
00:20:52.450,00:20:55.987,"<i> or our belief manipulation  is working.</i>"
00:20:56.020,00:20:57.789,"So we've been working together on this project,"
00:20:57.822,00:21:00.292,"and I was observing you from the other room."
00:21:00.325,00:21:03.595,"And there are two really powerful kinds of symbols in the room."
00:21:03.628,00:21:06.364,"Which one had the biggest kind of visceral effect on you?"
00:21:06.397,00:21:08.867,"I guess it was kind of a balance, because, like,"
00:21:08.900,00:21:11.936,"OK, it's religious, and the nurse comin' in,"
00:21:11.969,00:21:15.640,"science-- it kinda goes back and forth, so I want to say ""even."""
00:21:15.673,00:21:20.011,"Well, more has been going on than what you know at this moment."
00:21:20.044,00:21:23.081,"Joe--Father Callahan-- was not a priest."
00:21:23.114,00:21:24.949,"- Mm-hmm. - He's an actor,"
00:21:24.982,00:21:27.519,"and everything that he read was written by Dr. VeissiÃ©re."
00:21:27.552,00:21:32.457,"We're looking at how a thing that has no known causal link"
00:21:32.490,00:21:35.427,"to any particular reaction or behavior or feeling"
00:21:35.460,00:21:37.796,"can nonetheless induce a feeling."
00:21:37.829,00:21:41.066,"Michael: <i> Jeremiah's experience  was pretty curious,</i>"
00:21:41.099,00:21:45.003,"<i> and since  nothing too serious happened--  his head didn't spin around--</i>"
00:21:45.036,00:21:50.075,"<i> we felt more comfortable  pushing things a bit further.</i>"
00:21:50.108,00:21:52.711,"I'm the lead behavioral scientist in charge of the experiment,"
00:21:52.744,00:21:54.746,"this is my colleague Dr. Stevens."
00:21:54.779,00:21:57.115,"Michael:<i> First, I interacted  with the participants</i>"
00:21:57.148,00:21:59.918,"<i> before the ritual,  to build up their expectation</i>"
00:21:59.951,00:22:03.555,"<i> of something happening--  like...possession.</i>"
00:22:03.588,00:22:08.660,"So today, you will be listening to a reverse exorcism."
00:22:08.693,00:22:13.131,"- OK. - I'm already possessed.  I'm already possessed."
00:22:13.164,00:22:15.533,"Michael:<i> We also decided  to dim the lights</i>"
00:22:15.566,00:22:18.870,"<i> to decrease their inhibitions  and increase the atmosphere.</i>"
00:22:18.903,00:22:21.573," Michael:<i> I think it's gonna be  great for our participants  and for the whole mood.</i>"
00:22:21.606,00:22:23.708,"I mean, it's spooky stuff."
00:22:23.741,00:22:26.010,"Before you can fully experience the divine,"
00:22:26.043,00:22:29.013,"I'll simply just invite you to kind of relax..."
00:22:29.046,00:22:30.849,"Michael:<i> And we decided  to have Dr. VeissiÃ©re</i>"
00:22:30.882,00:22:32.717,"<i> lead the ritual  instead of our ""priest,""</i>"
00:22:32.750,00:22:34.119,"<i> so that he could use</i>"
00:22:34.152,00:22:36.020,"<i> his training  in behavioral psychology</i>"
00:22:36.053,00:22:37.989,"<i> to harness  the power of suggestion.</i>"
00:22:38.022,00:22:39.657,"<i> The priest continued to serve</i>"
00:22:39.690,00:22:41.559,"<i> as an important religious  anchor point</i>"
00:22:41.592,00:22:42.961,"<i> for the subject to focus on.</i>"
00:22:42.994,00:22:45.463,"VeissiÃ©re: All of your actions and reactions"
00:22:45.496,00:22:47.465,"gradually fade and disappear"
00:22:47.498,00:22:50.369,"as your body is now approaching the divine."
00:22:51.569,00:22:53.138,"You may notice..."
00:22:53.171,00:22:56.107,"your fingers tingling a little."
00:22:56.140,00:22:59.544,"You may feel your mouth... needing to tweak a little."
00:23:03.681,00:23:07.452,"Her mouth is opening... slowly."
00:23:07.485,00:23:11.589,"As the divine  tries to speak through you,"
00:23:11.622,00:23:13.825,"<i> filling your mouth, perhaps,</i>"
00:23:13.858,00:23:16.395,"gently, ever so slowly."
00:23:17.795,00:23:20.698,"You are now awake."
00:23:20.731,00:23:22.600,"Good."
00:23:22.633,00:23:24.869,"Michael: <i> When the ritual ended,</i>"
00:23:24.902,00:23:27.806,"<i> each of our participants  had something very interesting  to report.</i>"
00:23:27.839,00:23:29.641,"He did definitely have an aura around him--"
00:23:29.674,00:23:31.009,"the Father."
00:23:31.042,00:23:33.011,"Woman: <i> I could feel just</i>"
00:23:33.044,00:23:36.915,"this everlasting joy and peace of God just covering me."
00:23:36.948,00:23:40.185,"There was like a glowing figure, man,"
00:23:40.218,00:23:43.588,"and then the cross was like right in front of me."
00:23:43.621,00:23:45.223,"We've got medical science"
00:23:45.256,00:23:49.127,"and we've got ancient religious symbols."
00:23:49.160,00:23:51.729,"And what we're specifically looking at"
00:23:51.762,00:23:56.034,"is how the accessories play into your expectations."
00:23:56.067,00:23:58.803,"I liked the visual part. I didn't like the audio part."
00:23:58.836,00:24:00.605,"- Interesting. - I wasn't connecting with it."
00:24:00.638,00:24:03.842,"Woman 2: I've always thought that the kind of traditional,"
00:24:03.875,00:24:06.611,"ritualistic parts of church, they just never appealed to me."
00:24:06.644,00:24:09.047,"I think it was more the symbols that was more comforting,"
00:24:09.080,00:24:11.115,"because that's just the way I was raised."
00:24:11.148,00:24:15.553,"Michael: <i> One of the most intriguing  was our final subject, Miriam.</i>"
00:24:15.586,00:24:17.121,"What was it like for you?"
00:24:17.154,00:24:19.257,"Um, I went to another place."
00:24:19.290,00:24:20.959,"OK, OK."
00:24:20.992,00:24:24.762,"I immediately felt my mother's-- her spirit with me,"
00:24:24.795,00:24:26.231,"<i> she was telling me...</i>"
00:24:26.264,00:24:28.099,"- ...to come towards her. - OK."
00:24:28.132,00:24:30.802,"And when I got close to her, she was comforting me."
00:24:30.835,00:24:34.239,"- OK. - Um, and I heard an angel say,"
00:24:34.272,00:24:36.674,"""I'm here with you. I will never leave you."""
00:24:36.707,00:24:40.678,"<i> And I continued to see wings.</i>"
00:24:40.711,00:24:42.814,"- Wings. Interesting. - Yes."
00:24:42.847,00:24:45.650,"Michael:<i> Miriam's experience  seemed to have</i>"
00:24:45.683,00:24:47.652,"<i> a profound effect on her,</i>"
00:24:47.685,00:24:51.055,"<i> but I wanted to hear more about  what exactly happened to her.</i>"
00:24:51.088,00:24:52.757,"When you say that you saw things,"
00:24:52.790,00:24:55.126,"describe for me what that was."
00:24:55.159,00:24:59.964,"Was it like a daydream, or was it more like, um, really there?"
00:24:59.997,00:25:01.833,"It was extremely vivid."
00:25:01.866,00:25:05.603,"Um, I could feel the wind when it started going across,"
00:25:05.636,00:25:08.706,"I could vividly see my mother standing there, smiling at me."
00:25:08.739,00:25:10.975,"- She looked beautiful. - Wow."
00:25:11.008,00:25:14.612,"Michael:<i> The fact that Miriam  had an out-of-body experience</i>"
00:25:14.645,00:25:17.782,"<i> and saw her deceased mother,  was almost puzzling,</i>"
00:25:17.815,00:25:20.985,"<i> because everything we did  in the room was a lie.</i>"
00:25:21.018,00:25:23.254,"<i> The priest was not real,</i>"
00:25:23.287,00:25:25.623,"<i> the ritual was not  a thousand years old,</i>"
00:25:25.656,00:25:28.760,"<i> the nurse was an actress,  but yet Miriam's experience</i>"
00:25:28.793,00:25:32.030,"<i> and those of the other  participants</i> were<i> real.</i>"
00:25:32.063,00:25:36.000,"The thing that surprised me the most today"
00:25:36.033,00:25:41.339,"was how personal every single moment was."
00:25:41.372,00:25:45.076,"I think because of a combination of the powerful imagery,"
00:25:45.109,00:25:47.312,"both religious and scientific,"
00:25:47.345,00:25:49.981,"it becomes the most powerful experience they've had."
00:25:50.014,00:25:52.750,"Even if you're a very staunch atheist,"
00:25:52.783,00:25:54.752,"a cross and a lectionary,"
00:25:54.785,00:25:56.254,"these things, they're pregnant with meaning."
00:25:56.287,00:25:59.257,"We seem to have found that by using those cues,"
00:25:59.290,00:26:01.993,"people were able to tune in very, very deeply,"
00:26:02.026,00:26:04.696,"and to relinquish their sense of self-control."
00:26:04.729,00:26:06.230,"Here's a question."
00:26:06.263,00:26:10.134,"What's the difference between what we did today"
00:26:10.167,00:26:15.039,"and what an actual priest can do?"
00:26:15.072,00:26:18.076,"That's a really controversial question."
00:26:18.109,00:26:21.379,"Um, I think the difference is that, unlike the priest,"
00:26:21.412,00:26:27.151,"we understand the mechanisms through a more psychological route,"
00:26:27.184,00:26:30.188,"whereas many priests may themselves be convinced"
00:26:30.221,00:26:32.890,"that they are facilitating communication with the divine."
00:26:32.923,00:26:34.926,"And perhaps they are."
00:26:34.959,00:26:37.295,"The results can be the same,"
00:26:37.328,00:26:40.865,"regardless of the intentions of the facilitators."
00:26:40.898,00:26:44.002,"There's no way to prove whether or not"
00:26:44.035,00:26:47.372,"God worked in this room today."
00:26:47.405,00:26:50.842,"I guess ultimately, with the tools of science, no, there isn't."
00:26:50.875,00:26:54.045,"These are still some really difficult philosophical questions."
00:26:58.916,00:27:01.419,"Michael: <i> So, we have demonstrated that</i>"
00:27:01.452,00:27:04.355,"our brains are belief-making machines."
00:27:04.388,00:27:08.092,"Rather than accepting confusion and uncertainty,"
00:27:08.125,00:27:10.795,"we create superstitions and beliefs"
00:27:10.828,00:27:14.699,"that make us feel like we have control over our lives."
00:27:14.732,00:27:17.935,"In fact, to<i> not</i> form a superstition"
00:27:17.968,00:27:20.905,"or belief or guess about the world around us"
00:27:20.938,00:27:22.674,"is to be powerless,"
00:27:22.707,00:27:26.911,"even when superstitions are unconnected to reality."
00:27:26.944,00:27:29.714,"That doesn't mean they can't be powerful."
00:27:29.747,00:27:32.350,"Our ""reverse exorcism"" ritual"
00:27:32.383,00:27:35.720,"and its practitioners were all placebos."
00:27:35.753,00:27:39.257,"But the mere existence of our subjects' beliefs in them"
00:27:39.290,00:27:42.760,"made them real and transformative."
00:27:42.793,00:27:46.297,"So does that make us all fools?"
00:27:46.330,00:27:49.767,"I don't know-- but I don't believe so."
