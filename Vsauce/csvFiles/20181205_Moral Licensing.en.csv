00:00:09.742,00:00:13.780,"Moral psychology isn't always an easy thing to study."
00:00:13.813,00:00:16.282,"First of all, just using a survey"
00:00:16.315,00:00:18.751,"to ask people what they think is moral"
00:00:18.784,00:00:22.722,"doesn't always reveal what they would do in real life."
00:00:22.755,00:00:25.324,"An experiment that actually puts people"
00:00:25.357,00:00:27.326,"in what feels like a real scenario"
00:00:27.359,00:00:29.429,"may get more realistic results,"
00:00:29.462,00:00:31.764,"but researchers must always balance the benefits"
00:00:31.797,00:00:32.965,"of what we could learn"
00:00:32.998,00:00:38.371,"with the safety and well-being of the people they study."
00:00:38.404,00:00:41.774,"Secondly, what we learn from moral psychology experiments"
00:00:41.807,00:00:44.477,"doesn't always make humans look good."
00:00:44.510,00:00:48.514,"For example, today we're going to look at moral licensing:"
00:00:48.547,00:00:51.418,"the theory that when you do something good..."
00:00:52.885,00:00:56.389,"you subconsciously feel you've earned a license"
00:00:56.422,00:00:58.758,"to then do something bad."
00:01:21.313,00:01:23.483,"<i> I've been working  with Dr. Kyle Stanford,</i>"
00:01:23.516,00:01:25.518,"<i> from the Department of Logic  and Philosophy of Science</i>"
00:01:25.551,00:01:27.386,"<i> at the University  of California, Irvine,</i>"
00:01:27.419,00:01:31.290,"<i> on a way to observe  moral licensing in the wild.</i>"
00:01:31.323,00:01:34.527,"So I want to see moral licensing in effect."
00:01:34.560,00:01:37.597,"I want to see people who have been led to believe,"
00:01:37.630,00:01:40.733,"through their own actions, that they're good."
00:01:40.766,00:01:43.436,"Use that feeling"
00:01:43.469,00:01:44.804,"to do bad."
00:01:44.837,00:01:46.672,"The thing to keep in mind,"
00:01:46.705,00:01:48.341,"it's like people are keeping tabs,"
00:01:48.374,00:01:50.209,"and they give themselves credit for the moral..."
00:01:50.242,00:01:51.777,"the good thing they did."
00:01:51.810,00:01:54.280,"But none of that is happening consciously, right?"
00:01:54.313,00:01:56.482,"So we shouldn't imagine that a person who's engaged"
00:01:56.515,00:01:59.585,"in moral licensing is asking themselves in their head..."
00:01:59.618,00:02:00.686,"Right, pulling out their scorecard."
00:02:00.719,00:02:02.755,"...what should I be? Does it make me a good person?"
00:02:02.788,00:02:04.390,"But it is going on, and they don't experience it."
00:02:04.423,00:02:06.559,"-They don't know that it's happening.  -Right."
00:02:06.592,00:02:08.661,"I think we're going to learn a lot today."
00:02:08.694,00:02:10.663,"-I say we go get started.  -Let's do it."
00:02:10.696,00:02:11.798,"Let's do it."
00:02:16.835,00:02:18.638,"[Michael]<i> So here's how  the moral licensing test</i>"
00:02:18.671,00:02:20.506,"<i> we designed is going to work.</i>"
00:02:20.539,00:02:22.808,"<i> First, we're going to take  this beautiful park</i>"
00:02:22.841,00:02:24.911,"<i> and, for the purposes  of science,</i>"
00:02:24.944,00:02:26.779,"<i> throw trash everywhere.</i>"
00:02:26.812,00:02:29.782,"<i> Next, we've hired  some unsuspecting actors</i>"
00:02:29.815,00:02:32.318,"<i> who think they're going to film  a public service announcement</i>"
00:02:32.351,00:02:33.553,"<i> about the park.</i>"
00:02:33.586,00:02:34.720,"-Hey, Jake. Hey, man. -Hi."
00:02:34.753,00:02:36.622,"-Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you."
00:02:36.655,00:02:37.856,"<i> Once they've arrived,</i>"
00:02:37.890,00:02:41.360,"<i> it will be obvious  that the trash is a problem.</i>"
00:02:41.393,00:02:44.463,"We just need to clean up this little alleyway right here."
00:02:44.496,00:02:47.700,"<i> Will they do a good deed  and earn some moral credit</i>"
00:02:47.733,00:02:50.536,"<i> by volunteering to help  pick up the trash, or not?</i>"
00:02:50.569,00:02:52.805,"<i> And to make everything  feel more real,</i>"
00:02:52.838,00:02:55.575,"<i> we did have them film  our fake PSA.</i>"
00:02:55.608,00:02:57.510,"Forget the concrete and the heat."
00:02:57.543,00:03:00.780,"Relax in over 16,000 square feet."
00:03:00.813,00:03:02.949,"Of outdoor space that can't be beat."
00:03:02.982,00:03:04.684,"Right outside your door."
00:03:04.717,00:03:06.219,"Right outside your door."
00:03:06.252,00:03:07.987,"Right outside your door."
00:03:08.020,00:03:09.355,"<i> After shooting the PSA,</i>"
00:03:09.388,00:03:12.458,"<i> each participant will be asked  to wait in a separate area</i>"
00:03:12.491,00:03:13.893,"<i> for some final paperwork.</i>"
00:03:13.926,00:03:16.963,"<i> There, our confederate Cameron,  who appears to be homeless,</i>"
00:03:16.996,00:03:18.197,"<i> will ask them for money.</i>"
00:03:18.231,00:03:20.833,"<i> Meanwhile, Dr. Stanford and I  will be watching</i>"
00:03:20.866,00:03:24.237,"<i> behind the scenes to observe  how our subjects react.</i>"
00:03:24.270,00:03:25.771,"<i> So, will our participants</i>"
00:03:25.804,00:03:28.374,"<i> keep their subconscious  moral scorecards balanced</i>"
00:03:28.407,00:03:31.444,"<i> by giving money  when they didn't clean,</i>"
00:03:31.477,00:03:35.315,"<i> or feeling like they don't need  to give money if they did?</i>"
00:03:42.655,00:03:43.856,"-Hey! -Makaylo."
00:03:43.889,00:03:45.424,"Makaylo, nice to meet you."
00:03:45.457,00:03:47.560,"<i> First up in our demo  was Makaylo.</i>"
00:03:47.593,00:03:49.862,"<i> We used our actual  Mind Field crew</i>"
00:03:49.895,00:03:51.597,"<i> as the crew of the fake PSA</i>"
00:03:51.630,00:03:53.499,"<i> who are overwhelmed  with the task</i>"
00:03:53.532,00:03:54.934,"<i> of cleaning up  all the trash.</i>"
00:03:54.967,00:03:58.604,"We normally sort of never ask this, but..."
00:03:58.637,00:04:00.840,"we've got, like, all this stuff that we're trying to clean up."
00:04:00.873,00:04:02.675,"I'm going to grab some gloves. I was wondering,"
00:04:02.708,00:04:03.709,"would you help me?"
00:04:03.743,00:04:05.444,"-I'm sorry... -Let's do it. Let's do it."
00:04:05.477,00:04:06.678,"All three of us can triple-team it."
00:04:06.712,00:04:07.947,"-and we can get this thing going. -Let's do it. Let's do it."
00:04:09.715,00:04:11.984,"Yeah, this is just what we wanted to do today."
00:04:12.017,00:04:14.353,"It looks like someone had a good time, though."
00:04:14.386,00:04:15.955,"[Michael] All right, so picking up the trash."
00:04:15.988,00:04:17.723,"How do you think that's currently sitting"
00:04:17.756,00:04:19.458,"with our actor?"
00:04:19.491,00:04:21.560,"He's thinking of himself as having done a good deed"
00:04:21.593,00:04:23.763,"that he didn't need to do, that he didn't have to do."
00:04:23.796,00:04:26.465,"Right? And so the moral credit is high."
00:04:26.498,00:04:29.435,"[Michael]<i> Then it was time  to shoot our PSA.</i>"
00:04:29.468,00:04:30.670,"[man] Take it away."
00:04:30.703,00:04:32.772,"Forget the concrete and the heat."
00:04:32.805,00:04:35.374,"Relax in 16,000 square feet."
00:04:35.407,00:04:37.076,"[man] That was great! All right, man."
00:04:37.109,00:04:39.445,"-Hey, thanks so much. -Cool. No problem, man."
00:04:39.478,00:04:42.848,"<i> We compensated our participants  for the PSA in small bills</i>"
00:04:42.881,00:04:45.017,"<i> so they would have plenty  to give the homeless man,</i>"
00:04:45.050,00:04:46.819,"<i> should they choose to do so.</i>"
00:04:46.852,00:04:48.921,"-Here's $50. -Thank you, thank you."
00:04:48.954,00:04:51.090,"<i> Then we asked them to wait  in a nearby tent</i>"
00:04:51.123,00:04:52.958,"<i> for their final paperwork.</i>"
00:04:52.991,00:04:55.594,"<i> Will Makaylo's good deed  be enough moral credit</i>"
00:04:55.627,00:04:58.030,"<i> for him to pass on  helping the homeless guy?</i>"
00:04:58.063,00:04:59.532,"All right, Cameron, this is Michael."
00:04:59.565,00:05:00.867,"You can go ahead."
00:05:13.979,00:05:15.448,"What's up?"
00:05:15.481,00:05:17.350,"-What's up? -Hi."
00:05:17.383,00:05:18.784,"Are you with this?"
00:05:18.817,00:05:21.787,"Yeah, I'm just waiting for someone to help me out here."
00:05:21.820,00:05:23.622,"Could you help me out with like a dollar or two?"
00:05:23.655,00:05:25.691,"Just, I can go to the vending machine?"
00:05:25.724,00:05:28.761,"Sorry, my man, I ain't got nothing but $20 bills on me right now."
00:05:28.794,00:05:30.730,"Oh, I got nothing but $20 bills."
00:05:30.763,00:05:32.098,"[laughs]"
00:05:32.131,00:05:33.833,"-You sure? -Yeah, man."
00:05:35.000,00:05:38.104,"All right, well..."
00:05:38.137,00:05:39.972,"[Michael] We're going to go talk to him."
00:05:43.008,00:05:43.676,"Hey, Makaylo."
00:05:43.709,00:05:44.843,"-Hey. -Thanks for waiting."
00:05:44.877,00:05:46.846,"-I'm Michael. Nice to meet you. -No problem. Makaylo."
00:05:46.879,00:05:47.847,"-This is Kyle. -Nice to meet you."
00:05:47.880,00:05:49.115,"Nice to meet you, Makaylo."
00:05:49.148,00:05:51.417,"We really appreciate your help today."
00:05:51.450,00:05:53.586,"-I just saw-- Did a guy come by? -Yes."
00:05:53.619,00:05:54.820,"What did he ask?"
00:05:54.854,00:05:56.822,"-For a dollar bill. -[Michael] Oh, for a dollar bill?"
00:05:56.855,00:05:57.890,"Yeah."
00:05:57.923,00:05:59.658,"Did you give him money?"
00:05:59.691,00:06:02.628,"-No. -What'd you tell him?"
00:06:02.661,00:06:03.929,"I just told him I didn't have anything."
00:06:03.963,00:06:08.134,"So I'm going to debrief you on what we're doing here today."
00:06:08.167,00:06:10.703,"We're doing a psychological exploratory experiment"
00:06:10.736,00:06:13.639,"on what's called moral licensing."
00:06:13.672,00:06:16.075,"We're looking at the correlation between people"
00:06:16.108,00:06:20.045,"who do volunteer to help pick up the trash,"
00:06:20.078,00:06:21.814,"and how generous you are later"
00:06:21.847,00:06:24.083,"to a homeless person who walks by."
00:06:24.116,00:06:25.518,"Interesting."
00:06:25.551,00:06:28.554,"Now, you just exhibited the exact pattern"
00:06:28.587,00:06:29.722,"of moral licensing, right?"
00:06:29.755,00:06:32.158,"In that you had already done a good deed--"
00:06:32.191,00:06:34.026,"So I was good for the day. Right."
00:06:34.059,00:06:35.094,"[Michael] <i> Did we just see</i>"
00:06:35.127,00:06:36.595,"<i> moral licensing in effect?</i>"
00:06:36.628,00:06:37.930,"<i> Perhaps.</i>"
00:06:37.963,00:06:40.199,"<i> Let's see what  our other subjects do.</i>"
00:06:40.232,00:06:42.668,"Here, let me just have you hang out here."
00:06:42.701,00:06:44.770,"Is there anybody that can help us clean up this?"
00:06:44.803,00:06:46.772,"-I'm going to go look around. -All right."
00:06:46.805,00:06:48.974,"Okay, so this is Alex."
00:06:49.007,00:06:53.145,"And Alex is just messing with his stuff."
00:06:53.178,00:06:55.047,"[Kyle] He's either not really noticing,"
00:06:55.080,00:06:56.582,"or pretending not to notice."
00:06:56.615,00:06:57.850,"But all of that is just fine."
00:06:57.883,00:06:59.885,"The question is what he then goes on to do."
00:06:59.918,00:07:02.621,"[Michael]<i> So Alex didn't help  pick up trash.</i>"
00:07:02.654,00:07:05.057,"<i> Will his guilt put him  at a moral deficit,</i>"
00:07:05.090,00:07:08.127,"<i> and therefore motivate him to  give money to the homeless man?</i>"
00:07:11.563,00:07:12.965,"Hey."
00:07:12.998,00:07:14.967,"Can you spare some money? Maybe help me out?"
00:07:15.000,00:07:16.735,"-You want a buck? -A buck? Yeah."
00:07:16.768,00:07:18.504,"Can I give you a buck? Is that cool?"
00:07:18.537,00:07:20.606,"[Cameron] That's more than cool, man."
00:07:20.639,00:07:21.807,"I just got paid to be here."
00:07:21.840,00:07:22.842,"-Really? -Yeah."
00:07:22.875,00:07:24.243,"Helping to shoot a PSA, yeah."
00:07:24.276,00:07:25.711,"Where do I sign up?"
00:07:27.012,00:07:28.881,"-Thank you. -All right, take care."
00:07:28.914,00:07:31.584,"All right. Very interesting."
00:07:31.617,00:07:33.986,"I do wonder if he felt a little bit of guilt."
00:07:34.019,00:07:35.588,"We got it in the opposite direction,"
00:07:35.621,00:07:37.122,"-which was going to be the hard thing to do. -Yeah."
00:07:37.155,00:07:38.791,"I'm very happy about this."
00:07:38.824,00:07:41.227,"[Michael] Next, we have Jake."
00:07:41.260,00:07:44.096,"So I'm on set doing a PSA shoot."
00:07:44.129,00:07:45.531,"[Michael] Hey, he's doing a vlog."
00:07:45.564,00:07:47.199,"And I get here, and it appears"
00:07:47.232,00:07:50.669,"that someone had a... what could only be described"
00:07:50.702,00:07:52.238,"as a trash party."
00:07:52.271,00:07:55.174,"I mean, they just threw trash literally everywhere,"
00:07:55.207,00:07:57.042,"all over where they want to shoot."
00:07:57.075,00:08:01.580,"So I'm going to go help them pick up some of the trash."
00:08:01.613,00:08:03.148,"First, I'm going to make sure that I document"
00:08:03.181,00:08:04.950,"that I'm a helper."
00:08:04.983,00:08:07.253,"I would also like to point out, though, that he has not helped."
00:08:07.286,00:08:09.855,"-[Kyle] Right. -He's gone back into the tent."
00:08:09.888,00:08:13.726,"And I wonder, when it comes to moral licensing,"
00:08:13.759,00:08:14.660,"does this play an effect?"
00:08:14.694,00:08:17.296,"I can check the box. Not only am I good,"
00:08:17.329,00:08:19.532,"but the world knows I'm good."
00:08:19.565,00:08:20.866,"Now, this is something we haven't seen before."
00:08:20.899,00:08:21.767,"[Michael] I love this."
00:08:21.800,00:08:25.671,"I love that he got credit for helping,"
00:08:25.704,00:08:27.072,"-but didn't. -Right."
00:08:27.105,00:08:28.674,"What's interesting but hard to know"
00:08:28.707,00:08:30.276,"is how that'll look to him,"
00:08:30.309,00:08:33.045,"whether he'll see himself as having done a good deed,"
00:08:33.078,00:08:36.215,"or seeing himself as kind of skated on the obligation,"
00:08:36.248,00:08:37.049,"because he didn't really help."
00:08:39.718,00:08:41.253,"Hey, do you think you could spare some money,"
00:08:41.286,00:08:43.122,"maybe help me out?"
00:08:43.155,00:08:44.990,"Here, man. Here's a dollar."
00:08:45.023,00:08:46.859,"-Really? -Yeah."
00:08:46.892,00:08:48.327,"Go for it."
00:08:48.360,00:08:50.863,"All right, you're a good man. Thank you."
00:08:50.896,00:08:53.299,"We were really curious as we were watching this all unfold,"
00:08:53.332,00:08:57.336,"because you agreed to help, and then you recorded a video"
00:08:57.369,00:08:59.071,"about how you were going to help,"
00:08:59.104,00:09:01.073,"but by the time all that was over,"
00:09:01.106,00:09:02.274,"you didn't need to help."
00:09:02.307,00:09:03.676,"It was all cleaned up."
00:09:03.709,00:09:05.311,"-Right. -So we were wondering,"
00:09:05.344,00:09:07.780,"did you feel like you had helped, or not?"
00:09:07.813,00:09:09.915,"No. I didn't have time to."
00:09:09.948,00:09:12.017,"And you didn't feel guilty."
00:09:12.050,00:09:14.920,"Like, ooh, I kind of like got out of helping."
00:09:14.953,00:09:16.722,"No, I didn't feel bad about that."
00:09:16.755,00:09:18.324,"I would have definitely picked up trash."
00:09:20.392,00:09:23.862,"Erin's likely to be thinking that she's doing a good deed."
00:09:23.895,00:09:24.863,"Yeah."
00:09:24.896,00:09:26.699,"Could you maybe help me out, give me some money?"
00:09:26.732,00:09:28.867,"I'm sorry, I don't have anything on me here."
00:09:28.900,00:09:29.935,"-No? -They won't let me."
00:09:29.968,00:09:32.204,"-Oh. -Yeah."
00:09:32.237,00:09:34.707,"-That was great. -Yes, we have a couple"
00:09:34.740,00:09:36.609,"good illustrations in both directions."
00:09:36.642,00:09:38.644,"[Michael]<i> We seemed to have  witnessed moral licensing</i>"
00:09:38.677,00:09:40.245,"<i> at play in several cases.</i>"
00:09:40.278,00:09:42.881,"<i> But, of course, as with  any demonstration like this,</i>"
00:09:42.914,00:09:45.684,"<i> our results weren't always  cut-and-dry.</i>"
00:09:45.717,00:09:47.219,"I'm going to go try to clean this up myself,"
00:09:47.252,00:09:48.654,"and then..."
00:09:48.687,00:09:49.888,"Gotcha. Yeah, yeah."
00:09:49.922,00:09:53.092,"<i> Some of the participants  both didn't help clean</i>"
00:09:53.125,00:09:56.095,"<i> and declined to give  our homeless man money.</i>"
00:09:56.128,00:09:57.029,"Could you maybe spare some change?"
00:09:57.063,00:09:58.998,"I just want to go to the vending machine?"
00:09:59.031,00:10:00.666,"Uh..."
00:10:00.699,00:10:03.068,"<i> However, they did find  other ways to help hiim</i>"
00:10:03.101,00:10:05.904,"<i> that could qualify  as a good deed.</i>"
00:10:05.937,00:10:07.139,"They have snacks, maybe."
00:10:07.172,00:10:09.308,"I'm going to take a pop."
00:10:09.341,00:10:10.876,"[laughs] Okay."
00:10:10.909,00:10:12.778,"Do you want a soda or something?"
00:10:12.811,00:10:14.614,"Yeah, that'd be..."
00:10:16.281,00:10:17.983,"Do you maybe have a little money as well?"
00:10:18.016,00:10:20.419,"-I don't, sorry. But... -Okay."
00:10:20.452,00:10:21.687,"...which one do you want?"
00:10:24.222,00:10:25.824,"So what was going through your mind"
00:10:25.857,00:10:27.259,"when you made the decision not to give"
00:10:27.292,00:10:29.128,"some of the cash that we know you had"
00:10:29.161,00:10:30.796,"to the man who was asking?"
00:10:30.829,00:10:33.298,"You know, there's just like a whole bunch of stereotypes"
00:10:33.331,00:10:35.768,"about homeless people."
00:10:35.801,00:10:38.771,"And you don't know what you're getting into."
00:10:38.804,00:10:40.305,"[Michael] <i> And we had a couple subjects</i>"
00:10:40.338,00:10:43.409,"<i> who both volunteered to clean  and gave money.</i>"
00:10:43.442,00:10:45.210,"Do you need any assistance?"
00:10:45.243,00:10:47.746,"If you wouldn't mind, that'd be really helpful."
00:10:47.779,00:10:49.682,"[Michael] Oh, he's offering to help. Oh!"
00:10:49.715,00:10:51.917,"-Do you need any help? -Oh, would you mind?"
00:10:51.950,00:10:54.887,"-[Kyle] Oh, she just offered. She offered. -[Michael] She's volunteered."
00:10:54.920,00:10:57.056,"<i> These were the only two  participants</i>"
00:10:57.089,00:10:59.091,"<i> who did good deeds  at both opportunities.</i>"
00:10:59.124,00:11:01.727,"-[man] Thank you so much for the help.  -[Diana] Of course."
00:11:01.760,00:11:03.262,"-Do you maybe have some spare change?  -Here you go."
00:11:03.295,00:11:05.097,"-Thanks a lot. -Best of luck."
00:11:05.130,00:11:06.331,"-Here you go. Hope it helps. -Thank you so much."
00:11:06.364,00:11:08.333,"You're welcome."
00:11:08.366,00:11:10.002,"[Michael] All right, let's go talk to her."
00:11:10.035,00:11:11.970,"Another good, good person."
00:11:12.003,00:11:14.840,"What motivated you to give the man money?"
00:11:14.873,00:11:17.476,"I actually tend to give people money often."
00:11:17.509,00:11:19.812,"I don't know if that's the best thing."
00:11:19.845,00:11:21.447,"Interesting."
00:11:21.480,00:11:25.284,"<i> So two people both cleaned  and donated money.</i>"
00:11:25.317,00:11:28.253,"<i> But everyone else either  cleaned and didn't give,</i>"
00:11:28.286,00:11:31.090,"<i> or didn't clean,  but gave in some form.</i>"
00:11:33.358,00:11:36.228,"What do you think about how everything went?"
00:11:36.261,00:11:39.965,"Well, it was really interesting. I would like to do it with many more people."
00:11:39.998,00:11:42.434,"But I think we saw the phenomenon, right?"
00:11:42.467,00:11:44.002,"We saw the thing happen."
00:11:44.035,00:11:46.305,"Something we weren't expecting, actually,"
00:11:46.338,00:11:50.409,"is sort of the gap between what people did"
00:11:50.442,00:11:52.845,"and what they said about why they did it."
00:11:52.878,00:11:54.346,"-Yeah. -Right? And that's something--"
00:11:54.379,00:11:56.215,"I mean, social psychology generally has learned"
00:11:56.248,00:11:58.951,"to be very suspicious of people's rationales"
00:11:58.984,00:12:00.986,"or justifications for their own behavior."
00:12:01.019,00:12:03.288,"But these actually fit kind of nicely."
00:12:03.321,00:12:06.325,"You could see people straining to defend themselves"
00:12:06.358,00:12:10.028,"if they didn't do a good deed that was open to them."
00:12:10.061,00:12:13.866,"Right? And then a lot of people who did good deeds had the,"
00:12:13.899,00:12:15.934,"""Well, of course, that's what anyone would do"" attitude."
00:12:15.967,00:12:17.069,"-Right? -[Michael] Yeah."
00:12:17.102,00:12:18.070,"<i> I believe our study</i>"
00:12:18.103,00:12:20.038,"<i> successfully created  the conditions</i>"
00:12:20.071,00:12:21.874,"<i> for moral licensing  to emerge.</i>"
00:12:21.907,00:12:22.842,"<i> It was a great first step</i>"
00:12:22.875,00:12:24.843,"<i> towards taking  this kind of study</i>"
00:12:24.876,00:12:27.212,"<i> out of the lab  and into the real world.</i>"
00:12:27.245,00:12:30.282,"<i> But, of course, many people  already have a philosophy</i>"
00:12:30.315,00:12:32.951,"<i> about giving to the homeless  that might be stronger</i>"
00:12:32.984,00:12:34.887,"<i> than the impact  of a good deed they do.</i>"
00:12:34.920,00:12:36.522,"<i> So we're not done yet.</i>"
00:12:36.555,00:12:39.057,"Now, here's what I want to do next, okay?"
00:12:39.090,00:12:40.893,"We learned a lot of lessons today,"
00:12:40.926,00:12:43.462,"and I think one of them is that when the scenarios"
00:12:43.495,00:12:44.530,"you put people in"
00:12:44.563,00:12:48.167,"are scenarios they may have experienced before,"
00:12:48.200,00:12:50.869,"that can affect the results."
00:12:50.902,00:12:54.406,"If someone did or did not give money to a homeless person,"
00:12:54.439,00:12:56.375,"they can easily explain it away as,"
00:12:56.408,00:12:58.577,"""Well, I never do,"" or ""I always do."""
00:12:58.610,00:12:59.578,"I want to find a scenario"
00:12:59.611,00:13:01.914,"that we don't find ourselves in very often,"
00:13:01.947,00:13:04.149,"that we haven't created a philosophy"
00:13:04.182,00:13:06.552,"or identity about ourselves around."
00:13:06.585,00:13:07.486,"For instance,"
00:13:07.520,00:13:09.454,"allowing someone else to take the blame"
00:13:09.487,00:13:11.223,"for something that you did."
00:13:11.256,00:13:13.192,"Because that seems like a scenario"
00:13:13.225,00:13:17.362,"where all of us would say we would never let that happen."
00:13:17.395,00:13:22.367,"But if we build up significant moral license in that person,"
00:13:22.400,00:13:24.536,"will they actually do something"
00:13:24.569,00:13:28.140,"that none of us would ever want to admit that we would do?"
00:13:28.173,00:13:31.076,"Are you down to plan something else?"
00:13:31.109,00:13:32.578,"I am down indeed."
00:13:32.611,00:13:33.946,"All right, let's do it."
00:13:37.315,00:13:39.918,"[Michael]<i> Kyle and I developed  a different sort of test</i>"
00:13:39.951,00:13:42.221,"<i> to really try and pinpoint  moral licensing</i>"
00:13:42.254,00:13:44.556,"<i> by putting our participants  in a situation</i>"
00:13:44.589,00:13:46.892,"<i> they'd likely never  been in before,</i>"
00:13:46.925,00:13:49.895,"<i> and thus had no preconceived  assumptions about.</i>"
00:13:49.928,00:13:52.965,"<i> A test that might make people  behave in a way</i>"
00:13:52.998,00:13:55.935,"<i> that could surprise  even themselves.</i>"
00:13:59.104,00:14:01.240,"Welcome, everybody. Thank you for coming today."
00:14:01.273,00:14:02.941,"In a nutshell, what we're doing"
00:14:02.974,00:14:06.011,"is we're going to see if we can get people to do something"
00:14:06.044,00:14:08.280,"that almost all of us would never admit"
00:14:08.313,00:14:10.249,"we're capable of doing:"
00:14:10.282,00:14:12.050,"to allow a child to take the blame"
00:14:12.083,00:14:13.986,"for a crime they committed."
00:14:14.019,00:14:17.589,"And we're going to do that by using moral licensing."
00:14:17.622,00:14:20.092,"Early on in the demonstration or experiment,"
00:14:20.125,00:14:22.928,"they're going to have an opportunity to donate money."
00:14:22.961,00:14:25.430,"<i> To really up the value  of their moral action,</i>"
00:14:25.463,00:14:28.233,"<i> we will tell the participants  that for every dollar they give</i>"
00:14:28.266,00:14:30.269,"<i> of the money  they've made today,</i>"
00:14:30.302,00:14:33.672,"<i> 100 times that amount will be  given to children's hospitals.</i>"
00:14:33.705,00:14:35.974,"<i> So if they donate  just a dollar today,</i>"
00:14:36.007,00:14:38.210,"<i> they'll feel like  they gave $100.</i>"
00:14:38.243,00:14:41.380,"We're giving them a chance there to do something morally good"
00:14:41.413,00:14:43.181,"that will hopefully make them feel"
00:14:43.214,00:14:45.217,"like they don't have to step up"
00:14:45.250,00:14:50.422,"and keep this innocent child from taking the fall"
00:14:50.455,00:14:52.557,"for their crimes later on."
00:14:52.590,00:14:54.559,"They just think they're coming to test out"
00:14:54.592,00:14:56.528,"really cool VR equipment"

00:17:00.218,00:17:02.788,"So our thief is trying to get in."
00:17:02.821,00:17:05.424,"The question is, will Kimberly let him in?"
00:17:05.457,00:17:08.593,"[knocking persists]"
00:17:08.626,00:17:10.095,"Is somebody knocking?"

00:17:39.691,00:17:41.860,"Okay, I'll have you..."
00:17:41.893,00:17:44.362,"do you guys know if there was anybody"
00:17:44.395,00:17:45.864,"who wasn't supposed to be in here?"
00:17:45.897,00:17:48.200,"Yeah, I let someone in."
00:17:49.801,00:17:51.303,"Okay."
00:17:52.770,00:17:54.372,"Um..."

00:18:10.788,00:18:12.891,"What happened?"
00:18:12.924,00:18:14.459,"I don't know."
00:18:14.492,00:18:16.461,"Kimberly didn't speak up."
00:18:16.494,00:18:17.796,"We'll get to see the full escalation."
00:18:33.845,00:18:37.349,"[woman] Yeah, I was gone for maybe, like, three minutes,"
00:18:37.382,00:18:40.418,"and..."
00:18:40.451,00:18:41.720,"one of the sets is gone."
00:18:41.753,00:18:43.155,"I mean..."
00:18:43.188,00:18:44.356,"[sighs]"

00:18:48.560,00:18:50.662,"You just opened the door and let someone in?"
00:18:50.695,00:18:52.564,"Yeah."
00:18:52.597,00:18:54.232,"Mm-mm."
00:18:54.265,00:18:55.534,"Oh, my gosh."
00:18:55.567,00:18:58.303,"My heart rate's going."
00:18:58.336,00:19:00.639,"I mean, I didn't know, so..."
00:19:05.243,00:19:08.313,"I think Kimberly's really nervous to say anything."
00:19:08.346,00:19:10.415,"[Kyle] She hasn't decided at this point"
00:19:10.448,00:19:11.816,"that she's going to let him take the blame."
00:19:11.849,00:19:14.319,"But she's seeing how it plays out."

00:19:15.787,00:19:17.822,"<i> and to prolong  the opportunity</i>"

00:19:19.424,00:19:21.426,"<i> we sent in security.</i>"

00:19:27.899,00:19:29.668,"Okay, we have to keep things safe,"
00:19:29.701,00:19:32.404,"because just in case there's something else going on here."
00:19:34.672,00:19:36.841,"Can you tell me what you saw?"
00:19:36.874,00:19:38.610,"Is there something that you saw,"
00:19:38.643,00:19:40.245,"or that you noticed that was...?"
00:19:40.278,00:19:42.280,"I literally just came in, like, five minutes ago,"
00:19:42.313,00:19:43.848,"and there was just dudes coming in and out."
00:19:43.881,00:19:46.284,"-So... -Okay."
00:19:46.317,00:19:49.955,"The guy that he's describing, he was coming in and out?"
00:19:49.988,00:19:52.924,"There was like a couple guys coming in and out, so..."
00:19:52.957,00:19:56.294,"-[Noah] But there were tons of guys coming in and out. -Yeah."
00:19:56.327,00:19:58.663,"All right, I'm going to have Calvin take the kid away."
00:19:58.696,00:19:59.931,"Okay, sorry, but..."
00:19:59.964,00:20:03.969,"Mom, you and the son are going to need to come with me, okay?"
00:20:06.938,00:20:08.840,"Yeah, still have them come in."

00:20:33.765,00:20:36.268,"I'm gonna debrief you on what's been happening here today."
00:20:36.301,00:20:37.569,"Okay?"
00:20:37.602,00:20:39.871,"There is no VR experience."

00:20:47.979,00:20:50.615,"Now, you gave a donation today."
00:20:50.648,00:20:51.883,"Yeah."
00:20:51.916,00:20:53.485,"How'd you feel about that?"
00:20:53.518,00:20:55.487,"I was, like, let me help out."
00:20:55.520,00:20:58.623,"When the child actor took responsibility"
00:20:58.656,00:21:00.959,"for letting a person in,"
00:21:00.992,00:21:03.061,"were you at all conflicted"

00:21:09.567,00:21:10.869,"I was just frozen."

00:21:11.703,00:21:14.406,"I feel so uncomfortable right now."
00:21:14.439,00:21:17.742,"I, like, just kind of let him say whatever he wanted."
00:21:17.775,00:21:19.844,"And I assume, like, if somebody actually took anything,"
00:21:19.877,00:21:23.648,"they'd be like, hey, you're the one that let the guy in."
00:21:23.681,00:21:25.383,"<i> In Kimberly's case,</i>"

00:21:38.463,00:21:40.031,"she's utterly typical, we all do that."
00:21:40.064,00:21:43.401,"What subjects are most likely doing is confabulating"

00:25:53.217,00:25:55.320,"But it was just... didn't quite know what was going on"
00:25:55.353,00:25:57.288,"in that scenario there."
00:25:57.321,00:25:58.990,"[Michael] <i> Michael's behavior shows us</i>"
00:25:59.023,00:26:01.326,"<i> just how complicated  moral reasoning is.</i>"
00:26:01.359,00:26:03.895,"<i> That even when we want  to do the right thing,</i>"
00:26:03.928,00:26:06.331,"<i> it doesn't take much  for us to step back</i>"
00:26:06.364,00:26:09.100,"<i> and abandon that sense  of morality if, and when,</i>"
00:26:09.133,00:26:10.635,"<i> we are given an out.</i>"
00:26:12.770,00:26:14.172,"So, Kyle."
00:26:15.640,00:26:18.676,"I was pretty surprised by how far"
00:26:18.709,00:26:22.947,"so many people were willing to let the wrong blame game go."
00:26:22.980,00:26:26.184,"Viewers may well be sitting there"
00:26:26.217,00:26:29.854,"judging the people who didn't jump up to take responsibility."
00:26:29.887,00:26:33.224,"But I think the kind of evidence we're gathering"
00:26:33.257,00:26:36.160,"shows that it's much more possible than you think"
00:26:36.193,00:26:38.997,"to get regular people to do things"
00:26:39.030,00:26:41.699,"that they immediately feel regretful about."
00:26:41.732,00:26:44.369,"Another kind of lesson I think we get here"
00:26:44.402,00:26:49.307,"is to remind ourselves how sensitive all of us are"
00:26:49.340,00:26:52.010,"to features of the situation,"
00:26:52.043,00:26:53.445,"even if we feel in our heart of hearts"
00:26:53.478,00:26:56.381,"-like there's no way we could ever have wound up doing it. -Yeah."
00:26:56.414,00:26:59.017,"That is probably the number-one lesson,"
00:26:59.050,00:27:01.919,"and I'm so grateful to the participants we had here today"
00:27:01.952,00:27:04.922,"who helped us illustrate that, because without the illustrations,"
00:27:04.955,00:27:07.859,"it's just a word in a textbook."
00:27:07.892,00:27:08.326,"Right."
00:27:12.163,00:27:14.899,"We are all capable of doing things"
00:27:14.932,00:27:17.902,"we'd never expect ourselves to do."
00:27:17.935,00:27:21.105,"And the choices that you make"
00:27:21.138,00:27:23.908,"can have less to do with how good or bad"
00:27:23.941,00:27:25.343,"you are as a person,"
00:27:25.376,00:27:29.280,"and more to do with how you've acted recently."
00:27:29.313,00:27:31.249,"Now, that might sound unfortunate,"
00:27:31.282,00:27:34.819,"but we are imperfect creatures."
00:27:34.852,00:27:36.320,"And that's nothing to be ashamed of,"
00:27:36.353,00:27:39.357,"because we are also curious."
00:27:39.390,00:27:43.127,"And the more we learn about why and how"
00:27:43.160,00:27:45.963,"we make the moral choices that we do,"
00:27:45.996,00:27:47.198,"the better we'll be able to tackle"
00:27:47.231,00:27:51.102,"difficult questions in the future."
00:27:51.135,00:27:53.237,"And, as always,"
00:27:53.270,00:27:54.239,"thanks for watching."
