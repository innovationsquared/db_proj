00:15:14.145,00:15:16.415,"Well, autism is an added factor."

00:15:19.050,00:15:20.585,"<i>And in Derek's case, of course,</i>"

00:15:22.454,00:15:25.290,"And what autism tends to do is to give children"
00:15:25.323,00:15:28.560,"<i>this immense focus on the sheer quality of things,</i>"
00:15:28.593,00:15:30.362,"<i>whether it's a sound or a--</i>"
00:15:30.395,00:15:32.564,"<i>or a color or a scent.</i>"
00:15:32.597,00:15:34.700,"<i>That's the quality that we all have as babies,</i>"
00:15:34.733,00:15:38.637,"<i>that we experience the world in this sheer perception.</i>"
00:15:38.670,00:15:42.474,"Now most babies very quickly come out of that"
00:15:42.507,00:15:44.109,"by 12, 18 months."
00:15:44.142,00:15:45.978,"They're starting to categorize things"
00:15:46.011,00:15:48.613,"just to make sense of the amount of information that's coming in."
00:15:48.646,00:15:50.615,"So you're born, and your body is, like,"
00:15:50.648,00:15:53.352,"consuming all of this sense data raw."
00:15:53.385,00:15:56.221,"-Yeah. -[Michael] And then it learns that's crazy."
00:15:56.254,00:15:58.490,"<i> We don't need to process  every little detail.</i>"
00:15:58.523,00:16:00.425,"<i> We only need to understand  what's important</i>"
00:16:00.458,00:16:03.228,"<i> or relevant,  and that's enough.</i>"
00:16:03.261,00:16:05.063,"[Adam]<i> It's called categorical perception,</i>"
00:16:05.096,00:16:06.531,"<i>and that is a much more efficient way</i>"
00:16:06.564,00:16:07.666,"of processing information, and of course"
00:16:07.699,00:16:09.267,"that's why the brain does it."
00:16:09.300,00:16:12.004,"<i>But autistic children, they hang on to those</i>"
00:16:12.037,00:16:13.605,"<i>absolute qualities for longer.</i>"

00:16:22.580,00:16:26.685,"but it's built on this-- on this foundation of perceptual"
00:16:26.718,00:16:29.088,"vividness that we can only grasp at."

00:16:39.597,00:16:42.134,"<i> Derek is able to do  this with ease,</i>"
00:16:42.167,00:16:44.302,"<i> which means  he can decipher more notes</i>"

00:16:46.671,00:16:48.040,"So we could do that. If I..."
00:16:48.073,00:16:49.441,"Actually, I have-- I have hands."

00:17:08.293,00:17:10.062,"[Adam] Well, the fiddling was to make it--"
00:17:10.095,00:17:12.064,"because he couldn't reach them all at the same time."
00:17:12.097,00:17:13.565,"-[Michael] Right. -[Adam] So his-- he was splitting them up."
00:17:13.598,00:17:15.667,"[Michael] He's just playing-- but they were all--"
00:17:15.700,00:17:18.804,"they were all in there. He just couldn't all play them at once."

00:17:36.187,00:17:37.556,"-[Derek] I'm not sure. -[Adam] Have a guess."
00:17:37.589,00:17:39.524,"How many do you think?"
00:17:39.557,00:17:41.726,"-Is it one? -[Adam] Yeah, a bit more than one."
00:17:41.759,00:17:44.863,"-So there's one. -One, two, three,"
00:17:44.896,00:17:48.733,"four, five, six."
00:17:48.766,00:17:51.369,"-[Adam] Six, weren't there? Right. -[Derek] There's six, Adam."
00:17:51.402,00:17:53.505,"[Adam] Good. Now try this one then, Derek."
00:17:53.538,00:17:55.807,"Ready and..."
00:17:55.840,00:17:58.243,"[Derek] Is it one note, Adam?"
00:17:58.276,00:18:00.412,"[Adam] No, there are five. One, two, three, four, five."
00:18:00.445,00:18:02.180,"[Derek] One, two, three, four, five."
00:18:02.213,00:18:04.249,"It is one, two, three, four, five, Adam."
00:18:06.284,00:18:07.519,"[Michael]<i> Tell me more  about how limited</i>"
00:18:07.552,00:18:10.355,"Derek's everyday abilities are."
00:18:10.388,00:18:12.724,"Derek finds almost everything"
00:18:12.757,00:18:16.128,"that you or I do without thinking really difficult."
00:18:16.161,00:18:19.631,"<i>So self-care, things like getting dressed,</i>"
00:18:19.664,00:18:22.300,"<i>getting washed in the morning are tricky for him.</i>"
00:18:22.333,00:18:24.903,"<i>So all those things that we take for granted,</i>"
00:18:24.936,00:18:26.805,"<i>he finds really difficult.</i>"
00:18:26.838,00:18:28.306,"-[Cynthia] Derek? -[Derek] Yes?"
00:18:28.339,00:18:29.608,"[Cynthia] We'll have to clean your mouth."
00:18:29.641,00:18:31.877,"[Derek] Could you clean my mouth now, Cynthia?"
00:18:31.910,00:18:33.612,"[Cynthia] Yes. Can you come to the sink?"
00:18:33.645,00:18:35.413,"[Derek] I can come to the sink."
00:18:35.446,00:18:37.582,"<i> [Adam] And in fact,  38 years on, we're saying</i>"

00:18:47.759,00:18:50.228,"So things that we would find inconceivably difficult,"
00:18:50.261,00:18:51.696,"Derek does it as easy as breathing."
00:18:51.729,00:18:54.166,"And if you ask him, ""Derek, how'd you do that?"""
00:18:54.199,00:18:55.400,"he has no idea,"

00:18:57.502,00:18:59.604,"how we breathe or how we speak or..."
00:18:59.637,00:19:01.306,"-Yeah. -It's purely intuitive."

00:19:24.429,00:19:26.631,"about this thing in our head?"
00:19:26.664,00:19:28.567,"I think what Derek's example tells us"
00:19:28.600,00:19:31.736,"is the almost infinite capacity of the human brain"
00:19:31.769,00:19:33.738,"to not only survive"
00:19:33.771,00:19:37.209,"but thrive in incredibly difficult circumstances."
00:19:37.242,00:19:39.444,"And Derek's potential"
00:19:39.477,00:19:41.513,"really was no different from anyone else's."
00:19:41.546,00:19:44.783,"There's no one in his family who were particularly musical."
00:19:44.816,00:19:46.651,"So in a sense, you could say that we all have"
00:19:46.684,00:19:48.853,"Derek's potential when we're born."
00:19:48.886,00:19:51.756,"But fortunately, of course, we don't have his disadvantages"
00:19:51.789,00:19:55.260,"and what gave Derek his massive advantage"
00:19:55.293,00:19:56.995,"is at the cost of his disadvantages."
00:19:57.028,00:20:00.332,"[upbeat music playing]"

00:20:10.908,00:20:13.778,"<i>is that it's at least partially  due to an abnormality</i>"
00:20:13.811,00:20:15.780,"<i>in the brain's left hemisphere,</i>"
00:20:15.813,00:20:19.317,"<i> permitting a vast amount  of sensory details</i>"

00:20:21.586,00:20:25.390,"<i>Neurotypical brains may receive  all the same sensory details</i>"
00:20:25.423,00:20:29.527,"<i>but block them from awareness.</i>"
00:20:29.560,00:20:32.330,"In fact, some psychologists have even proposed"
00:20:32.363,00:20:35.267,"that all of us have savant skills"
00:20:35.300,00:20:37.836,"lying dormant in our brains."
00:20:37.869,00:20:39.504,"And they may be on to something,"
00:20:39.537,00:20:41.706,"because in extraordinarily rare cases,"
00:20:41.739,00:20:45.010,"people can actually acquire savant skills."
00:20:45.043,00:20:47.712,"A very small number of people have what is called"
00:20:47.745,00:20:50.582,"Acquired Savant Syndrome."
00:20:50.615,00:20:52.817,"These are people who suffered some sort of brain damage"
00:20:52.850,00:20:54.719,"as adults and their brain damage"
00:20:54.752,00:20:57.555,"actually unlocked skills and abilities"
00:20:57.588,00:20:59.391,"that weren't there before."
00:20:59.424,00:21:01.826,"<i> Jason Padgett  is one such acquired savant.</i>"

00:21:05.830,00:21:08.566,"<i> Jason started seeing precise  geometric patterns</i>"

00:21:10.068,00:21:13.071,"<i> which led to an intuitive  perception of math</i>"
00:21:13.104,00:21:15.640,"<i> and physics  that he never had before.</i>"
00:21:15.673,00:21:17.509,"How did you get a brain injury?"
00:21:17.542,00:21:19.511,"So I was at a karaoke bar, and as we left,"
00:21:19.544,00:21:21.346,"these two guys that were in there singing"
00:21:21.379,00:21:22.681,"attacked me from behind."
00:21:22.714,00:21:24.683,"They smashed me in the back of the head."
00:21:24.716,00:21:25.950,"Well, I just heard this deep thud,"
00:21:25.983,00:21:27.085,"saw a little puff of white light,"
00:21:27.118,00:21:28.720,"which I later found out was my brain"
00:21:28.753,00:21:30.355,"bouncing on the inside of my skull."
00:21:30.388,00:21:32.424,"I didn't know where I was, how I got there,"
00:21:32.457,00:21:33.758,"why I was being attacked."
00:21:33.791,00:21:35.927,"[Michael] So now you have Akinetopsia,"
00:21:35.960,00:21:39.964,"meaning you see the world now in frames."
00:21:39.997,00:21:42.701,"-What does that mean? -In discreet picture frames."
00:21:42.734,00:21:44.736,"When I say discreetly, I mean seeing one picture"
00:21:44.769,00:21:46.438,"and another picture. So imagine like anybody"
00:21:46.471,00:21:48.039,"<i>watching TV right now, they can hit pause</i>"
00:21:48.072,00:21:49.841,"<i>and pause again and see the picture frame</i>"
00:21:49.874,00:21:51.576,"<i>by frame by frame.</i>"
00:21:51.609,00:21:53.712,"<i>It's just like that, but in real time.</i>"
00:21:53.745,00:21:55.747,"It also makes everything look slightly pixelated."
00:21:55.780,00:21:58.416,"So boundaries of objects don't look curved"
00:21:58.449,00:21:59.751,"like smooth curves anymore."
00:21:59.784,00:22:00.952,"They look like they have these tiny"
00:22:00.985,00:22:02.554,"little straight line edges."
00:22:02.587,00:22:03.888,"Are you seeing me that way right now?"
00:22:03.921,00:22:06.424,"Yes. So like, if you're not moving,"
00:22:06.457,00:22:08.793,"it's more like a picture on a picture on a picture,"
00:22:08.826,00:22:10.462,"so it's not nearly as profound,"
00:22:10.495,00:22:12.397,"but when something moves like this,"
00:22:12.430,00:22:13.732,"then it's much more profound."
00:22:13.765,00:22:15.133,"So after the injury,"
00:22:15.166,00:22:17.669,"you have all these perceptual changes."
00:22:17.702,00:22:20.772,"What makes you decide that you need to start drawing?"
00:22:20.805,00:22:23.541,"So at the time, I had no way to describe"
00:22:23.574,00:22:25.677,"what I was seeing in any terms"
00:22:25.710,00:22:27.078,"except for to draw it."
00:22:27.111,00:22:28.747,"<i>I started trying to define things</i>"
00:22:28.780,00:22:30.915,"<i>with triangles and straight lines.</i>"
00:22:30.948,00:22:34.652,"Geometry is-- to me is the one thing everything has,"
00:22:34.685,00:22:37.489,"even nothing. Empty space is geometry."
00:22:37.522,00:22:38.690,"It just seemed obvious."
00:22:38.723,00:22:40.925,"I mean, the universe is math for me."
00:22:40.958,00:22:43.495,"<i> [Michael] Are these  thoughts that you would've  had before the injury?</i>"
00:22:43.528,00:22:45.797,"No, not at all. Never even contemplated"
00:22:45.830,00:22:48.833,"this type of stuff and now I can't stop thinking about it"
00:22:48.866,00:22:50.135,"and I wound up going to the mall."
00:22:50.168,00:22:51.603,"So I'm sitting there eating this sandwich"
00:22:51.636,00:22:53.138,"and I'm drawing, and this guy next to me,"
00:22:53.171,00:22:54.839,"he says he's a physicist. And he goes,"
00:22:54.872,00:22:56.808,"""It looks like you're doing some sort of math there."""
00:22:56.841,00:22:58.810,"And I started telling him, you know, my ideas."
00:22:58.843,00:23:01.079,"And he says ""It sounds to me like you're trying to describe"
00:23:01.112,00:23:03.415,"space, time, and limits."""
00:23:03.448,00:23:05.083,"And things that I didn't understand what he was talking about."
00:23:05.116,00:23:06.818,"He goes, ""But you're doing it in layman terms"
00:23:06.851,00:23:08.887,"""and I've never heard anybody try to do that before."""
00:23:08.920,00:23:10.188,"It turns out it was integrals."
00:23:10.221,00:23:12.424,"What I was doing was integrals and calculus."
00:23:12.457,00:23:14.659,"You're now pursuing an education in math?"
00:23:14.692,00:23:16.861,"-[Jason] Yes. -So would you say that"
00:23:16.894,00:23:20.432,"you're still the same person"
00:23:20.465,00:23:22.066,"who existed before the injury,"
00:23:22.099,00:23:24.903,"or did you become a different individual?"
00:23:24.936,00:23:27.105,"I feel like I've had two different lives."
00:23:27.138,00:23:29.541,"Before the injury, I didn't have any background in math."
00:23:29.574,00:23:30.942,"I didn't even have algebra."
00:23:30.975,00:23:32.911,"I didn't even know that you could graph a line."
00:23:32.944,00:23:35.814,"<i>All I did was party and chase girls.</i>"
00:23:35.847,00:23:37.782,"<i>It was a very shallow, you know,</i>"
00:23:37.815,00:23:40.018,"<i>almost blissfully ignorant life.</i>"
00:23:40.051,00:23:42.754,"Do you think that these abilities"
00:23:42.787,00:23:44.456,"were always in your brain"
00:23:44.489,00:23:46.891,"and got somehow unlocked by the injury,"
00:23:46.924,00:23:49.794,"or did the injury give you something new?"
00:23:49.827,00:23:53.097,"I 100% believe that we all have this in us."
00:23:53.130,00:23:54.999,"You know, people think that I got hit in the head"
00:23:55.032,00:23:56.835,"and just magically got good at math"
00:23:56.868,00:23:58.870,"<i>but a lot of it is your brain gets damaged</i>"
00:23:58.903,00:24:01.506,"<i>and you're forced to see the world differently,</i>"
00:24:01.539,00:24:02.774,"and by seeing the world differently,"
00:24:02.807,00:24:04.509,"it makes you think differently."
