00:00:06.338,00:00:07.473,"[Michael] <i>When I spoke with Dave Eshelman</i>"
00:00:07.506,00:00:10.243,"<i> about his role as a Stanford  Prison Experiment guard,</i>"
00:00:10.276,00:00:12.278,"<i> he told me  about the inspiration</i>"
00:00:12.311,00:00:14.614,"<i> for his infamous persona.</i>"
00:00:14.647,00:00:17.116,"[film narrator] <i> The guards were not allowed  to beat the prisoners,</i>"
00:00:17.149,00:00:19.519,"<i> so they fell back on the  familiar military technique</i>"
00:00:19.552,00:00:22.455,"<i> of ordering push-ups  to humiliate them.</i>"
00:00:22.488,00:00:24.624,"[Dave] My role model, I pulled it from two places."
00:00:24.657,00:00:27.527,"I'd just gone through fraternity hazing."
00:00:27.560,00:00:29.562,"-Ah, yeah. -And the second thing is,"
00:00:29.595,00:00:32.165,"I had just seen the movie <i> Cool Hand Luke.</i>"
00:00:32.198,00:00:34.434,"And the prison warden is this great character actor"
00:00:34.467,00:00:36.669,"named Strother Martin."
00:00:36.702,00:00:40.506,"And he was famous for his line that went,"
00:00:40.539,00:00:46.212,"""Now, boys, what we have here is a failure to communicate."""
00:00:46.245,00:00:48.247,"Not just the line, but the accent is famous."
00:00:48.280,00:00:52.218,"And you adopted an accent in this experiment."
00:00:58.891,00:01:01.160,"[Dave] You know, I figured, I'm going to be"
00:01:01.193,00:01:04.731,"one goddamn mean sumbitch Southern guard."
00:01:08.434,00:01:10.570,"[film narrator] <i> That's prisoner 416  on the floor,</i>"
00:01:10.603,00:01:12.605,"<i> as he was forced  into solitary.</i>"
00:01:16.509,00:01:19.245,"What name did you go by during the experiment?"
00:01:19.278,00:01:21.347,"Well, I found out later"
00:01:21.380,00:01:23.816,"that they started calling me John Wayne."
00:01:23.849,00:01:26.619,"John Wayne. How did that nickname come about?"
00:01:26.652,00:01:28.387,"Well, it's interesting how that happened,"
00:01:28.420,00:01:29.889,"because, you know, John Wayne,"
00:01:29.922,00:01:33.392,"he was seen as the establishment, the enemy."
00:01:33.425,00:01:35.628,"Most of the kids in my generation,"
00:01:35.661,00:01:39.165,"they were out protesting against the war in Vietnam."
00:01:39.198,00:01:42.268,"John Wayne, the actor, who had come out in favor..."
00:01:42.301,00:01:43.870,"-Yeah. -...of the war in Vietnam."
00:01:43.903,00:01:47.807,"So immediately, to us kids, he was evil."
00:01:47.840,00:01:49.842,"Right. John Wayne was not a hero."
00:01:49.875,00:01:52.245,"No, he was not a hero to these kids."
00:01:52.278,00:01:54.247,"Somehow, that name stuck to me."
00:01:54.280,00:01:56.382,"But, you know, I don't think John Wayne ever played a part"
00:01:56.415,00:01:57.650,"like the one that I'm playing here."
00:01:57.683,00:01:59.218,"-No, no. -In fact, at the end,"
00:01:59.251,00:02:02.155,"Zimbardo made it a point to come over to me"
00:02:02.188,00:02:04.257,"and say, ""You were fantastic."""
00:02:04.290,00:02:06.726,"-Like a director might. Right. -Like a director might,"
00:02:06.759,00:02:08.761,"you know, at the end of a performance."
00:02:08.794,00:02:10.530,"Have you done any media appearances"
00:02:10.563,00:02:13.199,"since the Ben Blum article came out?"
00:02:13.232,00:02:14.767,"No."
00:02:14.800,00:02:16.869,"So, what was your reaction to those new criticisms?"
00:02:16.902,00:02:20.339,"Well, I felt like the Dude in<i> The Big Lebowski</i>"
00:02:20.372,00:02:23.209,"when he said, ""New shit has come to light, man."""
00:02:23.242,00:02:25.278,"-[laughs] Yeah. -Basically, I'm saying,"
00:02:25.311,00:02:27.313,"This is what I've been telling people"
00:02:27.346,00:02:29.382,"from the very beginning,"
00:02:29.415,00:02:31.951,"that doesn't make it into the final cut."
00:02:31.984,00:02:33.353,"Right."
