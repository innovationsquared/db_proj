00:00:12.910,00:00:16.250,are also responsible for what's called the moon,2015-06-07
00:00:16.250,00:00:18.430,terminator illusion.,2015-06-07
00:00:20.590,00:00:23.630,A terminator is the line between an illuminated,2015-06-07
00:00:23.630,00:00:26.690,and dark side. Light arrives,2015-06-07
00:00:26.690,00:00:30.300,perpendicular to the terminator but it doesn't always,2015-06-07
00:00:30.300,00:00:34.040,appear to. Maybe you've noticed this before. When the Moon,2015-06-07
00:00:34.040,00:00:37.510,"and the Sun are up at the same time, and a good distance apart",2015-06-07

00:00:43.809,00:00:48.069,with the position of the Sun. What's going on here?,2015-06-07
00:00:49.120,00:00:50.879,The answer lies,2015-06-07
00:00:50.879,00:00:54.729,"in visual angles. The further away from you something is,",2015-06-07
00:00:54.729,00:00:59.979,"the smaller it will appear to be. In psychophysical terms, its visual angle",2015-06-07
00:00:59.979,00:01:04.370,shrinks - the angle within your field of view that it stretches across.,2015-06-07
00:01:04.370,00:01:08.210,"Now, this means that everything we look at is foreshortened,",2015-06-07

00:01:12.100,00:01:15.540,A line infinitely far away. Things that far away,2015-06-07
00:01:15.540,00:01:18.630,are foreshortened to the point at which they have no height,2015-06-07
00:01:18.630,00:01:21.720,whatsoever. This distortion,2015-06-07
00:01:21.720,00:01:25.790,"affects everything that we look at. But it doesn't confuse us, because",2015-06-07
00:01:25.790,00:01:30.220,our brains know about it. We can look at an object that is foreshortened and,2015-06-07
00:01:30.220,00:01:33.390,figure out what it probably actually looks like.,2015-06-07
00:01:33.620,00:01:36.800,"For example, a door is a rectangle,",2015-06-07
00:01:36.800,00:01:39.950,but it's wrecked by foreshortening when,2015-06-07
00:01:39.950,00:01:43.710,opened. Closer distances appear larger. The whole shape,2015-06-07

00:01:53.110,00:01:56.450,different actual things. It's called subjective,2015-06-07
00:01:56.450,00:02:00.580,constancy. Our brains cleverly factor in previous,2015-06-07
00:02:00.580,00:02:04.570,experience and perspective clues from the surrounding world,2015-06-07

00:02:25.130,00:02:28.990,"okay to you. However, if we frame in really closely",2015-06-07
00:02:28.990,00:02:32.730,"and remove surrounding perspective clues, I can be made to look",2015-06-07

00:02:44.510,00:02:48.090,is probably the crux of the Moon terminator,2015-06-07
00:02:48.090,00:02:51.340,illusion. Take a look at this.,2015-06-07
00:02:51.340,00:02:54.420,The line where that wall meets the ceiling,2015-06-07
00:02:54.420,00:02:57.630,"is a straight line. Seriously, take a look.",2015-06-07

00:03:04.590,00:03:07.780,ceilings. But that's not what your eye,2015-06-07
00:03:07.780,00:03:10.890,senses. A camera will help,2015-06-07
00:03:10.890,00:03:15.130,demonstrate this. It doesn't add in the post sensation processing that our,2015-06-07

00:03:15.930,00:03:19.890,and we can also frame in to remove other clues telling us what to think.,2015-06-07
00:03:19.890,00:03:23.250,"Now, sure enough, right in front of us the line is",2015-06-07
00:03:23.250,00:03:26.600,level with the screen of the camera - it's a straight line - but,2015-06-07
00:03:26.600,00:03:31.040,"if we move our eyes across the line, look what happens. If I pan this way,",2015-06-07
00:03:31.040,00:03:35.209,the slope changes and now the line appears to be going,2015-06-07
00:03:35.209,00:03:38.320,up and to the left. And if I panned,2015-06-07

00:03:47.540,00:03:51.099,that's what a curved line does.,2015-06-07
00:03:51.099,00:03:54.859,Just like the curve we think we see between the Sun,2015-06-07
00:03:54.859,00:03:57.859,and the Moon. But wait. If,2015-06-07

00:04:04.920,00:04:08.329,here's a clue. Clues.,2015-06-07
00:04:08.980,00:04:12.659,We know what rooms are supposed to look like. We know how they're built. We have,2015-06-07
00:04:12.659,00:04:15.280,experience with them and there are other things in the environment,2015-06-07
00:04:15.280,00:04:20.030,"helping us. But when you look at the sky, there's not much to help you.",2015-06-07
00:04:20.030,00:04:24.370,"In the absence of clues about distance and perspective, our brains assume that",2015-06-07
00:04:24.370,00:04:25.789,whatever we're looking at is,2015-06-07
00:04:25.789,00:04:29.570,"equidistant from us, making the sky a sort of",2015-06-07

00:04:32.669,00:04:36.789,"The only clue we have then is the horizon, but it's a red herring,",2015-06-07
00:04:36.789,00:04:41.110,because the horizon doesn't foreshorten. It's just a place where,2015-06-07
00:04:41.110,00:04:44.770,due to foreshortening everything becomes infinitely flat.,2015-06-07
00:04:44.770,00:04:48.729,Brian Rogers and Olga Naumenko  demonstrated that these things result,2015-06-07
00:04:48.729,00:04:52.400,in the terminator illusion by using a planetarium.,2015-06-07
00:04:52.400,00:04:57.240,"They projected two dots onto its dome, mimicking our perception of the Sun",2015-06-07
00:04:57.240,00:05:01.389,and the Moon. They've then asked participants to place a third dot on the,2015-06-07
00:05:01.389,00:05:02.860,straight line connecting them.,2015-06-07
00:05:02.860,00:05:06.260,"But just as in the Moon terminator illusion, people",2015-06-07
00:05:06.260,00:05:10.690,incorrectly placed the third dot. They were influenced by a desire to stay,2015-06-07
00:05:10.690,00:05:12.580,"parallel to the horizon,",2015-06-07
00:05:12.580,00:05:17.169,as if it was subject to the same foreshortening rules. Our brains also,2015-06-07
00:05:17.169,00:05:21.580,"often fail to factor in foreshortening when it comes to crepuscular rays,",2015-06-07

00:05:33.460,00:05:38.780,and these lines are actually pretty much exactly parallel.,2015-06-07
00:05:38.780,00:05:42.890,It's true. They look like they converge for the same reason railroad tracks,2015-06-07
00:05:42.890,00:05:44.080,appear to converge.,2015-06-07
00:05:44.080,00:05:47.340,The visual angle of the distance separating them,2015-06-07
00:05:47.340,00:05:51.090,shrinks the further down you look. Sometimes,2015-06-07
00:05:51.090,00:05:54.850,our brains do the opposite. They assume,2015-06-07
00:05:54.850,00:05:58.180,and consider foreshortening even when it isn't,2015-06-07
00:05:58.180,00:06:01.260,"really there, like in this illusion, where",2015-06-07
00:06:01.260,00:06:05.990,the cars seem to be different sizes but in actuality on the page,2015-06-07
00:06:05.990,00:06:11.210,"are all the same size. Everything else in the image is affected by foreshortening,",2015-06-07
00:06:11.210,00:06:15.860,so our brains assume that the cars are too and decide that in order for them,2015-06-07
00:06:15.860,00:06:19.190,"all to have the same visual angle, which they do,",2015-06-07
00:06:19.190,00:06:22.800,the more distant ones must be literally larger,2015-06-07
00:06:22.800,00:06:26.260,in real life. The rate at which the visual angle,2015-06-07
00:06:26.260,00:06:30.110,"of something you are looking at changes as you move toward it, or away from it,",2015-06-07
00:06:30.110,00:06:33.340,is not constant. In order to cut the visual,2015-06-07
00:06:33.340,00:06:36.720,"angle of an object in half, its distance from you",2015-06-07
00:06:36.720,00:06:39.840,must double. That means objects,2015-06-07
00:06:39.840,00:06:44.880,really really far away require a lot more movement to have their visual angle,2015-06-07
00:06:44.880,00:06:47.600,changed compared to nearer objects.,2015-06-07
00:06:47.600,00:06:51.160,This is called parallax and it's a major reason,2015-06-07
00:06:51.160,00:06:54.210,moving allows us to learn so much about,2015-06-07
00:06:54.210,00:06:57.290,depth. It's why stuff on the side of the road,2015-06-07
00:06:57.290,00:07:01.800,"whizzes is by you as you drive past, while distant features of the landscape",2015-06-07
00:07:01.800,00:07:06.320,"appear to only crawl past. A really distant thing, like,",2015-06-07

00:07:21.859,00:07:26.309,moving a camera through space will affect the visual angle of nearer,2015-06-07

00:07:26.859,00:07:29.999,like the Vsauce mug here much more dramatically than,2015-06-07
00:07:29.999,00:07:33.609,"distant things, like Jake Chudnow's album against the wall.",2015-06-07
00:07:33.609,00:07:36.689,It is barely changing size as we move back,2015-06-07

00:07:43.539,00:07:46.919,"regardless of depth. Notice that when zooming,",2015-06-07
00:07:46.919,00:07:51.959,"the distant album grows and shrinks right along with the mug. Now, if you move",2015-06-07

00:07:55.169,00:07:58.339,the zoom will be most apparent when looking at distant,2015-06-07
00:07:58.339,00:08:01.939,"things, while the move more apparent on near things.",2015-06-07
00:08:01.939,00:08:05.939,The result can be trippy. Here I've been placed where both,2015-06-07
00:08:05.939,00:08:09.839,"effects cancel each other out, so everything around me changes",2015-06-07
00:08:09.839,00:08:14.139,instead. Another great illusion that takes advantage of parallax,2015-06-07
00:08:14.139,00:08:17.599,is the popular star field or hallway illusion.,2015-06-07
00:08:17.599,00:08:21.179,Cover the middle of the video and you'll appear to be moving,2015-06-07
00:08:21.179,00:08:25.469,"much faster. But you if cover the edges, you'll appear to be moving",2015-06-07
00:08:25.469,00:08:29.629,much slower. All you're doing is altering the perspective clues your brain,2015-06-07
00:08:29.629,00:08:30.289,receives,2015-06-07
00:08:30.289,00:08:33.620,about movement. The nearer stuff at the edge,2015-06-07
00:08:33.620,00:08:36.959,changes position faster than the distance stuff way ahead.,2015-06-07
00:08:36.959,00:08:39.990,So if you cover the slow distance stuff your brain,2015-06-07
00:08:39.990,00:08:44.970,only has the faster moving stuff to judge speed from. But cover the faster,2015-06-07
00:08:44.970,00:08:48.290,near stuff and the slower stuff becomes the new,2015-06-07
00:08:48.290,00:08:52.350,near. Your brain assumes that you've slowed down.,2015-06-07
00:08:52.580,00:08:56.059,The optics and mathematics behind all of these effects,2015-06-07
00:08:56.060,00:08:59.329,were understood at least thousands of years ago.,2015-06-07
00:08:59.329,00:09:02.959,"During the Renaissance, artists used that knowledge to produce",2015-06-07

00:09:24.660,00:09:26.710,all what such a scene would actually,2015-06-07
00:09:26.710,00:09:31.920,look like. Artists and viewers contemporary to works like that,2015-06-07
