00:01:25.570,00:01:29.010,with a lot of certainty. What's really cool though,2015-03-07
00:01:29.010,00:01:32.990,"is that if you embrace that uncertainty, a simple argument",2015-03-07
00:01:32.990,00:01:37.330,can show that human extinction soon is actually,2015-03-07
00:01:37.330,00:01:41.360,more probable. It's called the Doomsday,2015-03-07
00:01:41.360,00:01:44.380,argument. Imagine a giant,2015-03-07
00:01:44.380,00:01:47.540,urn that contains either 10 balls,2015-03-07
00:01:47.540,00:01:51.259,"numbered 1 to 10, or a million balls",2015-03-07

00:01:58.000,00:02:01.289,one ball. You go ahead and do that,2015-03-07
00:02:01.289,00:02:05.770,and it is ball number 4.,2015-03-07
00:02:05.770,00:02:10.000,That's pretty strong evidence in favour of the 10 ball condition,2015-03-07
00:02:10.000,00:02:13.750,because drawing a four from a set of 1 through 10,2015-03-07
00:02:13.750,00:02:18.370,is a one in 10 chance. But drawing four from a million different numbers,2015-03-07
00:02:18.370,00:02:21.650,is a one in a million chance.,2015-03-07
00:02:21.650,00:02:25.100,By analogy you are also a numbered,2015-03-07
00:02:25.110,00:02:28.470,ball. You are a human who knows,2015-03-07
00:02:28.470,00:02:31.790,approximately what your birth number is.,2015-03-07
00:02:31.790,00:02:35.049,It's probably somewhere around 100,2015-03-07
00:02:35.049,00:02:38.120,billion. That's how many other humans,2015-03-07
00:02:38.120,00:02:41.540,were most likely born before you were.,2015-03-07
00:02:41.540,00:02:45.040,"Importantly, you didn't get to decide which birth number",2015-03-07
00:02:45.040,00:02:49.170,"you would have. So, just like the number for a ball,",2015-03-07
00:02:49.170,00:02:53.420,you are a random sample from the set of all humans,2015-03-07
00:02:53.420,00:02:57.549,who will ever live. The Doomsday argument points out,2015-03-07
00:02:57.549,00:03:02.519,that from 200 billion people there's a 50 percent chance that a randomly chosen,2015-03-07

00:03:27.050,00:03:30.390,or your birth number is to be expected,2015-03-07
00:03:30.390,00:03:33.840,because there will not be tens of trillions of humans.,2015-03-07

00:03:47.240,00:03:50.730,uncontroversial. One problem it might have,2015-03-07
00:03:50.730,00:03:54.560,is a reference class problem. Are you really a,2015-03-07
00:03:54.560,00:03:57.920,random sample from the set of all humans who will ever,2015-03-07

00:04:03.020,00:04:06.420,humans will be quite different than they are today.,2015-03-07

00:04:13.800,00:04:17.660,with that trait could be evidence that you aren't a random sample from the,2015-03-07

00:04:36.060,00:04:39.630,over those threats in the future. It just assumes that,2015-03-07
00:04:39.630,00:04:43.180,we don't know which way the balance will lie; that,2015-03-07

00:04:46.610,00:04:52.530,later are equally likely. But maybe you don't believe that.,2015-03-07
