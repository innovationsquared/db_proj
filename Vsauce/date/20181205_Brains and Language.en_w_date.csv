00:02:32.351,00:02:35.454,What we do know about language is that most of the brain,2018-12-05
00:02:35.487,00:02:37.723,is actually involved in some aspect of it.,2018-12-05
00:02:37.756,00:02:41.594,-Yeah. -You really need the whole working cerebral cortex,2018-12-05

00:03:03.916,00:03:07.286,"-Wow. -Or very, very similar. Obviously, this is larger,",2018-12-05

00:03:21.000,00:03:25.238,are not fundamentally different in their structure and their circuitry and so on.,2018-12-05
00:03:25.271,00:03:28.507,"-Yeah. -I think in the absence of language, we would",2018-12-05
00:03:28.540,00:03:31.911,"-probably be like chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and so on. -Right.",2018-12-05
00:03:31.944,00:03:36.549,"But yet, they're able to perform really well at tasks",2018-12-05
00:03:36.582,00:03:39.919,"that seem to look like, ""Did they take a picture or something?""",2018-12-05
00:03:39.952,00:03:45.024,Exactly. Chimpanzees seem to do reasonably well at some of these tasks.,2018-12-05
00:03:45.057,00:03:49.595,But we've traded off that ability in order to focus on language.,2018-12-05
00:03:49.628,00:03:52.798,Because the memory systems we use in language,2018-12-05
00:03:52.831,00:03:55.668,interface with each other in a way that's unusual.,2018-12-05

00:04:09.548,00:04:11.784,I couldn't tell you any of these sentences.,2018-12-05
00:04:11.817,00:04:14.720,"-No. -But if you ask me what's in<i> this</i> book,",2018-12-05
00:04:14.753,00:04:17.623,"what's its main ideas, I can probably give it to you.",2018-12-05
00:04:17.656,00:04:19.959,-That's a remarkable capacity. -Yeah.,2018-12-05
00:04:19.992,00:04:25.765,So what I'm suggesting as the tradeoff is sort of giving up the specific details--,2018-12-05
00:04:25.798,00:04:30.970,to sacrifice it at one level gives it back to us at another level.,2018-12-05
00:04:31.003,00:04:33.306,That's the power that we have gained from this.,2018-12-05
00:04:33.339,00:04:38.844,"Because of that power, we can get at information that no other species can get at,",2018-12-05
