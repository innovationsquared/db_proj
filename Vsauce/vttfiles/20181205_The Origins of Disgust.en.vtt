Being impressed by the cognitive
abilities of a chimpanzee

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:15.081 align:start size:88% position:13%
isn't just good for them,
it is good for us,

00:00:15.114 --> 00:00:18.684
because it helps us learn about
our own evolutionary history.

00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:23.289 align:start size:91% position:9%
Comparing the psychology
of humans to the psychology
of other primates

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:28.728 align:start size:94% position:6%
is a great way to
illuminate what it is we
maintained, lost, or changed

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:31.464
as our brains diverged
from other primates.

00:00:31.497 --> 00:00:35.735
Now, I'm really excited
right now, because in
the spirit of sharing,

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:38.237 align:start size:97% position:3%
The Primate Research Institute
has agreed to show me

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.573
some of the other ways
they're learning about us

00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:45.144
by studying those
who are<i> almost</i> us.

00:00:45.177 --> 00:00:47.246 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> I'm heading to the
 parasite lab to meet up</i>

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:49.615 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> with associate professor
 Andrew McIntosh</i>

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:51.784 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> and doctoral student
 Cecile Serabian.</i>

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:55.421 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> Their work with
 Japanese macaques has
 led them to theorize</i>

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:58.591
<i> that primates' feelings
 of repulsion or disgust</i>

00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:01.828 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> could have served a protective
 purpose in our evolution.</i>

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:04.764 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> To study disgust,
 we will be working with</i>

00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:09.669 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> one the most famous
 disgust inducers: poop.</i>

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:12.705
Andrew, Cecile, thank you
for meeting up with me,

00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:18.177
I can now tell people that
my time in Japan was crappy.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.044
[both chuckle]

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:20.847
[Andrew] Just like
every day for us.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.483 align:start size:94% position:6%
So tell me, why is there
a bunch of poop on the table?

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:26.819 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
Because we were studying
the social behavior

00:01:26.852 --> 00:01:29.188 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
and parasite infection
of the macaques.

00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:30.290 align:start size:69% position:31% line:0%
[Cecile continues]

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:35.829 line:0%
Right.

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:47.440 line:0%
If we want to say that humans
are somehow especially hygienic

00:01:47.473 --> 00:01:52.411 line:0%
or disgusted by those kinds of
objects that might make us sick

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:54.914 align:start size:91% position:9%
It's quite difficult
to separate whether that's

00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:57.416 align:start size:81% position:19%
an evolutionary
response to something

00:01:57.449 --> 00:02:00.586 align:start size:91% position:9%
or just a cultural
phenomenon that we've
kind of created on our own.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.323 align:start size:91% position:9%
[Michael]
Now these are clearly toys.

00:02:04.356 --> 00:02:05.625
They're made of plastic.

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:07.894 align:start size:63% position:38%
These look
kind of different.

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:10.496
Okay, so you have different
types here on the table.

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:12.598 align:start position:0%
This is the type
for carnivores--

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:14.167
it's not the type of primates.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.370 align:start position:0%
Primates have a long-shape
type of poop.

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:19.205 size:78% position:39%
It's called type 9.

00:02:19.238 --> 00:02:21.240 align:start size:91% position:9%
-So those are all--
-Wait, poops have numbers?

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:24.177 align:start size:84% position:16%
-[both chuckle]
-I only know number 2.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:30.283 align:start position:0% line:0%
Why make play poop when you
have plenty of chimps out there
giving you real poop to use?

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.355 line:0%
Ah.

00:02:38.457 --> 00:02:41.661 align:start size:78% position:22% line:0%
-So there's no odor
or texture here.
-Yeah, exactly.

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:44.697 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
And what differences
did you see?

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:47.567 line:0%
[Cecile continues]

00:02:56.508 --> 00:03:00.380 line:0%
Ah, so it's like a surface
to put the food on top of.

00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:09.689 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
-They would avoid the replica?
-Yes.

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:11.324 size:81% position:41% line:0%
[Cecile continues]

00:03:14.927 --> 00:03:17.964 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
[Michael]
Oh, really? Right, right.

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:21.334 align:start size:88% position:13%
If you expose a bunch
of individuals to a range
of different kinds of

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:23.803 align:start size:81% position:19%
avoidance experiments
we found that

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:26.305
those individuals that
are much more hygienic

00:03:26.338 --> 00:03:28.441
actually were exhibiting
lower infection, so...

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:32.411 align:start size:91% position:9%
It sounds like a really
strong argument in support
of the idea that we

00:03:32.444 --> 00:03:34.647
evolved an emotion like disgust

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.417
- or a behavior like avoidance
of infectious-looking stuff.
-<i> Mm-hmm.</i>

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.020 line:92%
-Because it had an advantage.

00:03:41.053 --> 00:03:42.655
-You get infected less.
-[Andrew] That's right.

00:03:42.688 --> 00:03:44.924
So you have some kind
of experiment for me?

00:03:44.957 --> 00:03:46.692 align:start size:69% position:31%
-Yep.
-Is it safe?

00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:49.695 align:start size:81% position:19%
-Let's see.
-Don't play that way!
-[all laugh]

00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:54.867 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> Cecile and Andrew wanted
 to show me just how hard-wired
 our sense of disgust is.</i>

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.836 line:0%
[Cecile] There you go.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.672
Okay. Those are edible?

00:03:59.705 --> 00:04:01.741 align:start size:84% position:16%
-Yes, those are edible.
-Mm-hmm.

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:06.979 align:start size:94% position:6%
-I'm just going to place one
in each of the holes here.
-Okay.

00:04:07.012 --> 00:04:10.483
If you are ready to eat them,
just try to reach out for them.

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:11.651 line:0%
Okay.

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.825 align:start size:56% position:44% line:0%
Okay. Good. Good.

00:04:19.858 --> 00:04:22.495 align:start size:81% position:19%
What do I do once
I pull the treat out?

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:25.665 align:start size:88% position:13%
You will tell us
whether you are ready to
eat it or not, basically.

00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:27.433
Oh, okay.

00:04:27.466 --> 00:04:29.035 align:start size:97% position:3%
-So, you'll put one in there.
-One goes here.

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:30.836
Sure.

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:33.873 align:start size:75% position:25%
-One goes here...
-Okay.

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:35.908 size:78% position:39%
And one goes there.

00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:38.411 align:start size:84% position:16%
All right, I'm going to
start right in the middle.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:45.017
Hmm. All right, so I might just
blow on this before I eat it,

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.919
but I feel pretty
ready to eat it.

00:04:46.952 --> 00:04:49.689 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Yeah?
-Because what I felt was dry,

00:04:49.722 --> 00:04:52.692
and it was solid,
it was like a foam.

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:54.827
Watch.

00:04:56.161 --> 00:04:59.532 align:start position:0%
-Okay.
-Oh, it's really good.
It's got kind of a coffee taste.

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:01.000
So far so good.

00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:02.502
I'm going to go to the left.

00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:06.772
No, I don't want this one.

00:05:06.805 --> 00:05:09.875 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Okay.
-Whoa, you still went for it.

00:05:09.908 --> 00:05:11.677
I still pulled it out.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.412
[sniffing]

00:05:13.445 --> 00:05:15.047
What was it?

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.818 align:start size:81% position:19%
So I'm just going
to set it down. Okay.

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:22.688
Alright, it smells...
it's kind of fishy.

00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:25.424
All right, now...

00:05:25.457 --> 00:05:28.494
[chuckles knowingly]

00:05:28.527 --> 00:05:31.030
I... okay.

00:05:31.063 --> 00:05:35.034 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'll tell you what,
that was disgusting in
terms of how it felt,

00:05:35.067 --> 00:05:39.538
but when I see the color, I see
this kind of bright green color

00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:42.708 align:start size:84% position:16%
that makes me feel less
disgusted actually

00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:45.044 align:start size:91% position:9%
because it's sort of a fun
color and it reminds me

00:05:45.077 --> 00:05:47.680 align:start size:88% position:13%
that it probably
isn't truly contaminated.

00:05:47.713 --> 00:05:50.449 align:start position:0%
But this is the one that
I'm least likely to want to eat.

00:05:50.482 --> 00:05:54.520
Even stronger than the visual
cues or the olfactory cues

00:05:54.553 --> 00:05:58.557 align:start size:94% position:6%
it seemed that that touching
some substrate like this

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.393
gave us the strongest
aversive response.

00:06:00.426 --> 00:06:01.127
Yeah.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.028
So the first one you touched

00:06:03.061 --> 00:06:05.598 align:start size:94% position:6%
-was this piece of foam here.
-Yeah.

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:08.734 align:start size:94% position:6%
-So yeah, it's basically dry.
-Solid.

00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:12.705
Um, then I think you
went here, and that
is called konnyaku.

00:06:12.738 --> 00:06:15.941 align:start size:84% position:16%
[Andrew]
Yeah, konnyaku is a kind of
starch-based gelatin

00:06:15.974 --> 00:06:18.144 align:start size:63% position:38%
which is part of
the cuisine here.

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:21.547 align:start size:81% position:19%
You said it smelled fishy,
so in here you probably
have parts of seaweed.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.616 align:start size:88% position:13%
Yeah, right, that's where
that's coming from.

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:26.485 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's soft, a bit wet,
but not very...

00:06:26.518 --> 00:06:29.188 align:start size:88% position:13%
-It's not sticking to me.
-Not sticky, yeah.

00:06:29.221 --> 00:06:33.426
And the last one here was
what maybe kids in the '90s

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:35.528
including myself
were playing with.

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:36.896
A slime toy.

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:39.698 align:start position:0%
Which is like
slimy and sticky.

00:06:39.731 --> 00:06:42.668 align:start size:78% position:22%
And this,
it's just so gooey.

00:06:42.701 --> 00:06:45.638
Well, and the fact that it's
pink makes it so much more fun

00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:47.039
than if it was like, brown.

00:06:47.072 --> 00:06:48.007
Mm-hmm.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.075 align:start size:88% position:13%
Now, the research you're
doing with macaques,

00:06:50.108 --> 00:06:51.744
is that something
I could observe?

00:06:51.777 --> 00:06:54.180
We'd be willing to take you
out to the macaque habitat

00:06:54.213 --> 00:06:57.016
and we could run some of these
similar experiments with them

00:06:57.049 --> 00:07:00.486 align:start size:94% position:6%
-for you to observe.
-Ooh. I would love to. Yeah.

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:05.057
<i> Cecile's work with macaque
 monkeys on Koujima Island</i>

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.994 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> led her to develop
 an experiment that she
 and Andrew have been running</i>

00:07:09.027 --> 00:07:12.531 align:start position:0%
<i>on the macaques here at
the Primate Research Institute.</i>

00:07:12.564 --> 00:07:15.201
<i> They want to know if
 macaques avoid feces</i>

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:19.738
<i> because a feeling of disgust
 evolved in order to reduce</i>

00:07:19.771 --> 00:07:23.776 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> the risk of their
 exposure to parasites.</i>

00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:26.479
-[Andrew] And here they are.
-[Michael] And here they are.

00:07:26.512 --> 00:07:30.883 align:start size:97% position:3%
Oh look at that,
the babies are so cute.

00:07:30.916 --> 00:07:32.751 align:start position:0%
-Here it's feeding time, almost.
-Mm-hm.

00:07:32.784 --> 00:07:34.987 size:75% position:38%
Which is a good time
for an experiment.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.556 align:start size:75% position:25%
Yeah, we're a bit lucky,
they didn't eat that
much in the morning,

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:40.826
so hopefully they'll have that
extra motivation to participate.

00:07:40.859 --> 00:07:43.229 align:start size:69% position:31%
And we're going to try
to play a bit with
the value of the food,

00:07:43.262 --> 00:07:45.731 align:start size:91% position:9%
-so we'll start with their
regular monkey chow.
-Right.

00:07:45.764 --> 00:07:48.934 align:start size:91% position:9%
Which they see a couple times
a day on a daily basis.

00:07:48.967 --> 00:07:52.771 size:84% position:58% line:0%
And then we'll see what
happens when we introduce
that nice, tasty peanut.

00:07:52.804 --> 00:07:54.573 size:84% position:58% line:0%
[Cecile speaking]

00:07:54.606 --> 00:07:57.276
[Michael] Right. And so, I'm
assuming they like peanuts.

00:07:57.309 --> 00:08:01.046 align:start size:88% position:13%
-Right, so--
-They don't like peanuts
in or on poop.

00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:03.583 align:start size:72% position:28%
Well hopefully, we'll
find that out today.

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:10.155
[Michael] Okay,
so it looks like

00:08:10.188 --> 00:08:12.992 size:88% position:56% line:0%
Andrew is dumping the, um...

00:08:13.025 --> 00:08:14.293 align:start position:0% line:0%
[Cecile]
Those are real feces

00:08:14.326 --> 00:08:17.663 size:75% position:38% line:8%
that he is going to pair
with the replica feces

00:08:17.696 --> 00:08:22.735 line:0%

-[Michael] Near each other?
-[Cecile] Yes, near each other.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.972
Aha, all right.

00:08:27.005 --> 00:08:28.874 align:start size:81% position:19%

-Yeah.

<i> Whether or not the macaques
 eat it may indicate their
 level of disgust.</i>

00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:45.224 align:start size:94% position:6%
[Michael] They're looking...
now here comes one.

00:08:45.257 --> 00:08:46.825 align:start size:88% position:13%
-[Michael] No... oh, oh!
-[Cecile] Yeah.

00:08:46.858 --> 00:08:48.193 align:start position:0%
[Cecile]
No, he's smelling the wood chip.

00:08:48.226 --> 00:08:51.297 align:start position:0%
[Michael]
He smelled the wood chip,
the monkey chow fell off of it.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.299
[Cecile] Yes.

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:56.302 align:start position:0%
[Michael]
Is he... gonna eat it?

00:08:56.335 --> 00:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
No. I think
regular old normal food
on poop is just--

00:09:01.773 --> 00:09:04.643 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
it's a hard sell.

00:09:04.676 --> 00:09:07.846 line:0%
[Andrew over radio]

00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:10.716 align:start size:84% position:16%
[Michael]
Shelled peanuts, okay.

00:09:10.749 --> 00:09:13.319 align:start size:78% position:22%
-[Cecile] So that's
on the fake poop.
-[Michael] Yep.

00:09:13.352 --> 00:09:15.621 align:start size:88% position:13%
-[Michael]
That's on the real poop.
-[Cecile] Yeah.

00:09:15.654 --> 00:09:18.190 align:start size:94% position:6%
-[Michael]
And that's on the wood block.
-[Cecile] Yes.

00:09:18.223 --> 00:09:23.295
<i> This time around, Andrew
 introduces peanuts, which
 the macaques really love.</i>

00:09:23.328 --> 00:09:26.632 align:start position:0%
<i>Will this special treat
override their inner instincts?</i>

00:09:26.665 --> 00:09:29.001 align:start size:78% position:22%
Oh, oh, they're
already running in.

00:09:31.403 --> 00:09:33.139
[both] Ooh.

00:09:34.339 --> 00:09:36.208 size:88% position:44%
[Michael] But he threw it.

00:09:36.241 --> 00:09:39.345 align:start size:88% position:13%
-And he's washing it now.
-He's washing it.

00:09:39.378 --> 00:09:40.913 align:start size:94% position:6%
All right, here
comes another one.

00:09:40.946 --> 00:09:42.281
Oh, he went for the poop one!

00:09:42.314 --> 00:09:44.216 size:84% position:58%
-[Cecile] Yeah.
-[Michael laughs]

00:09:44.249 --> 00:09:46.685 size:78% position:39%
[Michael] The first one,
he just wants it to roll.

00:09:46.718 --> 00:09:48.354
-He doesn't even want
to have to carry it.
-[Cecile] In the water.

00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:52.057
This is rolling, so, they
do some of those behaviors.

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:53.792 align:start size:97% position:3%
And now he's washing
it in the water,

00:09:53.825 --> 00:09:55.227 align:start size:97% position:3%
-[Cecile] Yeah.
-[Michael] Is it clean enough?

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.796 align:start position:0%
Oh, still gotta roll.

00:09:57.829 --> 00:10:00.799 align:start position:0%
That was incredible,
because the peanuts that
were just on the wood chip,

00:10:00.832 --> 00:10:03.235 size:78% position:39%
those went straight
into monkey mouths.

00:10:03.268 --> 00:10:05.237
<i> Was this an aberration?</i>

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.406 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> Andrew reloaded the peanut
 baits to find out.</i>

00:10:07.439 --> 00:10:09.208 align:start position:0%
-[Michael] Decoy.
-[Cecile] A female is
approaching.

00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:11.076
[Michael] Yep, here she is.

00:10:11.109 --> 00:10:13.646 size:78% position:39%
She smells it first,
and then-- and then--

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:16.048 align:start position:0%
-[Cecile] Smells it again.
-[Michael] Believes it, eats it.

00:10:16.081 --> 00:10:19.418 align:start size:84% position:16%
-[Cecile] On the fake.
-[Michael] That was
on the fake, yeah.

00:10:19.451 --> 00:10:21.153 align:start size:94% position:6%
Very cool.

00:10:21.186 --> 00:10:23.722 align:start position:0%
Now she already ate off
the decoy and it was safe.

00:10:23.755 --> 00:10:27.860 align:start position:0%
She hasn't, oh she put
the control right in her mouth.

00:10:27.893 --> 00:10:30.029 align:start size:91% position:9%
-[Cecile] Yes.
-[Michael] And she's going
to wash the real feces.

00:10:30.062 --> 00:10:31.430
[Cecile] Yeah.

00:10:31.463 --> 00:10:34.099 align:start size:81% position:19%
And she went for
the real feces last.

00:10:34.132 --> 00:10:35.801 align:start size:91% position:9%
Yes, she did.

00:10:35.834 --> 00:10:37.069 align:start size:97% position:3%
[Michael] She's got
a baby with her,

00:10:37.102 --> 00:10:39.672 align:start position:0%
so I really hope
she cleans that.

00:10:39.705 --> 00:10:41.707 align:start size:78% position:22%
[Cecile] Or maybe that's
the disadvantage,

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.244 align:start size:75% position:25%
she's carrying a baby,
she cannot afford, like,
cleaning everything.

00:10:45.277 --> 00:10:47.413 align:start size:81% position:19%
Yeah.

00:10:47.446 --> 00:10:53.018 align:start position:0%
I'm really
amused by how they
visually recognize feces.

00:10:53.051 --> 00:10:55.454 align:start size:88% position:13%
-I mean we're far away,
it's hard for me to tell,
-Yes.

00:10:55.487 --> 00:11:00.292 align:start position:0%
but they can see that shape
or texture--

00:11:00.325 --> 00:11:02.127 align:start size:66% position:34%
-"Be wary."
-Yeah.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.897
<i> Over the course of several
 rounds of the experiment,</i>

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.166 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> the monkeys would eat off
 of the control,</i>

00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:10.903
<i> wash food from the replica,
 and be extremely hesitant</i>

00:11:10.936 --> 00:11:13.272
<i> towards anything
 that touched poop.</i>

00:11:13.305 --> 00:11:17.876 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> The macaques demonstrated
 a clear and strong
 sense of disgust</i>

00:11:17.909 --> 00:11:23.382 align:start position:0%
<i>that was driving their decision
making and potentially keeping
them safe from pathogens.</i>

00:11:23.415 --> 00:11:27.186
<i> With the experiment complete,
 Dr. McIntosh returned topside</i>

00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:29.455 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> so we could discuss
 our findings.</i>

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:32.024 align:start size:84% position:16%
So did you enjoy
the view from up here?

00:11:32.057 --> 00:11:35.227 align:start size:88% position:13%
[Michael]
They did exactly what we
talked about earlier.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:39.798
Ready to avoid, parasite
infested potential things.

00:11:39.831 --> 00:11:43.869 align:start size:88% position:13%
Yeah, I mean it's
pretty clear, there's not
a complete hesitation

00:11:43.902 --> 00:11:46.171
to pick up things
on actual feces

00:11:46.204 --> 00:11:49.074 align:start position:0%
but the reactions that
the monkeys give when they do so

00:11:49.107 --> 00:11:53.345 align:start size:94% position:6%
is just so clearly different
than when they are picking
things off the ground

00:11:53.378 --> 00:11:55.347 align:start size:88% position:13%
or off the control items
that they have here.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:00.753
Yeah, yeah, in fact,
I, you know, I only saw
a few trials here,

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:05.491 align:start size:88% position:13%
but as soon as the peanut
or the monkey chow on
the feces is picked up

00:12:05.524 --> 00:12:08.427 align:start size:91% position:9%
and they realize that
the feces is coming with it

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:13.398
it's a sticky substance
and that was when their
revulsion got larger.

00:12:13.431 --> 00:12:17.102 align:start size:97% position:3%
It almost seemed like they
might be absent-mindedly going
"I don't care,"

00:12:17.135 --> 00:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
-and something deeper in them
was like, "you should care, you
should throw this,"
-<i> Yeah.</i>

00:12:20.272 --> 00:12:26.044 align:start size:91% position:9%
roll it, wash it,
so it makes sense from
an evolutionary standpoint.

00:12:26.077 --> 00:12:29.882 align:start size:91% position:9%
Well, Cecile, Andrew,
thank you again so much for
letting me come out here

00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:32.551 align:start size:81% position:19%
to see a primate
experiment in action.

00:12:32.584 --> 00:12:34.953 align:start size:91% position:9%
This was really phenomenal.
Thank you.

00:12:34.986 --> 00:12:37.389 align:start size:84% position:16%
-[both] You're welcome.
-Thanks for coming.
