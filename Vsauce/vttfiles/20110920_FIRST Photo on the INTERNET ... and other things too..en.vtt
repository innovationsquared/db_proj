Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And this week I am

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:07.730
in San Francisco. I just flew in a couple
of days ago, so I've been busy traveling,

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.230
but new episodes of
regular shows like IMG! and DONG are

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.090
coming soon. But in the meantime rather than
post nothing I figured I would share

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.990
things that have been on my mind.
For instance, go back to the Golden Gate

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.500
Bridge

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.070
footage. There. Her. 
That's the girl I sat next to on the flight.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.140
Turns out she's an immunology researcher
at a university in Italy.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.099
She's studying these parasitic worms in
Africa that that infect people,

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.620
but then leave those people immune
to things like diabetes

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.460
and allergies. In fact, if you cure these
people of the worm infection

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.129
they once again become susceptible to
things like diabetes and allergies.

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.000
It's really incredible, so, I guess,
good luck girl on the plane to solving that

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.100
because it sounds

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.309
awesome. On the flight I also did a bunch
of reading. I read this entire book.

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.250
The history of Britain in really tiny
little bite-sized chunks.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.750
Now, the thing that really blew my mind
was about Ireland

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.690
and the potato famine in the 1840s.
So many people

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.979
died or left the country because at
that famine

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.100
that to this day the population of Ireland is still

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.659
lower than it was a hundred and fifty
years ago

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.799
before the famine.
Speaking of things like people and birth rates,

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.180
Breathingearth[.net] is an amazing website.
You can just sit there

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.790
and let the site visually show you,
based on recent statistics, where people are

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.670
being born

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.310
and dying and how frequently.
A blue Sun represents a birth

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.690
and a black dot represents a death.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.530
This is a picture of Anne Hathaway.
So is

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.900
this.
Except this Anne Hathaway is much, much older

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.460
and she's also quite famous.
This Anne Hathaway was the wife

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.930
of William Shakespeare.
Now, we don't have a photograph of her because

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.630
photography as we know it today wasn't even
invented until two hundred years after

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.159
that Anne Hathaway died.
This is the first

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.939
permanent photograph ever taken by
mankind. It's a view from a window in

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.960
France taken in

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.140
1836.
Two years later,

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.550
in 1838, this photograph was taken.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.790
And what's significant about it is that
it's the first photograph

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.670
ever taken that had people people in it.
If you look down here, for instance, you can see a man

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.599
at a water pump.

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.779
Modern colorization of the image have
also claimed to have discovered

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.040
other people in the picture.
Now, none of them are very clear,

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.450
which is why we should talk about Robert Cornelius.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.510
I actually hid this portrait in the
beginning of

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.800
the most recent IMG!
And the reason it's significant is that this

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.140
picture is the first portrait ever taken.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.810
It's the first capturing of light
reflected off a human's face.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.290
Think of it this way: there is no other photograph

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.500
of anybody older than this.
This is the oldest human

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.620
we have a photographic record of.
Finally,

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.860
here's a picture that IMG!
would be proud of. A photo

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.280
of a musical parody group
called "The Horrible CERN Girls,"

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.010
formed out of employees at CERN.
The initials of their name in French are C, E,

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.170
R, N.
But why should we care about this picture?

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.849
Well, in 1992, Tim Berners-Lee

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.340
uploaded this photo to a website, making

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.460
this image the very first photographic image

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.500
ever on the Internet.
But here

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.760
is something that has never happened.
Along the border of

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.700
China and Bhutan is a mountain called
Gangkhar Puensum.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.120
At 24,800 feet high it is the
tallest mountain in the world

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.459
that mankind has yet to reach the top of.

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.650
The local government prohibits not
nearing in the region, which means it

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.150
might be left unconquered for quite some
time, making it one of just

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.860
many things on Earth
that we have yet to explore.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.840
In a couple of days we'll have a new episode of
DONG, so be sure to subscribe to Vsauce.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.660
And as always,

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.180
thanks for watching.
