[Michael]<i> I had the chance
 to sit down</i>

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:10.176
<i> with journalist
 and author Ben Blum,</i>

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:11.744
<i> who is one of the Stanford
 Prison Experiment's</i>

00:00:11.777 --> 00:00:13.646
<i> most outspoken critics.</i>

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:14.547
<i> During our discussion,</i>

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.449
<i> he told me about his cousin
 Alex,</i>

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:18.684
<i> who was arrested for
participating in a bank robbery</i>

00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:20.486
<i> with his fellow Army Rangers,</i>

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.489
<i>and received a lenient sentence
 thanks to the testimony</i>

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:24.824
<i> of Dr. Zimbardo.</i>

00:00:24.857 --> 00:00:29.062
Alex isn't here today,
but how does he feel now

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:33.833
about the lenient sentence he
received because of Zimbardo?

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:37.603 line:0%
Alex feels very conflicted.

00:00:37.636 --> 00:00:40.273 align:start position:0%
He felt for years
that it was unjust

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:42.141
for him to have served
any time at all.

00:00:42.174 --> 00:00:45.144
He really felt innocent.

00:00:45.177 --> 00:00:47.113 size:50% position:25%
He was so bitter
for so long.

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:51.551
He felt that he'd had no choice
but to go along.

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:54.153 size:75% position:38%
I mean, being the victim
of circumstance

00:00:54.186 --> 00:00:58.291 size:88% position:44%
is an incredibly frightening
and powerless thing to be.

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:01.494
I think there's this kind
of shallow comfort

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:04.130
that the Zimbardo narrative
appears to give us.

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:05.832
None of us are really
responsible

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:07.667
for the things we do wrong.
We can't help ourselves.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.135
We're just caught up
in situations.

00:01:09.168 --> 00:01:10.536
But to accept that

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:12.638
it to say that
you're agentless.

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:16.609
Yeah. How am I ever going to
avoid doing something horrible?

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:19.245
For a lot of years,
he had a hard time accepting

00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:21.481
responsibility for involvement
in the crime.

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:26.853
And now I think he accepts that
he really was guilty of a crime.

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:31.657
and that he deserved
to go to jail for it.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.095
So it sounds like taking
personal responsibility...

00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:38.764
admitting more control

00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:42.168
helped Alex come to better terms
with what happened,

00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:46.272
and doesn't just feel like
the victim of a circumstance.

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:49.208 size:66% position:67%
So how does Alex feel
about it today?

00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:52.145
Alex has undergone
a pretty dramatic

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:53.479 size:75% position:38%
personal transformation.

00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:55.381 size:59% position:30%
Acknowledging that,
actually,

00:01:55.414 --> 00:01:57.150
there was a voice inside him

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:58.484
that did register
what was going on.

00:01:58.517 --> 00:02:02.755
There was a conscience at work

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:05.558 align:start position:0%
that he acted against.

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:08.661 size:63% position:31%
Restored his faith
in his own humanity.

00:02:08.694 --> 00:02:10.930 size:69% position:34%
And that was immensely
liberating.

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:14.300
He and one of the tellers

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:16.836 size:63% position:31%
in the bank that day
have corresponded.

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:22.308
She said that she doesn't harbor
any ill will toward him anymore.

00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:23.877 size:63% position:31%
And that's been
really good for him.
