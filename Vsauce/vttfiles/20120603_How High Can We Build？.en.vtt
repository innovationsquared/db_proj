00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:08.500
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And when the pyramids
of Giza were built, the tallest was 147 meters

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:16.440
tall, making them the tallest things humans
had ever built. And they remained that way

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:24.420
for nearly 4,000 years. It wasn't even until
the 1300's that we finally got around to making

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.130
something taller, a cathedral in England.
So, does that mean that the Great Pyramids

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.910
of Giza are the "Best tallest structures of all time?"

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.840
Well, to find out more, all aboard the BOAT.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.440
So, what is a building? Well, technically,
a building is a structure in which at least

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:52.080
50% of its height comes from floor plates
where people can live, work, chill out, it

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.239
has to be habitable. Any less than that and
it's not a building, it's a tower. After the

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.679
Lincoln Cathedral finally surpassed the height
of the pyramids, a number of churches continued

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.780
to be built that kept breaking and setting
new records. The next long-term record holder

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.190
was the Eiffel Tower.
It was the tallest thing, ever in history,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.470
that we had built, for about 40 years in a
row. It was finally surpassed by the Chrysler

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.580
Building in New York, a personal favorite,
which was then quickly bested by the Empire

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.909
State Building. Now, the Empire State Building
is interesting in that it was the first structure

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.380
ever built by man that was so tall, were you
to jump off the top of it, you would actually

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.009
reach terminal velocity before you hit the
bottom. It was the first structure we'd ever

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.060
built that was so tall, rather than just continuing
to accelerate as you fell, you would actually

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.130
stop accelerating because you would reach
the fastest possible speed your limp body

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.250
can fall at. In the mid 1950's, something
weird started to happen. Humans started to

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.840
build radio and TV towers. These things could
be way taller than the buildings that we'd

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.810
made previously that had to be habitable.
And so, ever since the Empire State Building

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.530
had its record broken by a TV tower, all these
other famously tall buildings, the Petronas

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.480
Towers, Tapei 101, the World Trade Center,
the Willis Tower - formerly Sears Tower - none

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.060
of them have ever, within their existence,
actually held the title for being the tallest

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:41.640
"thing" we've ever built. There was always
a radio or TV tower somewhere that was taller.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.580
Up until quite recently, and for quite a while,
the record for the tallest thing ever built

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.560
by humans went to the Warsaw radio mast in
Poland. It's visually incredibly striking,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.920
because there aren't any other sky scrapers
around it. It's all alone, being very tall.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.680
Well, that was until 1991, where some workers
exchanging guy-wires made a mistake and the

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.599
whole thing started to bend and then snapped
in the middle. There's no video of the event

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:18.599
happening, but it would have been similar
to this collapse, though much, much taller.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.700
After the Warsaw radio mast collapsed, the
KVLY-TV mast in North Dakota became the tallest,

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:33.290
still standing, structure built by man. But
recently, buildings have made a comeback.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.599
And to check that out, we're going to have
to travel to the Middle East. This is the

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:49.319
first time I've ever touched the Nile. 
Tadaaa. Ok, so that was me dipping my

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.629
waterproof camera into the Nile. If you were to take

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:59.150
the entire length of the Nile River and stand
it up on its edge, perpendicular to the Earth,

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.860
it would reach into outer space about this
far, which is pretty impressive. But where

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.980
does the space shuttle orbit? And where does
the International Space Station orbit? This

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:19.720
far away? This far away? Maybe this far away?
Actually, if this pink, inflatable "Horrible

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:28.440
Bosses" ball was the Earth, the space shuttle
would orbit about right there. It's incredible,

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.139
but it's possible because the shuttle, and
the International Space Station, travel so

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:38.189
quickly. They travel so quickly around the
Earth that instead of seeing one sunrise

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:46.529
and sunset every 24 hours, they see 16.
But don't be jealous. You can easily see more

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:54.059
than one sunrise and/or sunset in a day by
taking advantage of tall structures. So, let's

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:58.680
take a look at the tallest structure, the
current record holder for the tallest thing

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.960
humans have ever built, the Burj Khalifa in
Dubai. The height of this building blows my

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.509
mind. You can literally watch the sunset from
the base of the building, and then take a

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:18.469
super-fast elevator all-the-way up to the
top and watch the same sun set again. In fact,

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:21.129
the difference
in timing between sunset at the base and the

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:27.270
top is so significant, the Dubai Islamic Affairs
department actually had to make a ruling about

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:33.139
when you can start, and break, your fast during
Ramadan inside the building. People above

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:39.979
floor 80 or higher have to actually wait to
start eating 2-3 minutes after the people

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:45.349
at the base, because the sun hasn't yet set
for those at the top. But before you head

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:50.789
to Dubai to watch the sun rise or set twice
in a day, keep in mind that the only height

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:57.679
you actually need to see two sunrises or sunsets
is the height of your own body. Try this the

00:05:57.679 --> 00:06:01.939
next time you're at a beach.
Watch the sun rise or set over

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:06.629
the water. Water is important because it won't
have the terrain and hill issues that land

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:13.229
does. Now let's say you're watching a sunset.
Begin by laying on your stomach. Watch the

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:18.520
sun set and as soon as the very last little bit
of the sun goes below the horizon, quickly pop

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:24.349
up into a standing position and voilÃ¡,
you'll see the sun's back - part of it's back -

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:27.029
and it will set another time.

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:31.900
If you take a stopwatch and record the time
between the first setting and the second setting

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:36.839
that you witness and measure the height
of your eyes when you're laying down and when

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:42.300
you're standing, you can use those numbers
to calculate the radius of the Earth.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:49.679
XKCD took this a little bit further by proposing
the "Double Sunset Date." Take your date out

00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:54.409
to the beach in a cherry picker and sure
enough, it was calculated, given the speed

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:59.389
of a cherry picker, all you have to do is move
about 6 feet up and you can watch a beautiful

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:01.769
sunset all over again.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.400
To put things in perspective, the Burj Khalifa
is nowhere near as tall as Mount Everest.

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:14.399
But the tallest structure that we could potentially
build wouldn't be as tall as Mount Everest,

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:21.080
it would be way, way taller. Like, into space
taller. Of course, the problem with building

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.349
things that are really tall is that they get
heavier and heavier and have to support their

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:28.349
own weight. But only up to a point.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:35.180
If a structure was so tall that it wound up
at the altitude of a geostationary orbit,

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:39.849
it would start to feel a new force, not just
a gravitational force downward, but all of

00:07:39.849 --> 00:07:45.219
the sudden this new, centrifugal force up and outward.

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:53.459
And so, a building that tall could be stable
through tension. And more than 35,000 km

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:59.839
high.
This kind if structure is known as a "Space Elevator."

00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:04.360
Unfortunately, there aren't any materials
known to science today that are strong enough

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:10.459
to make building something that large feasable.
With the exception, maybe, of Carbon Nanotubes,

00:08:10.459 --> 00:08:15.759
or Boron-Nitrate Nanotubes. Of course, if
we went to a smaller celestial body, like

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.360
the Moon, we could build one today out of
stuff like Kevlar.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.460
There are a lot of different things that we
have to be wary of when we build a space elevator.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:30.200
For instance, how do we dodge space debris?
One solution is to attach the Earth side of

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:35.899
the cable to a boat in the ocean that can
maneuver around and move the elevator away

00:08:35.899 --> 00:08:37.459
from dangerous obstacles.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:43.480
Another interesting point is that the taller
the cable, the faster the far end of it will

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:50.519
be traveling. In fact, if the cable is more
than 50,000 km long, its far end will be travelling

00:08:50.519 --> 00:08:57.699
near escape velocity and simply walking outside
could take you to the Moon. But why build

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:03.640
a space elevator? Well, because it would be
awesome. But also for better reasons too.

00:09:03.649 --> 00:09:09.370
For instance, right now, in order to send
a pound of material into orbit, it costs about

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:15.370
11,000 dollars. But with a space elevator,
we could send the same amount of material

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:22.370
into orbit for only about 100 bucks. That
difference is so significant that Philip Ragan

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:29.500
has said that the first country to deploy
a space elevator will have a 95% cost advantage

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:37.980
and will possibly be able to control all space
related activities. Alright, so here you see,

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:42.560
in the mirror, Alex
playing guitar while she holds a camera in

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.980
her mouth and records us. Impressive. I'm
here with Kristen from Barely Political. She's

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.839
visiting London and if you enjoyed this episode
