00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.430
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And today we are going to talk about time, specifically, how

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:13.430
much time we have. What's the oldest a person
can ever be? Well, the world record for the

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:20.560
world's longest living person belongs to Jeanne
Calment, a French woman who lived to be 122.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.970
Right now, at this very moment, there are
only 37 people alive who were born in the

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.120
1800's. Those 37 people have lived in three
different centuries. But, as medical knowledge

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.620
expands and our understanding of biology improves,
people are living longer, and longer. In fact,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.680
scientists believe that, based on statistics,
the first person who will ever live to be

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.690
150 has already been born. It could be one
of you. But, according to the math, it's probably

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.170
someone who was born last year.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.170
Here's the thing. As humans get older, the
likelihood of them dying increases, but there

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.820
are some types of animals that have what is
called Negligible Senescence, also known as

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.970
biological immortality, and these types of
animals have never been observed to actually

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.760
age. Animals, like the Hydra, can only die
because of accidents, disease, or predators.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.610
The world's oldest living individual tree
has clocked in at more than 4,600 years old.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.440
It's called the Methuselah Tree and it exists
somewhere in this forest. Government officials

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.710
won't actually release its exact location
to protect it from vandalism, but it's out

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.900
there.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.160
The lifespan of an organism can be even longer
than that if you include clonal colonies.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.020
For instance, these Quaking Pines all look
like individual trees, but they're actually

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.640
all clones of one genetic code. They all share
a root system, and the root system continues

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.170
to make more trees, meaning that these trees
are all part of the same organism, and experts

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.220
have calculated, based on the roots system,
that this one, male Quaking Pine has been

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.170
around for at least 80,000 years.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.410
But let's get back to humans, and rather
than talking about how time is, let's talk about

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.140
how time feels. Intense moments of your life
are remembered as lasting much longer than

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.600
times that were relatively dull. Psychologists
say that the reason for this is that our brains

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.440
take deeper and richer memories of events
that are novel, or events that are intense,

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.720
than ones that aren't.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.160
When your experiences are intense and novel,
you're not remembering more things about it,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.860
but you are making more copies. Rather than
just making normal memories, during stress

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.330
the amygdala gets involved and also remembers
things, and many people believe that is why

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.970
intense moments are remembered as lasting longer.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.610
This phenomenon becomes quite mind-blowing
on a macro-scale. Think of it this way: when

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:05.420
you are a one-year-old baby, one year represents
100 percent of your life, but when your turn

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.540
two years old, that second year was only half
your life, and the next year you live through

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.180
is only a third of your life, and by the time
you turn 80, one year only represents an 80th

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.360
of your life. Those percentages are important
because they may explain why your childhood

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.000
feels like it took so long, but as you get
older, the years seem to fly by.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
You have more novel experiences when you're
young. You first learn a language, you first

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.740
see your mother, you first learn to walk,
you have your first kiss. These are all deeply

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:43.060
and richly remembered by your brain, and so,
later on, it feels as if they took longer

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.989
to happen.

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.910
Now, here's what's really mind-blowing. Let's
look at a graphical representation of the

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.970
percentage of your life that each successive
year is. The first year is 100 percent, the

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.000
second year is only half, the third year is
a third, and so-on will go all-the-way out to

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.300
80. Now, using this representation, under
this model, when you turn 80 years old and

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.540
look back at your life, the point that feels
like the middle isn't your 40's, it's your

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.740
early 20's.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.920
The good news here is that the more novel things
you do, and things you see, and places you

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.560
visit, and people you meet, the slower time
feels, and the more rich it feels. So, go

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.520
out there and do something cool, do something
weird, do something new. Subscribe to Vsauce

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.680
if you haven't already!

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.920
And as always,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.500
thanks for watching.
