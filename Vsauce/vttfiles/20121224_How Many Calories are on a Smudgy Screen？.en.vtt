00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.440
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And I'm home for the holidays.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.150
I'm in my parents' basement,
using a different camera than usual.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.129
But you know what is always different?
Fingerprints.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.610
The palms of our hands and the soles of our
feet are weird.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.400
They are covered with friction ridges, which
act like the design of a stamp that stamps

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.530
everything you touch.
Plastic or patent prints are visible to the

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.540
naked eye.
But even with seemingly clean hands on a seemingly

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.540
clean surface, a fingerprint can be left.
A latent fingerprint.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.480
But what are those made of?
Well, by the square millimetre, they're made

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.100
out of this.
All of this stuff is natural.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.130
In fact, a lot of it is produced to keep your
skin healthy, waterproof, pliable.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.960
But touch a surface enough and the gunk can build up.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.110
It's what causes smudges on computer screens
and mobile devices.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:13.470
Now, given that protein contains 4 calories
per gram, fat contains 9 calories per gram

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.960
and the surface area of the iPhone 5 is 4,400
square millimetres, completely licking clean

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.270
a smudgy iPhone 5 screen is gonna give you
about 2 calories.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.270
If you were to lick clean 245 smudgy iPhones 5, well, that would be the same as eating

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.650
a Big Mac.
But before you run off and get all of your

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.540
nutrition from smudgy phones, you should know that
us humans need a bit more variety than that.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.299
I've always found it interesting that cats
and dogs can grow up and live great lives

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.920
eating the exact same food everyday.
Well, what about us humans?

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.619
What can we eat everyday without ever changing
it up and be fine?

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.189
It turns out that there is one type of food
that you could eat everyday for the rest of

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.270
your life and be fine,
without ever having something different.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.170
If you follow @tweetsauce,
you already know what it is.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.840
The answer is human breast milk.
Whether your ridges loop or arch or whorl

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.989
is largely genetic.
But the tiny minutiae of your prints formed

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:31.480
while you were developing inside your mother.
It tells a story about the very specific conditions

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.980
around the dividing cells that became your skin.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.940
And for that reason, even identical twins,
who pretty much share the exact same DNA,

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.870
wind up with different fingerprints.
I could clone you 100 times and every one

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.739
of those clones would have a unique set of fingerprints.

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.709
Your skin has two major layers.
The epidermis on the outside and the dermis,

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.310
which is below.
The basal layer of your epidermis creates

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.990
new skin cells, which migrate up towards the
outside world, where they die and flatten

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.260
out, forming the protective outermost part
of your skin - the 'horny layer' - which means

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:23.000
that all day, everyday, you are covered with
and showing off to the entire world your horny

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.459
layer.
These outer cells are constantly shed away,

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.459
but their arrangement stays the same, because
their shape is determined by the shape of

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:40.080
the basal layer down below.
This is why you can superficially and temporarily

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.510
sandpaper or cut off your fingerprints, but
they'll still grow back the way they were

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.610
before.
But why do we have fingerprints in the first

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.659
place?
I mean, not all mammals have friction ridges.

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:58.930
Is this some sort of cruel joke the universe
made to make it more difficult for us humans

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.349
to get away with crimes?
Probably not.

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.599
The most likely answer is two-fold.
First of all, it has been show that friction

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:14.319
ridges allow us to sense subtle textures 100
times better than if we didn't have them.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.509
And because fingerprints loop and arch and
swirl in different directions, all it takes

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:24.109
is one simple touch for us to detect a subtle
texture moving in any direction.

00:04:24.109 --> 00:04:29.280
It's also been shown that having friction
ridges allows mammals, like us, primates,

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.529
koalas, the North American fisher, to better
climb and grasp wet stuff.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.200
Even though no two fingerprints are exactly
the same, the methods we have for matching

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.610
fingerprints aren't always perfect.
There are plenty of different ways to model

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.699
fingerprints and each one is calculated at
different probability of a false match.

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:55.960
But if you wanna commit a crime, it's best
to just avoid fingerprints altogether.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:03.660
How about hiring someone with adermatoglyphia?
A few skin conditions can cause the disappearance

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.520
of fingerprints.
But adermatoglyphia is a genetic one that

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.280
has no other side effects.
But it's rare.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.360
Only four extended families on Earth are known
to have the condition.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.899
But if you wanna avoid leaving fingerprints
and can't find somebody with adermatoglyphia,

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:28.159
don't worry, just find someone who hasn't
gone through puberty yet.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:36.080
Sure, kids might snot and slob all over stuff,
but they carry far less heavy waxy oil on

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.479
their skin.
And for this reason, the fingerprints of a

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:45.519
child will disappear, evaporate, much more
quickly than those of an adult.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.360
A child's fingerprints can evaporate in only a few hours.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.520
So, use kids to commit your crimes.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.220
And as always,

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.480
thanks for watching.
