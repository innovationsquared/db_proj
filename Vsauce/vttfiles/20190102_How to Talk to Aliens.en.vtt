Where is everyone?

00:00:07.473 --> 00:00:10.643
We have been listening
for messages from outer space

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:13.579
for more than half a century,

00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:15.482
and so far...

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:19.552
silence.

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:21.087
Why?

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.158
Are we truly alone
in the universe?

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:28.194
Or is everyone else
acting like us

00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:31.097
and just doing a lot
of listening?

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.199
Maybe we need to be louder.

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:36.736
Maybe we need to send
more messages out there.

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.672
But how do you write a letter
to an extraterrestrial

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:42.742
whose language and culture
and biology and mind

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:44.811
we have no concept of?

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:46.512
And what do you say?

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:50.750
And given all of the unknowns
about what they might be,

00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:53.686
should we say
anything at all?

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.491
<i> ♪♪</i>

00:01:14.206 --> 00:01:15.641
Ever since I was a kid,

00:01:15.674 --> 00:01:18.244
I've wanted to design
a message

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:20.379
that is sent
to outer space.

00:01:20.412 --> 00:01:23.516
A sort of hello from Earth
to whatever extraterrestrials

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.251
might be out there.

00:01:25.284 --> 00:01:28.654
I mean, come on, to be
the author of the first thing

00:01:28.687 --> 00:01:31.290
aliens ever heard
from our entire planet

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:33.626
would be a fantastic honor.

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.861
And as it turns out,

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:37.697
an opportunity to send
a message to space

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.533
has been given to me.

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:43.169
But it might
be a waste of time.

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:48.875
What if there isn't anything or
anyone out there to receive it?

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:51.144
The fact that we still have
no evidence

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:52.245
of intelligent alien life

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:56.282
despite the high probability
that such life exists,

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:58.184
is called the Fermi paradox.

00:01:58.217 --> 00:01:59.752
And there are many
entertaining theories

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:01.721
that attempt to explain it.

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:03.623
One explanation
is the theory

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:06.359
that whenever two
civilizations meet,

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:09.295
destruction always results.

00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:11.564
Which is why in 2015,

00:02:11.597 --> 00:02:13.766
several prominent experts
wrote a letter

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.803 line:0%
warning against making
any contact at all.

[Stephen Hawking]

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:39.559
Ideas like that suggest that
perhaps we should remain silent,

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:42.195
send no messages to space.

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:44.597
But Doug Vakoch
disagrees.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.866
He is the president of METI,

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:50.336
an organization that,
despite all of these concerns,

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:52.738
is nonetheless
actively messaging

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:55.474
extraterrestrial
intelligence.

00:02:55.507 --> 00:02:57.743
If I want to design a message
for life out there,

00:02:57.776 --> 00:02:59.679
I should talk to him first.

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:02.849

This was one of the prime
telescopes of a century ago.

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:22.368
This is really an antique.

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:25.404
[Michael] Jeez!
I've seen so many observatories

00:03:25.437 --> 00:03:27.673
and so many big telescopes
in pictures.

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:29.575
Believe it or not, I've never
been this close to one.

00:03:29.608 --> 00:03:31.877
[Douglas]
This is a huge instrument,

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.914
and yet it's balanced
too exquisitely.

00:03:34.947 --> 00:03:37.283
I'm like a super person.
Oh!

[Douglas laughs]

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:40.453
It had quite a bit
of momentum there.

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:41.654
I'm scared to look.

00:03:41.687 --> 00:03:44.423
I'm telling you, I had no idea
I would have this feeling,

00:03:44.456 --> 00:03:46.525
-seeing a telescope this big.
-[Douglas] Well, it is, it is.

00:03:46.558 --> 00:03:48.594
Can I handle
what I would see?

00:03:48.627 --> 00:03:49.929
I think you can.
I think you can.

00:03:49.962 --> 00:03:51.931 align:start position:0%

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:54.600

-Absolutely nothing.
-[Douglas] Not tonight.

00:03:56.368 --> 00:03:58.304
-Because of the fog.
-Because of the fog.

00:03:58.337 --> 00:04:01.941
[Michael]
Just the fog coming in
is pretty darn cool.

<i> we've also launched

<i> The records were recordings

<i>that told a story of who we are

<i> Today, Doug and his team

 new messages to the stars.</i>

00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:03.035
Thank you for taking some time
to have a conversation with me.

00:05:03.068 --> 00:05:06.339
My first question
is simply this:

00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:08.407
where is everyone?

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.942
Are we alone?

00:05:09.975 --> 00:05:11.510
I don't think so.

00:05:11.543 --> 00:05:12.645
You know, we've been looking

00:05:12.678 --> 00:05:13.779
for over 60 years.

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:16.482
And so that leads some people
to say we must be alone.

00:05:16.515 --> 00:05:17.850
The reality is, though,

00:05:17.883 --> 00:05:19.752
we have just
begun the search.

00:05:19.785 --> 00:05:23.689
I mean, we've looked at a few
tens of thousands of stars,

00:05:23.722 --> 00:05:28.027
and there are 400 billion stars
in our galaxy alone.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.496
Billions of galaxies
in the universe.

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:32.898
So I think we just need
to keep on looking.

00:05:32.931 --> 00:05:33.832
When you put it that way,

00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:35.100
it actually isn't
that surprising, is it?

00:05:35.133 --> 00:05:40.039
I mean, we are still discovering
species on our own planet today.

00:05:40.072 --> 00:05:42.708
At METI, we switch the process,

00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:44.910
and instead of just listening
for signals,

00:05:44.943 --> 00:05:48.447
we send powerful, intentional
signals to other stars

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.416
in the hope of getting
a reply.

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:53.018
What do you say
to people who go, "Hold on,

00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:56.856
"we should not be alerting any
life out there to our presence.

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.424
"It's just not worth the risk.

00:05:58.457 --> 00:06:00.126
In fact, it's irresponsible."

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:02.895
I would say it is too late.

00:06:02.928 --> 00:06:04.597
The horse is out of the barn.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.134
We have been announcing
our presence to the universe

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:12.605
since the beginning of radio
and television.

00:06:12.638 --> 00:06:14.573
Any civilization
that has the ability

00:06:14.606 --> 00:06:16.442
to travel between the stars

00:06:16.475 --> 00:06:18.511
already picked up
<i> I Love Lucy.</i>

00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:21.113
So maybe the aliens
have been observing us,

00:06:21.146 --> 00:06:24.550
but they're waiting for us
to break the silence.

00:06:24.583 --> 00:06:26.585
So our goal isn't
to let them know

00:06:26.618 --> 00:06:27.987
we're here for the first time.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.922
It's to really give
an indication

00:06:29.955 --> 00:06:31.690
that we want
to make contact.

00:06:31.723 --> 00:06:34.693
The one thing that's keeping me
from being really excited

00:06:34.726 --> 00:06:36.529
and comfortable
about sending a message out

00:06:36.562 --> 00:06:39.698
is that a lot of prominent
people have said, "Don't."

00:06:39.731 --> 00:06:41.967
There are some group
of scientists who have said

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.569
you shouldn't be doing this.

00:06:43.602 --> 00:06:44.637
Stephen Hawking.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.906
But that's an example
of someone very prominent

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:49.608
who said you shouldn't transmit,

00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:51.911
because maybe the aliens
will come to Earth.

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:53.712
To me it's notable that,
after his death,

00:06:53.745 --> 00:06:56.048
to commemorate his life,
his family,

00:06:56.081 --> 00:06:58.584
they transmitted his voice
out into space.

00:06:58.617 --> 00:07:02.488
Anyone and everyone can
transmit to extraterrestrials.

00:07:02.521 --> 00:07:04.790
So I think it's an incredible
contradiction

00:07:04.823 --> 00:07:07.560
for people involved in SETI
to say we shouldn't transmit,

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:11.030
because the day they succeed,
everyone will be transmitting.

00:07:11.063 --> 00:07:16.202
Okay, so how do we craft
a message for E.T.?

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:18.504
Well, it depends
what we would want to do.

00:07:18.537 --> 00:07:21.707
I would want to know something
about that civilization.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.876
And so then we try
to figure out,

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:26.679
what is it that we have
in common

00:07:26.712 --> 00:07:28.080
with the extraterrestrials?

00:07:28.113 --> 00:07:31.951
What do you think the aliens
would know that we know?

00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:33.486
I always go to math.

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:35.754
So that's the natural
starting place.

00:07:35.787 --> 00:07:39.091
But how can you communicate
the idea of numbers?

00:07:39.124 --> 00:07:40.693 align:start size:31% position:69%
Like this.

00:07:47.833 --> 00:07:49.835
[both clap]

00:07:49.868 --> 00:07:52.171
-Hey, look, we're communicating.
-Okay, okay, great, great.

00:07:52.204 --> 00:07:54.139
You could keep that up.
You could use that

00:07:54.172 --> 00:07:56.141
to count up to a million.

00:07:56.174 --> 00:07:59.245
But that doesn't capture
what it is to be human.

00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:00.313
Right.

00:08:00.346 --> 00:08:03.249
So you want to tell
a little bit about yourself.

00:08:03.282 --> 00:08:07.786
The goal, for me, is to learn
about other civilizations

00:08:07.819 --> 00:08:09.922 size:56% position:28%
if, in fact,
they're out there.

00:08:09.955 --> 00:08:11.790 size:63% position:31%
But I think
even if they're not,

00:08:11.823 --> 00:08:14.293
simply this process
of reflecting on what stories

00:08:14.326 --> 00:08:16.662
do we want to tell
about ourselves,

00:08:16.695 --> 00:08:19.598
how do we want to represent
ourselves to the universe,

00:08:19.631 --> 00:08:21.233
forces us to look
at ourselves anew.

00:08:21.266 --> 00:08:23.135
And I think that
can only be good.

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:30.943
One of my favorite messages

00:08:30.976 --> 00:08:33.913
that humans have ever sent
for extraterrestrials

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:37.216
to some day receive
was written in 1974

00:08:37.249 --> 00:08:39.752
by Frank Drake
and Carl Sagan.

00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:44.557 line:0%
They sent the message to a star
cluster 25,000 light years away.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:50.062 line:0%
It contained 1,679
binary digits

00:08:50.095 --> 00:08:52.131
that, when decoded,

00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:53.899
created an image:

00:08:53.932 --> 00:08:57.136
the famous Arecibo message.

00:08:57.169 --> 00:09:00.739
This message is full of general
information about us.

00:09:00.772 --> 00:09:03.208
Up here in the white
are numbers.

00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:05.711
Now, since math is probably
pretty universal,

00:09:05.744 --> 00:09:07.079
I feel like it's fair to say

00:09:07.112 --> 00:09:09.214
that aliens will understand
that part.

00:09:09.247 --> 00:09:11.350
But what about some of these
other parts?

00:09:11.383 --> 00:09:14.019
This is a human figure,
but will aliens be able to tell

00:09:14.052 --> 00:09:15.187
that that is supposed to be

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.723
the shape of the thing
that made this?

00:09:17.756 --> 00:09:21.193
Could an alien figure out
what all these symbols mean?

00:09:21.226 --> 00:09:24.229
For that matter, could a human
even correctly figure out

00:09:24.262 --> 00:09:25.664
what they all mean?

00:09:25.697 --> 00:09:27.733
And I bet that if you were
to ask two people

00:09:27.766 --> 00:09:30.002
to guess what all this means,

00:09:30.035 --> 00:09:32.204
you would get
two different answers.

00:09:32.237 --> 00:09:34.707
I want to give some humans
a message,

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.276
and I want to see how quickly
they come up with meanings

00:09:37.309 --> 00:09:40.245
I didn't put in there,
or conflicting interpretations,

00:09:40.278 --> 00:09:41.479
because if that happens,

00:09:41.513 --> 00:09:45.117
well it could spell trouble
for our ability to say much more

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:50.256
than simple mathematical truths
to whatever might be out there.

00:09:51.289 --> 00:09:53.192
<i> To help me answer
 this question,</i>

00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:55.394
<i> I recruited Dr. Steve Vance.</i>

00:09:55.427 --> 00:09:57.796
<i> Dr. Vance leads
 a habitability team</i>

00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:59.932

00:09:59.965 --> 00:10:02.968 line:0%

00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:04.970 line:0%
<i> of life on other planets.</i>

00:10:05.003 --> 00:10:06.839
I don't think it's crazy

00:10:06.872 --> 00:10:10.376
that if the Arecibo message
is received,

00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:12.878
the alien civilization
that gets it

00:10:12.911 --> 00:10:15.814
will see all kinds
of meanings in it.

00:10:15.847 --> 00:10:17.116
They're going to see things
through the lens

00:10:17.149 --> 00:10:19.785
of how they experience
their world.

00:10:19.818 --> 00:10:22.021
And I think if we received
a message from outer space,

00:10:22.054 --> 00:10:23.922
we would think of the ones
we've sent out,

00:10:23.955 --> 00:10:25.424
and we would look
for these pieces in it.

00:10:25.457 --> 00:10:29.928
And maybe the message
contains none of those things.

00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:32.131
I'm really curious
about this hypothesis

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:35.067
that they will find meaning
where there isn't any.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.802 size:63% position:31%
There's only
one way to find out.

00:10:36.835 --> 00:10:39.639

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.189
<i> that it's binary.</i>

00:12:37.222 --> 00:12:40.092
<i> There are two different tones

00:12:40.125 --> 00:12:43.428
[man] Is there a difference
in time between any of these?

00:12:43.461 --> 00:12:45.564
[woman]
It doesn't look like it.
The rhythm doesn't vary.

00:12:45.597 --> 00:12:46.798
[man]
It doesn't vary?

00:12:46.832 --> 00:12:50.402
There's going to be a repeating
pattern in there, probably.

00:12:50.435 --> 00:12:51.636
It seems like
there's only two notes.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:56.408
Yeah, it doesn't seem to go
any higher or lower than that.

00:12:56.441 --> 00:12:58.210 size:81% position:41%
So there's only two tones.
We're thinking some kind

00:12:58.243 --> 00:12:59.812 size:56% position:28%
of binary message,
zeros and ones,

00:12:59.845 --> 00:13:02.080 size:66% position:33%
We should probably
start transcribing it

00:13:02.113 --> 00:13:03.048
<i> and look for repeating
 patterns.</i>

00:13:03.081 --> 00:13:04.416 size:56% position:72%
Right off the bat,
all right?

00:13:04.449 --> 00:13:07.019
They're noticing two tones,
binary message.

00:13:07.052 --> 00:13:08.987
I think that's a very
human thing to do,

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.290
because we already
come to this

00:13:11.323 --> 00:13:14.560
knowing that binary is this
great way to talk, right?

00:13:14.593 --> 00:13:18.530
So we're already seeing into it
what we expect to see.

00:13:18.563 --> 00:13:22.868
Okay, so, we have a way
to encode binary into letters.

00:13:22.901 --> 00:13:24.603
So if an alien intelligence
is sending things,

00:13:24.636 --> 00:13:25.804
we obviously wouldn't know that,

00:13:25.837 --> 00:13:28.106
-and it wouldn't be
the same language anyway.
-Right.

00:13:28.139 --> 00:13:30.275
So they're probably just sending
us straight numbers.

00:13:30.308 --> 00:13:33.212
Like, there's, you know,
universal language and all that.

00:13:33.245 --> 00:13:34.446
So we got to find out
what those numbers are.

00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:35.848
Okay, let's have
three people do this,

00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:37.583
just so we make sure
we don't miss anything.

00:13:37.616 --> 00:13:39.852
Let's do zero for low,
one for high,

00:13:39.885 --> 00:13:41.119
and let's start
writing it down.

00:13:41.152 --> 00:13:43.889
[woman]
Zero, one, zero, zero, zero...

00:13:43.922 --> 00:13:48.961
Now they are creating
a visual representation

00:13:48.994 --> 00:13:50.495
of these different tones.

00:13:50.528 --> 00:13:54.199
The key is to see how many tones
there are.

00:13:54.232 --> 00:13:56.335
-Zero, zero--
-Oh, wait, sorry. I got it.

00:13:56.368 --> 00:13:57.303
[pinging]

00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:58.771
[woman]
Do we need to play it in half
time

00:13:58.804 --> 00:14:01.006
-because I feel like
we're scrambling.
-Yeah, we're just scrambling.

00:14:01.039 --> 00:14:01.940

1,679 total.

00:14:43.315 --> 00:14:46.652

1,679. Is that divisible
by anything in particular?

00:14:46.685 --> 00:14:49.054
-It's a prime number.
-Could be a prime number.

00:14:49.087 --> 00:14:51.056
It's going to be hard to test
that without writing a script.

<i> from the message

00:15:13.044 --> 00:15:15.647
<i> the jumbled image

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.217
<i> If the group can discover
 this feature of 1,679,</i>

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.320
<i> they may be able to start

Ooh. Ooh!

00:15:24.756 --> 00:15:27.626
Hey, it's-- hey, yo,
this is important, guys.

00:15:27.659 --> 00:15:30.228
This number breaks down
to 23x73.

00:15:30.261 --> 00:15:31.330 align:start size:16% position:84%
Okay.

00:15:31.363 --> 00:15:33.465
Ah-ha. There it is.

00:15:33.498 --> 00:15:34.700
And that is
the only breakdown,

00:15:34.733 --> 00:15:37.002
because 23 and 73
are prime numbers.

00:15:37.035 --> 00:15:38.570
So that's its prime
factorization.

00:15:38.603 --> 00:15:41.473
So that is very relevant.

00:15:41.506 --> 00:15:45.143 size:81% position:59%

00:15:45.176 --> 00:15:46.277
[man]
<i> Do you think it's worth it</i>

00:15:46.311 --> 00:15:51.450
to try and straight up, like,
make a 23-by-73 grid,

00:15:51.483 --> 00:15:53.719
and then you could
say that the lows are white

00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:54.887
and the ones are black,

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.556
and maybe there's some kind
of image being sent there.

00:15:57.589 --> 00:15:58.724 align:start size:53% position:47%
I like that idea.

00:15:58.757 --> 00:15:59.792

[man]<i> I'm strongly
 with the graph idea.</i>

00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:03.996
[woman]

00:16:04.029 --> 00:16:06.598

00:16:37.695 --> 00:16:39.131
Oh, I'm done!
Guys, I'm done!

00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:40.265 align:end position:100%
-Oh, you did it.
-That was fast.

00:16:41.232 --> 00:16:43.602
[man]
That looks sadly random.

00:16:44.602 --> 00:16:48.373
That almost looks like it's
going to resolve into something.

00:16:48.406 --> 00:16:49.708
[woman]
Maybe it's a map.

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:52.811
-Those aren't letters, are they?
-They could be.

00:16:52.844 --> 00:16:55.380
[man]
No, they're all back half
of the alphabet, then.

00:16:55.413 --> 00:16:56.782 size:69% position:66%
Except for
little nine over here.

00:16:56.815 --> 00:16:58.450
Little nine. Look at that little
nine.

00:16:58.483 --> 00:17:01.086
-[woman] Baby nine.
-[man] That's an "I", right?

00:17:01.119 --> 00:17:02.454
I'm pretty sure
there's nothing there.

00:17:02.487 --> 00:17:03.555
There's no pattern here.

00:17:03.588 --> 00:17:06.258
Do we agree, like, this probably
looks like nothing?

00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:09.461
[woman]
Yeah, I don't think going any
further with this is really...

00:17:09.494 --> 00:17:10.629
-Productive.
-Okay.

00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:12.364
<i> Our group had followed
 the clues correctly</i>

00:17:12.397 --> 00:17:13.532
<i> and built out an image,</i>

00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:16.268
<i> even though there wasn't one
 that made sense.</i>

00:17:16.301 --> 00:17:18.804
<i> And, incredibly, they didn't
 try to make sense of it.</i>

00:17:18.837 --> 00:17:19.972
<i> Within a matter of minutes,</i>

00:17:20.005 --> 00:17:22.340
<i> they realized it was random
 and moved on.</i>

00:17:22.373 --> 00:17:24.776
<i> So it was time to let them in
 on the ruse.</i>

00:17:24.809 --> 00:17:26.311 align:start position:0%
Hello, again.

00:17:26.344 --> 00:17:30.082
All right, so,
this is Steve Vance.

00:17:30.115 --> 00:17:32.217
He's taken the day off
from JPL.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.186 size:78% position:39%
Have you learned anything
about the message?

00:17:34.219 --> 00:17:35.320
What do you know?

00:17:35.353 --> 00:17:38.090
It seems very random still.

00:17:38.123 --> 00:17:39.658
Though it did have a nice prime
factorization.

00:17:39.691 --> 00:17:41.259
That did not seem
random to me.

00:17:41.292 --> 00:17:45.197
Let me show you guys
something new.

00:17:46.197 --> 00:17:47.499 size:44% position:78%
[man]
What the heck?

00:17:47.532 --> 00:17:49.134 align:start size:75% position:25%
It looks like 23 across.

00:17:49.167 --> 00:17:50.836
-I see how you're doing this.
-Oh, we were almost there!

00:17:50.869 --> 00:17:53.305
We tried arranging
these ones and zeros

00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:54.539
kind of in these blocks.

00:17:54.572 --> 00:17:56.274
[woman] But there's some
patterns repeating there

00:17:56.307 --> 00:17:59.211
that we don't actually have
mapped correctly here.

00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:02.614
[Michael]
Now, this is not the message
that you're looking at.

00:18:02.647 --> 00:18:05.084
This is the famous
Arecibo message.

00:18:05.884 --> 00:18:09.855
Now, what you have been
working on

00:18:09.888 --> 00:18:12.858
is this message,

00:18:12.891 --> 00:18:14.392
but randomized.

00:18:14.425 --> 00:18:15.694
[laughs]

00:18:15.727 --> 00:18:16.862 align:start size:41% position:59%
Thanks a lot.

00:18:16.895 --> 00:18:19.131
[all laugh]

00:18:19.164 --> 00:18:21.666
Oh, I'm just going to collapse
on the ground now.

00:18:21.699 --> 00:18:24.169
In a way, you guys were
quite successful.

00:18:24.202 --> 00:18:25.871
You, first of all,

00:18:25.904 --> 00:18:29.341
recognized the semi-prime nature
of this message very quickly,

00:18:29.374 --> 00:18:31.276
and tried to build an image.

00:18:31.309 --> 00:18:32.477
I was wondering
if you would start

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:35.213
to see things there
that weren't.

00:18:35.246 --> 00:18:37.883
But it didn't really happen,
did it?

00:18:37.916 --> 00:18:40.252
I think the real reason
that we weren't interpreting

00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:41.286 align:start position:0%
anything out of that

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.488
is we were looking
for clearly defined patterns.

00:18:43.521 --> 00:18:45.490
We're looking
for something like this.

00:18:45.523 --> 00:18:47.325
This is actually
what we're looking for.

00:18:47.358 --> 00:18:48.927
Even symmetry would have been
a big thing for me.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.529 size:75% position:38%
If I'd seen any symmetry
in these patterns,

00:18:50.562 --> 00:18:52.430 size:66% position:33%
I would have said,
"This is not random."

00:18:52.463 --> 00:18:53.798 size:59% position:30%
I'm also interested
in knowing

00:18:53.831 --> 00:18:56.835 size:59% position:30%
the best kind
of message to send,

00:18:56.868 --> 00:18:59.604
because I have an opportunity
to send a message.

00:18:59.637 --> 00:19:01.706
You know, a marker
to where we are

00:19:01.739 --> 00:19:03.441 size:78% position:61%
is kind of
the biggest thing for me,

00:19:03.474 --> 00:19:05.944
but then it's like, do we really
want to tell them where we are?

00:19:05.977 --> 00:19:07.646
Is that something--
Do we want them to come visit?

00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:09.481
-I don't know.
-What do you guys think?

00:19:09.514 --> 00:19:13.185
Should we be sending messages
to outer space?

00:19:13.218 --> 00:19:14.352 size:31% position:84%
[all]
Yeah, yes.

00:19:14.385 --> 00:19:15.153 size:75% position:63%
[Matthew]
I don't think we should.

00:19:15.186 --> 00:19:17.222
Every single time
any civilization

00:19:17.255 --> 00:19:19.457
encounters any other
civilization,

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:21.960
and one is technologically
advanced, one guy gets crushed.

00:19:21.993 --> 00:19:24.930
You know, what if they're not
more advanced than us?

00:19:24.963 --> 00:19:25.998
What if we're at the same place,

00:19:26.031 --> 00:19:29.935
and the only way we can
communicate is like this?

00:19:29.968 --> 00:19:34.472
What if we can just exchange
the recipe for fusion?

00:19:34.505 --> 00:19:37.309
We would have so much to learn
from those people,

00:19:37.342 --> 00:19:41.279
and really nothing to lose
in that situation.

00:19:41.312 --> 00:19:42.180
You're making an argument

00:19:42.213 --> 00:19:43.381
that we almost have
a moral imperative

00:19:43.414 --> 00:19:46.218
to send our knowledge to share
with other civilizations.

00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:47.852
-Absolutely, yes.
-It's a really interesting
point.

00:19:47.885 --> 00:19:49.521
That's kind of where I land.

00:19:49.554 --> 00:19:50.889
Let's just think of this
as a way

00:19:50.922 --> 00:19:53.625
to preserve the stories
that we've been able to tell,

00:19:53.658 --> 00:19:56.328
which, by the way, we tell
better than the universe does.

00:19:56.361 --> 00:19:59.631
Thank you all so much.
This was a phenomenal exercise.

00:19:59.664 --> 00:20:01.767
[all]
Thanks. Thank you.

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:08.506
You know, honestly, I thought
that the human tendency

00:20:08.539 --> 00:20:12.911
to find meaning where there is
none would more quickly emerge.

00:20:12.944 --> 00:20:14.713
But that didn't really happen.

00:20:14.746 --> 00:20:18.350
What I also didn't expect
was just how educational

00:20:18.383 --> 00:20:19.985
the whole challenge
would be.

00:20:20.018 --> 00:20:23.588
I mean, I saw some human flaws
and biases at work,

00:20:23.621 --> 00:20:27.626
but more generally,
I saw the human mind at work,

00:20:27.659 --> 00:20:29.427
who we are.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.495
Which kind of makes sense,
right?

00:20:30.528 --> 00:20:32.897
I mean, the Voyager
Golden Record

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:36.368
really isn't just a neat thing
for extraterrestrials.

00:20:36.401 --> 00:20:42.007 line:0%
It's a neat archive by,
of and for us.

00:20:45.076 --> 00:20:47.479
I don't think we will all
ever agree

00:20:47.512 --> 00:20:49.547
about whether or not
we should be sending messages

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.784
to outer space
announcing that we are here.

00:20:52.817 --> 00:20:53.651
But here's the thing.

00:20:53.685 --> 00:20:56.554
Sending focused messages
to outer space

00:20:56.587 --> 00:20:59.557
requires technology
that not all of us have.

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.660
So only those with access

00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:04.362
can say hello to
extraterrestrials if they want.

00:21:04.395 --> 00:21:07.465
But who chose them
to speak for us,

00:21:07.498 --> 00:21:09.734
for all of Earth?

00:21:09.767 --> 00:21:11.936
Well, I've come here,
to Vazquez Rocks State Park,

00:21:11.969 --> 00:21:14.572
to talk to a man
who is changing that.

00:21:14.605 --> 00:21:18.043
He is democratizing active SETI,
because the service he has built

00:21:18.076 --> 00:21:21.346
is allowing anyone to send
any message they want

00:21:21.379 --> 00:21:23.014
to outer space.

00:21:23.047 --> 00:21:25.717 line:0%
<i> He's an expert in the field
 of alien communication</i>

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:27.852 line:0%
<i> with a doctorate in elementary
 particle physics,</i>

00:21:27.885 --> 00:21:31.990
<i> and he's the one who's going
 to help me send my message.</i>

00:21:32.023 --> 00:21:35.694
Tell me about the way
you are talking to aliens

00:21:35.727 --> 00:21:37.729
and helping other
people do it.

00:21:37.762 --> 00:21:41.099
Well, I have built a website,
called SpaceSpeak.com.

00:21:41.132 --> 00:21:44.469
And it allows people
to send a text in audio

00:21:44.502 --> 00:21:47.605
or a image message
out into space.

00:21:47.638 --> 00:21:52.077
My view is, as many people
that can reach out to aliens

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:54.946
or the universe in general,
the better.

00:21:54.979 --> 00:21:57.749
What are you using
to transmit these messages?

00:21:57.782 --> 00:22:00.819 size:88% position:56%
Radio waves. Radio waves are
just another form of photon.

00:22:00.852 --> 00:22:04.889
And once a photon is broadcast
into space, it persists.

00:22:04.922 --> 00:22:07.125
It never dies.
It never decays.

00:22:07.158 --> 00:22:09.761
A million years from now,
maybe the earth is gone,

00:22:09.794 --> 00:22:11.963
maybe the solar system is gone,

00:22:11.996 --> 00:22:14.566 size:59% position:70%
but your message
is still out there,

00:22:14.599 --> 00:22:17.535 align:start size:69% position:31%
and essentially become
archaeological photons

00:22:17.568 --> 00:22:21.906 align:start size:81% position:19%
for some future generation
to see what we were about.

00:22:21.939 --> 00:22:24.042
-I want to do this.
-Absolutely, let's do it.

00:22:24.075 --> 00:22:25.510
-Awesome.
-Great.

00:22:27.478 --> 00:22:28.913
Going to take a chair
right here.

00:22:28.946 --> 00:22:31.049
-And...
-This is it.

00:22:31.082 --> 00:22:32.984 size:72% position:36%
This is the Space Speak
transmitter.

00:22:33.017 --> 00:22:34.986
This is a transmitter box here.

00:22:35.019 --> 00:22:37.823 size:59% position:30%
And the antenna
is right back here.

00:22:38.423 --> 00:22:39.991
I've been thinking
about this a lot,

00:22:40.024 --> 00:22:41.559
and I've spoken
to a lot of people

00:22:41.592 --> 00:22:46.798 size:78% position:61%
about what to send,
how to write the message,

00:22:46.831 --> 00:22:48.666
and whether or not
I should send anything at all.

00:22:48.699 --> 00:22:51.069
I don't think this is something
to take as fact.

00:22:51.102 --> 00:22:53.405
It's my personal opinion.

00:22:53.438 --> 00:22:56.708
I don't have any fear
that this is dangerous.

00:22:56.741 --> 00:22:58.877
-Yeah.
-I spent a lot of time

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:00.145
constructing what I believe

00:23:00.178 --> 00:23:03.681
to be a really neat,
clever idea.

00:23:03.714 --> 00:23:05.884
I was going to not send
a two-dimensional image

00:23:05.917 --> 00:23:06.918 align:start size:53% position:47%
like the Arecibo,

00:23:06.952 --> 00:23:09.187
but a three-dimensional image
made of voxels.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.822
And I got really into this.

00:23:10.855 --> 00:23:14.993
And then after talking to you
and really thinking about

00:23:15.026 --> 00:23:19.998 size:81% position:59%
the point of communicating
with outer space,

00:23:20.031 --> 00:23:21.866 align:start size:41% position:59%
beyond Earth,

00:23:21.899 --> 00:23:24.569 align:start size:50% position:50%
I...I just think

00:23:24.602 --> 00:23:28.473
to decide what to say
and how to say it.

00:23:28.506 --> 00:23:32.143
is an exercise in learning
how we communicate at all.

00:23:32.176 --> 00:23:34.145
-Yes.
-It's always coming back

00:23:34.178 --> 00:23:35.514
to who we are.

00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:38.917 size:81% position:59%
My grandmother passed away
a few days ago.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:40.585 align:start position:0%
I'm so sorry
to hear that.

00:23:40.618 --> 00:23:43.221
I'm actually leaving tomorrow
to her funeral,

00:23:43.254 --> 00:23:46.057
and I'll get to see
all of my family.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:49.127
And obviously I'm never going
to forget my grandma.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.630
And the way she, you know,
made me who I am,

00:23:52.663 --> 00:23:56.067
that will, in a way, like echo
like ripples in a pond, right?

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.802
For generations to come.

00:23:57.835 --> 00:24:02.207
But this is a message
made of light

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:07.012
that will be around forever...

00:24:07.778 --> 00:24:10.215
until the universe ends,
somehow.

00:24:10.248 --> 00:24:12.183
So I have the last photograph

00:24:12.216 --> 00:24:14.219
that was ever taken
of us together.

00:24:14.252 --> 00:24:16.955
I'd like to send
that picture out.

00:24:16.988 --> 00:24:19.124
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

00:24:22.727 --> 00:24:24.796
This photo is her
in the hospital,

00:24:24.829 --> 00:24:27.866
using one of those, like,
grabber tools, you know,

00:24:27.899 --> 00:24:30.235
to pull my beard hairs
and hurt me.

00:24:30.268 --> 00:24:31.169
[laughs]

00:24:31.203 --> 00:24:34.138
And she was so weak,
but with that tool,

00:24:34.171 --> 00:24:35.540
she could pinch.

00:24:35.573 --> 00:24:36.908
-Oh, that's awesome.
-It's a great picture

00:24:36.941 --> 00:24:38.477
of who we were.

00:24:39.277 --> 00:24:42.280
She wasn't a big fan of aliens

00:24:42.313 --> 00:24:43.781
as far as I know,

00:24:43.814 --> 00:24:46.618
but it's us
caught in this moment

00:24:46.651 --> 00:24:48.586
that I think I want
to remember,

00:24:48.619 --> 00:24:50.288
and I want the universe
to remember.

00:24:50.321 --> 00:24:53.024
So...

00:24:53.057 --> 00:24:53.691 align:start size:56% position:44%
well, let's do it.

00:24:53.725 --> 00:24:56.228
Yeah. Go ahead and hit "send."

00:24:57.295 --> 00:24:59.797 size:53% position:73%
Wow. It's sent.
And look at that.

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:04.802 size:84% position:58%
-It's already 229,435 miles
away from Earth.
-Yes.

00:25:04.835 --> 00:25:07.205
I don't think she ever traveled
that far in her entire life.

00:25:07.238 --> 00:25:09.140
-Now she has.
-She has now, absolutely.

00:25:09.173 --> 00:25:11.943
[Michael]
And she will continue traveling.

00:25:11.976 --> 00:25:15.213
Your grandmother
will touch the universe. Yeah.

00:25:15.246 --> 00:25:16.648
Peter, thank you
very much.

00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:19.684 size:81% position:41%
You are very welcome, sir.
It was a pleasure.

00:25:22.053 --> 00:25:23.755
