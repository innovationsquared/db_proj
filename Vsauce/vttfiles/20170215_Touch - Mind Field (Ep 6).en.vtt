and can fool the brain.

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:19.185
One of my favorite
physical illusions

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:21.220 line:0%
is the thermal grill illusion.

and you can do it
right at home.

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:26.492
I have some hot dog halves
in an ice bath.

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:28.628
I also have warm
hot dog halves.

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:32.098
Now what I'm going to do
is marry the halves together

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:35.668
so that they alternate,
warm, cool.

00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:37.503
Warm, cool.

00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:41.707
When I'm done,
I will have a torture device.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.078
But not one that hurts
your body,

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:49.248
one that hurts your mind.

00:08:13.091 --> 00:08:15.294
<i> - Here's another test
 of our nocebo.</i>

00:08:15.327 --> 00:08:18.063
<i> Will she feel an increase
 in her level of pain</i>

00:08:18.096 --> 00:08:20.165
<i> if she expects to?</i>
 - You ready?

00:08:20.198 --> 00:08:22.635
- Mm-hmm.
[machine humming]

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:24.970
<i> - Keep in mind,
 level two is fake.</i>

00:08:25.003 --> 00:08:27.172
<i> We're not doing anything
 different than before,</i>

00:08:27.205 --> 00:08:29.542
<i> meaning nothing
 is happening to her.</i>

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:31.977 align:start position:0%
- So, yeah, it started off
higher

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.612 align:start position:0%
than the last time,
I think.

00:08:33.645 --> 00:08:37.950 align:start position:0%
It's definitely, like,
already stinging.

00:08:37.983 --> 00:08:41.153
<i> - Immediately, she reports
 increased pain on level two.</i>

00:08:41.186 --> 00:08:42.588 align:start size:50% position:50%
It's 15 seconds.

00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:44.957 align:start position:0%
- It feels really, really,
really hot and,

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:46.158 align:start position:0%
like, penetrating.

00:08:46.191 --> 00:08:48.327
- How deep?
- Um...

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.695
- 30 seconds.
- I don't know, like,

00:08:49.728 --> 00:08:51.664
1/2 and inch or, like,
an inch.

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:56.001
Yeah, it is...
it's very hot.

00:08:56.034 --> 00:09:00.339
Um, like burning.

00:09:00.372 --> 00:09:03.309 align:start position:0%
Like my whole arm is, like,
on fire.

00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:07.813
- We can stop at any time.
- You want to call it?

00:09:07.846 --> 00:09:11.684
- Yeah.
- Okay, we're off.

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:13.686
- Do you need a tissue?
- Yeah, thank you.

00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:15.854
- You're welcome.
- [sniffs]

00:09:15.887 --> 00:09:19.992 align:end position:100%
- Could you rank for me
how you felt at level two?

00:09:20.025 --> 00:09:21.961 align:start position:0%
- Like 9 1/2.

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:24.830
<i> - The power of suggestion
 was so strong,</i>

00:09:24.863 --> 00:09:27.032
<i> our nocebo caused our subject
 to think</i>

00:09:27.065 --> 00:09:30.703
<i> she felt almost the worst pain
 imaginable.</i>

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:34.006
<i> Other subject felt different
 imaginary sensations.</i>

00:09:34.039 --> 00:09:36.008
- The muscles are kind of, uh,

00:09:36.041 --> 00:09:37.943 align:start position:0%
kind of burning
a little bit.

00:09:37.976 --> 00:09:40.980
- Stop.
- How did that feel?

00:09:41.013 --> 00:09:43.015 size:81% position:41%
- That was, like, a seven.

00:09:43.048 --> 00:09:45.050 align:start position:0%
Actually it's tingling
a lot more now

00:09:45.083 --> 00:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
than it was before.

00:09:47.352 --> 00:09:49.855
<i> - I was surprised
 at the intense reaction</i>

00:09:49.888 --> 00:09:52.124
<i> some subjects had to a feeling
 that was created</i>

00:09:52.157 --> 00:09:54.093
<i> only in their minds.</i>

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:58.263 align:end position:100%
- Look, I'm gonna stop it now.
That was 45 seconds.

00:09:58.296 --> 00:10:01.767 align:end position:100%
Describe for me the sensations
that you were having.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.002 align:start position:0%
- It felt like
a little prickle

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:06.271 align:start position:0%
like when you get
goose bumps.

00:10:06.304 --> 00:10:08.273
<i> - What about our original
 subject</i>

00:10:08.306 --> 00:10:11.944
<i> who experienced a severe
 9 1/2 on the pain scale?</i>

00:10:11.977 --> 00:10:14.980
<i> How will she feel when she
 learns it was all in her head?</i>

00:10:15.013 --> 00:10:16.882 align:end position:100%
I want to debrief you
on everything

00:10:16.915 --> 00:10:18.117 align:start size:72% position:28%
that we're up to today.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.286 align:end position:100%
So this is
a psychology program,

00:10:21.319 --> 00:10:24.857 align:end position:100%
and this equipment is not
doing anything to you.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.126 align:end position:100%
This is just a machine
that makes noise.

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:29.895 align:end position:100%
And that's just a laser pointer
on a lamp.

00:10:29.928 --> 00:10:31.363
- For real?
- For real.

00:10:31.396 --> 00:10:33.766
- Oh, my God. [laughing]
- You were never in danger.

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:35.434
- We didn't do anything to you.
- Oh, my God.

00:10:35.467 --> 00:10:39.171 align:end position:100%
- This is an investigation
in pain anticipation.

00:10:39.204 --> 00:10:42.307
- Yeah, that worked.
- I was so scared. [laughing]

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.743 align:start position:0%
I was so close to, like,
going to, like,

00:10:44.776 --> 00:10:46.278 align:start position:0%
just say, "You know what?
I changed my mind."

00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:48.147 size:81% position:41%
I was so close to leaving.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.949 align:end position:100%
- You did say that you felt
a prickle.

00:10:50.982 --> 00:10:53.152
- Uh-huh.
- How do you feel about that?

00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:55.220 align:start position:0%
- Whether it was really
I did get goose bumps

00:10:55.253 --> 00:10:57.356 align:start position:0%
or I was nervous,
which is why I felt it.

00:10:57.389 --> 00:10:59.324 size:81% position:41%
I know, as a person, like,

00:10:59.357 --> 00:11:00.993 align:start position:0%
if I think there's going
to be pain,

00:11:01.026 --> 00:11:02.127 size:78% position:39%
I'm gonna feel something.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.929 align:start position:0%
- I do still feel, like,
kind of like

00:11:03.962 --> 00:11:05.330 align:start position:0%
a burning sensation
on my arms.

00:11:05.363 --> 00:11:06.965
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:11:06.998 --> 00:11:09.201
<i> - The power of suggestion
 is so strong</i>

00:11:09.234 --> 00:11:12.805
<i> that this subject continued to
 imagine a physical sensation,</i>

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:14.940
<i> even after learning
 it wasn't real.</i>

00:11:14.973 --> 00:11:18.243 align:end position:100%
The name for the effect
is the nocebo effect.

00:11:18.276 --> 00:11:21.814 align:end position:100%
It's a negative effect caused
by nothing but the mind.

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:23.449 align:start position:0%
- It makes perfect sense,
you know,

00:11:23.482 --> 00:11:25.150 size:75% position:38%
the power of suggestion.

00:11:25.183 --> 00:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
I'm shaky just thinking
about it.

00:11:34.226 --> 00:11:37.763
- Pain and touch are weird.

00:11:37.796 --> 00:11:40.299
But what about when touch
straddles the line

00:11:40.332 --> 00:11:42.835
between pleasure and pain?

00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:44.970
When a sensation
makes you laugh

00:11:45.003 --> 00:11:47.005
and drives you crazy.

00:11:47.038 --> 00:11:48.974
I'm talking about tickling.

00:11:49.007 --> 00:11:51.076
<i> Part of what makes you laugh
 when you're tickled</i>

00:11:51.109 --> 00:11:52.811
<i> is the element of surprise.</i>

00:11:52.844 --> 00:11:55.080
<i> Your brain doesn't know
 exactly what to expect</i>

00:11:55.113 --> 00:11:56.448
<i> or when it's going to happen.</i>

00:11:56.481 --> 00:11:59.051
<i> On the other hand,
 it's impossible</i>

00:11:59.084 --> 00:12:00.819
<i> to tickle yourself.</i>

00:12:00.852 --> 00:12:03.789
<i> If the brain knows
 where and when and how</i>

00:12:03.822 --> 00:12:06.859
<i> you are going to be touched,
 you won't laugh.</i>

00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:09.027
But professors of cognitive
neuroscience

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.896
at the University College
London

00:12:10.929 --> 00:12:14.166 line:0%
have invented
the tickle machine.

00:12:14.199 --> 00:12:16.268 line:0%
<i> Subjects sit in
 the tickle machine</i>

00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:17.936 line:0%
<i> with their feet against
 a brush</i>

00:12:17.969 --> 00:12:19.471 line:0%
<i> that is connected
 to a handle.</i>

00:12:19.504 --> 00:12:21.974
<i> At first, when the subjects
 turn the handle,</i>

00:12:22.007 --> 00:12:24.443
<i> the brush rotates
 at the exact same time</i>

00:12:24.476 --> 00:12:26.411
<i> resulting in no tickling.</i>

00:12:26.444 --> 00:12:29.348
<i> Then the machine is switched
 into tickle mode...</i>

00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:31.784
- [laughing] 
<i> -  Which causes a delay</i>

00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:33.452
<i> of less than a second
 between when the subject</i>

00:12:33.485 --> 00:12:35.454
<i> turns the handle
 and when the brush moves</i>

00:12:35.487 --> 00:12:36.922
<i> against their foot.</i>

00:12:36.955 --> 00:12:39.391
- [laughing]
<i> - This slight change</i>

00:12:39.424 --> 00:12:41.059
<i> is enough to prevent
 the brain's cerebellum</i>

00:12:41.092 --> 00:12:42.928
<i> from predicting
 the sensation,</i>

00:12:42.961 --> 00:12:45.931
<i> thus allowing the subject
 to respond to the tickle.</i>

00:12:45.964 --> 00:12:47.933 align:start size:38% position:63%
- [laughing]

00:12:47.966 --> 00:12:49.334
- Tickles can be fun.

00:12:49.367 --> 00:12:52.337
Pain, not so much.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:56.441
If you couldn't feel pain,
that would be great, right?

00:12:56.474 --> 00:12:58.143
Or would it?

00:12:58.176 --> 00:13:01.079
Let's meet Steve Pete.

00:13:01.112 --> 00:13:03.448
Steve, I understand
you don't feel pain.

00:13:03.481 --> 00:13:05.450 align:end position:100%
- Yes, I was born
with a rare genetic condition

00:13:05.483 --> 00:13:08.220 align:end position:100% line:0%
called congenital insensitivity
to pain.

00:13:08.253 --> 00:13:10.956
It only affects about 40 to 50
of us around the world with it.

00:13:10.989 --> 00:13:12.424
- Only 40 or 50 people?
- Yeah.

00:13:12.457 --> 00:13:14.226 align:end position:100%
So far that we've been able
to find.

00:13:14.259 --> 00:13:16.995 align:start position:0%
- And tell me what it means when
you say you don't feel pain.

00:13:17.028 --> 00:13:19.464 align:end position:100% line:0%
- Pain is used
to detect injury

00:13:19.497 --> 00:13:21.333 align:end position:100% line:0%
and it kind of sends a signal
to your brain saying,

00:13:21.366 --> 00:13:23.836 align:end position:100% line:0%
"Hey, don't do this anymore."
It's an alarm system.

00:13:23.869 --> 00:13:26.104 align:end position:100%
So what happens
with my condition is

00:13:26.137 --> 00:13:27.539 align:start size:72% position:28%
we feel what's going on

00:13:27.572 --> 00:13:29.408 align:end position:100%
like if I were to touch
your shoulder,

00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:31.009 align:end position:100%
you would feel me
touching your shoulder,

00:13:31.042 --> 00:13:33.011 align:start size:69% position:31%
but if I were to touch
your shoulder in a way

00:13:33.044 --> 00:13:36.014 align:end position:100%
that's painful,
I would feel just a pressure,

00:13:36.047 --> 00:13:39.117 align:end position:100%
and the signal of pain
would not travel to my brain.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.253
- Okay, so you feel everything--
- Everything else.

00:13:41.286 --> 00:13:44.423 align:start position:0%
that I feel,
but you just don't feel pain.

00:13:44.456 --> 00:13:46.391
- Yeah. Correct.
- But that could be dangerous.

00:13:46.424 --> 00:13:49.361 size:88% position:44%
How did you first find out
that you had this condition?

00:13:49.394 --> 00:13:51.330 align:end position:100%
- Well, what happened was
I was teething

00:13:51.363 --> 00:13:54.032 align:end position:100%
and I chewed
part of my tongue off.

00:13:54.065 --> 00:13:56.368 align:end position:100%
<i> So my parents quickly took me
 to my pediatrician.</i>

00:13:56.401 --> 00:13:58.904
- Wow. Are you ticklish?
- Yes.

00:13:58.937 --> 00:14:00.072
- Do you itch?
- Yes.

00:14:00.105 --> 00:14:01.540
- Do you like massages?
- Yes.

00:14:01.573 --> 00:14:03.508
- Do you take painkillers?
- No.

00:14:03.541 --> 00:14:05.277
- What about a headache?
- No.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.914
- What about spicy peppers?
- I enjoy them, yeah.

00:14:08.947 --> 00:14:11.950 align:end position:100%
I mean, I do sense
the burning sensation,

00:14:11.983 --> 00:14:13.185 align:start size:63% position:38%
but nothing painful.

00:14:13.218 --> 00:14:17.189 align:start position:0%
- What about intestine pain
like gas pain?

00:14:17.222 --> 00:14:18.624 align:end position:100%
- That's something
I don't feel,

00:14:18.657 --> 00:14:22.327 align:end position:100%
so that kind of ties into
one of my biggest fears,

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.162 align:end position:100%
which is having, like,
appendicitis

00:14:24.195 --> 00:14:26.164 align:end position:100%
or any other type
of internal damage

00:14:26.197 --> 00:14:28.433 align:end position:100%
that I just don't know about
until it's too late.

00:14:28.466 --> 00:14:29.935
- Is there an upside to this?

00:14:29.968 --> 00:14:31.470 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that people,
often naively,

00:14:31.503 --> 00:14:32.938
hear that you don't feel pain...
- Yeah.

00:14:32.971 --> 00:14:34.039 align:start position:0%
- And they think,
"Oh, man.

00:14:34.072 --> 00:14:35.240 align:start position:0%
Well, you should become
a boxer."

00:14:35.273 --> 00:14:37.276 align:end position:100%
- The only upside to it is,
uh,

00:14:37.309 --> 00:14:40.012
<i> being that I have had so many
 injuries during my childhood,</i>

00:14:40.045 --> 00:14:42.514
<i> as I get older, I won't feel
 the pain that comes with it.</i>

00:14:42.547 --> 00:14:44.082
<i> Other than that, really,</i>

00:14:44.115 --> 00:14:45.651
<i> I just try to live
 my life normally</i>

00:14:45.684 --> 00:14:47.152
<i> as everyone else does.</i>

00:14:47.185 --> 00:14:49.421 align:start position:0%
- I cannot describe
pain to you.

00:14:49.454 --> 00:14:52.291
Just like you can't describe
a color to someone who's blind.

00:14:52.324 --> 00:14:54.059 align:end position:100%
- Which is where I run into
my problem

00:14:54.092 --> 00:14:56.662 align:end position:100%
with trying to describe
what not feeling pain is like.

00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:58.563 align:start position:0%
- Wow, I'll bet.

00:14:58.596 --> 00:15:00.032 align:start position:0%
Well, Steve,
thank you very much.

00:15:00.065 --> 00:15:04.303 align:start position:0%
This was really,
really fascinating.

00:15:04.336 --> 00:15:09.574
<i> So not being able to feel pain
 is actually a bad thing.</i>

00:15:09.607 --> 00:15:13.412
But likewise, the anticipation
of pain can be bad too.

00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:17.482
Just making someone think
that they might be tortured soon

00:15:17.515 --> 00:15:19.451
could be a torture device.

00:15:19.484 --> 00:15:22.054
<i> The CIA and Guantanamo Bay
 are known</i>

00:15:22.087 --> 00:15:24.222
<i> for using
 psychological torture</i>

00:15:24.255 --> 00:15:26.692
<i> involving the anticipation
 of pain</i>

00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:30.228
<i> against prisoners
 in the war on terror.</i>

00:15:30.261 --> 00:15:34.967
The effects of this type
of torture can last a lifetime.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.468
So what's worse?

00:15:36.501 --> 00:15:41.573
Waiting for pain to happen
or the pain itself?

00:15:41.606 --> 00:15:43.542
You might be surprised.

00:15:46.678 --> 00:15:48.647
<i> We're basing our investigation</i>

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.249

 experiment,</i>

00:15:51.282 --> 00:15:54.252
<i> conducted at the
 University College London,</i>

00:15:54.285 --> 00:15:56.254
<i> which gave subject
 two options.</i>

00:15:56.287 --> 00:15:59.725
<i> Option one: Experience
 intense pain right away.</i>

00:15:59.758 --> 00:16:04.129
<i> Or option two: Anticipate
 a lower level of pain</i>

00:16:04.162 --> 00:16:06.131
<i> in intervals
 every few minutes.</i>

00:16:06.164 --> 00:16:09.401
<i> Researchers found that the
 psychological effects of dread</i>

00:16:09.434 --> 00:16:14.139
<i> can often be worse
 than the pain itself.</i>

00:16:14.172 --> 00:16:16.341
<i> We decided to demonstrate
 the phenomenon</i>

00:16:16.374 --> 00:16:18.610
<i> by setting up
 a fake research study.</i>

00:16:18.643 --> 00:16:21.146 align:start size:59% position:41%
We are looking into

00:16:21.179 --> 00:16:23.148 align:end position:100%
the effects of electrical
stimulation on the body.

00:16:23.181 --> 00:16:25.550

- It's all completely harmless.

00:16:25.583 --> 00:16:27.552 line:0%
But it can be unpleasant.
- Right.

00:16:27.585 --> 00:16:29.388 align:end position:100%
- So we'll show you
the two settings, all right?

00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:32.591
I want to show you first what we
call the light setting, okay?

00:16:32.624 --> 00:16:35.127
- Okay.
- You ready?

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.595
- I guess so.

00:16:36.628 --> 00:16:38.330
[buzzing]
Oh.

00:16:38.363 --> 00:16:40.132 align:end position:100%

the high setting.

00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:42.267
[buzzing]
- Ow.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.336
- Okay.
- I don't--[laughing]

00:16:44.369 --> 00:16:47.439 align:end position:100%
- All right, so again,
unpleasant definitely...

00:16:47.472 --> 00:16:48.774
- Yeah.
- But you're safe.

00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:51.410 align:end position:100%
We call this the low voltage
or light shock.

00:16:51.443 --> 00:16:52.611
- Okay.
- Ready?

00:16:52.644 --> 00:16:55.047

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.149
[buzzing]
Hmm, okay.

00:16:57.182 --> 00:17:00.819
- And now we'll show you the
high voltage or higher shock.

00:17:00.852 --> 00:17:02.587 align:start position:0%

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.289

00:17:04.322 --> 00:17:06.158

- Okay.

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:07.692

 for our subjects</i>

00:17:07.725 --> 00:17:09.361
<i> to make an important choice.</i>

00:17:09.394 --> 00:17:11.763 align:end position:100%
All right, so now that you know
the two differences,

00:17:11.796 --> 00:17:14.666 align:end position:100%
you either can choose
choice A,

00:17:14.699 --> 00:17:18.670
which is one high voltage shock
every ten seconds for a minute.

00:17:18.703 --> 00:17:21.106
- Mm-hmm.
<i> - Will our subjects choose</i>

00:17:21.139 --> 00:17:23.141
<i> the higher,
 more painful shocks,</i>

00:17:23.174 --> 00:17:25.177

 right away?</i>

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:30.315 align:end position:100%
Or choice B
is one low voltage shock

00:17:30.348 --> 00:17:33.418 align:end position:100%
every ten minutes
for one hour.

00:17:33.451 --> 00:17:36.221

 the pain for ten minutes</i>
