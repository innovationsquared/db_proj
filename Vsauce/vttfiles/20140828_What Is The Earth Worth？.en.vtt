00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.760
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.960
Earth only contains 1066 people.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.200
Earth, Texas.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.580
The only place on Earth officially named Earth.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.240
There are at least two places named
Moon

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.500
but the Earth only has one astronomical
Moon.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.470
Or does it? From September 2006 to June
2007, Earth had an additional Moon

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.340
named 2006 RH120. It's a near Earth

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.100
asteroid that usually orbits around
the Sun but for 13 months

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.470
it fell into an orbit around our planet
and became

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.960
another Moon of Earth. We can call it that
because technically

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.980
a Moon is just a natural satellite. Something in

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.519
orbit around a planet that humans
didn't put there.

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.039
There's no official minimum size
requirement for Moon status.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.239
The Moon, it's a Moon.

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.400
Sputnik, space junk, the International
Space Station -

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.339
not Moons, they are artificial satellites.

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.710
Astronomers believe that, most of the
time,

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.509
Earth has additional Moons. These
newcomers don't always stick around that

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:15.299
long and they tend to only be about

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.350
a meter in diameter, so we don't always

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.560
detect them and they could, less sensationally,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.700
be called temporary asteroid moons. But,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.369
the vagueness of the word Moon means that, yes, technically

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.240
Earth usually has more than one

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.320
and Earth is booking it. I mean we're
moving through space

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.939
incredibly quickly. A light year is an
almost

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.950
unfathomable distance to put in the human
terms

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.280
but our solar system orbits around the
center of the Milky Way

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.660
at about 782,000 kilometres an hour.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.240
Which means, that from the perspective of the center of

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.659
our galaxy, about every 1300 years

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.859
Earth travels an entire light year.

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:04.090
In other words, the Great Pyramid of Giza,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.459
wasn't just built 4500
years ago, it was also built

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.050
almost three-and-a-half light years away.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.980
Big deal - what's it all worth?

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.560
Could we assign a price to the entire
planet? To Earth itself?

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.850
Well, Greg Loughman, an astrophysicist at
the University of California, Santa Cruz

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.270
devised a beautiful equation for assessing the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.840
value of exoplanets we discover.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.980
It considers their habitability, their ease of being studied

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.159
and, of course, how much money we've already spent

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.680
looking for them. Funny enough, you can solve

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.299
for Earth and find out that compared to
what we've already spent looking for

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.470
exoplanets - and what we know about them - Earth is worth

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.890
about five quadrillion dollars.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.280
The History Channel famously stuck to
Earth and

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.060
rang up all of Earth's resources like
water, lumber and granite using the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.489
current market prices they arrived at a total

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.980
of seven quadrillion dollars. If you
removed and

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.670
isolated all of the elements your body
contains, and then solved them each

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.040
at market price, you could fetch about two thousand dollars.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.379
Reddit user Shady Potato applied this map

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.549
to Earth. If we could mine the entire
planet, and separate out all of it's

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.730
pure elements, and prices didn't change
because of that, we could sell it all

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.110
for 15.8 sextillion dollars.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.220
Of course calculations like
these don't include every single possible

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.319
thing earth, or any other planet has to offer,

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.569
and they also don't consider supply and demand.

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.730
If someone here on Earth, or some extraterrestrial

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.049
group of planet shoppers, had quadrillions,

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.459
sextillions of dollars, or the
equivalent amount of power,

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.150
well, they would have the option to shop
in a much

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.560
larger store. For crying out loud, there
are more than 10,000 asteroids right here

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.520
near Earth. And just one of them - 433 Eros - 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.140
is estimated to contain a half
quintillion dollars worth of platinum

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.660
alone, and by weight, even more iron.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.210
So to be more realistic, instead of
calculating Earth's value

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.600
on Earth, let's calculate its value on the

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.220
galactic marketplace, or the universal

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.690
marketplace. If you, or some
hypothetical group of

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.250
aliens, shopping for a planet could pick any planet

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.380
in the entire Milky Way galaxy, what about
Earth would make it

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.960
worth anything? The Milky Way galaxy

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.370
is estimated to contain a supply of around 100

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.919
to 400 billion planets. As far as

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.069
Earth analogues go, Kepler space mission
data suggests there were probably

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:59.120
40 billion Earth size planets orbiting
within habitable zones

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.860
of stars in our galaxy. And within the
observable universe?

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.040
Quadrillions.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.800
So, from a raw materials and habitability
stand point, Earth

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.819
probably isn't that rare. But Earth

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.660
does have some unique selling points.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.860
For one, it's probably the only planet like itself
within at least 12 light years.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.240
So its location might be prime real estate

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.669
for an intergalactic rest stop or imminent

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.940
domain. And secondly, statistically
speaking,

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.990
life as we know it might not be unique to Earth,

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.509
but there probably isn't life
elsewhere that formed exactly like it did here

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:42.060
with jaguars, palm trees and hairless
bipeds

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.000
who made the same buildings and
jokes and art and music

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:50.580
that we have. These might be the truest
unique selling points for Earth.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.820
Aliens wouldn't have to understand, or
appreciate any of it,

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.000
if it merely amused them it might
be worth purchasing as a sort of

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:01.680
museum, or zoo at the least.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.370
Of course, interstellar planet shoppers
wouldn't have

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.310
Earth currency to buy it with, and space cash

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.310
isn't worth anything here. But

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.419
the technology it would take for them to get to us

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.800
would likely be at least thousands of
years ahead of what we currently have. So,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.030
an equitable trade might be, say, limited use of Earth

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.120
in exchange for their knowledge. Or full

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.090
use - or abuse - of Earth in exchange for
their knowledge

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.340
and fair relocation of all

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.270
earthlings to some equally habitable exoplanet.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.940
Boy, this type of speculation is totally

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.300
sci-fi. But you know what's not? The next part of

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.389
establishing Earth's value:

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:49.800
demand.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.379
Despite what Earth has to offer,

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:56.129
despite what makes it unique, and despite
National Geographic's list of

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:59.690
ten reasons other life forms might want Earth

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.809
so far we have received

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:04.539
0 offers.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.500
The Fermi Paradox formally

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.460
phrases this puzzle. With so many
friendly to life as we know it

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.740
planets out there, many of which have
been around longer than

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.990
even Earth, why haven't we been visited by,

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.300
or heard from, intelligent life yet?

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.919
Maybe Earth, and its intelligent life, really are

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:28.000
rare and special. Or maybe Earth

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.069
is so typical, so unremarkable, no other
intelligent advanced lifeforms

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:37.500
could be bothered to stop by. But this
raises another question.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.979
Even if something came by, what makes us
think it would

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:45.289
make an offer? Why would it consider our wishes at all?

00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:48.289
In Star Trek 4, the aliens wanted to
talk to whales

00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:51.990
and humans were just an awkward third wheel.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.680
When Thomas Jefferson made the Louisiana
Purchase, he didn't ask,

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.560
say, squirrels in Nebraska for
permission. He just

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.620
did it. And all those squirrels were
suddenly in America,

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.849
without knowing it. For all we know, that

00:08:06.849 --> 00:08:10.400
may have already happened to us. Earth
could be owned by some larger

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.409
interstellar landlord.

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:16.509
Furthermore, this entire question rests on an
even more fundamental

00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:20.139
assumption, the assumption that other
intelligent life forms

00:08:20.139 --> 00:08:24.210
share our concept of ownership;

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.229
and the belief that physical things can
be bought

00:08:27.229 --> 00:08:30.280
and sold. Amongst earthlings, human

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.450
bartering is pretty unique. Only we have developed

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.990
complicated, socially agreed-upon norms,
for the barter of

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:42.460
goods, the use of currency for goods, or
the concept that you can

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.900
own a piece of Earth's surface.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:51.380
Sure, animals can be territorial, but they
haven't developed that into a more rigorous

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:54.649
expansive sense of fair exchange.

00:08:54.649 --> 00:08:59.060
And when it comes to an individual owning more
things than they could possibly hold

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:03.670
or defend on their own, well, we humans
have systems for that.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:08.140
We can teach some animals to use tokens
as currency to exchange for

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.360
treats, but left on their own they don't
incorporate

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.269
economic ideas into their regular social lives. At the most, we observe animals bartering

00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:18.540
amongst each other for services - 

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:25.000
but not goods. Why? Well, they may lack
the cognitive ability required to keep track of

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.750
long-term transactional histories.
But they also lack

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:34.480
two other extremely important things:
communication and enforcement.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.660
Services, like

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:40.400
grooming, are difficult to steal, so
animals can easily trade them.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.200
But without a language to facilitate

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.670
snitching, non-humans can't easily

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.380
report thefts or devise systems for reporting

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:55.840
and punishing violations. Animals create some pretty beautiful things.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.360
Bowerbird nests, Pufferfish circles,

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.870
termite mounds, or the dramatic costumes
decorator crabs fashion

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.320
out of sea floor debris.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.070
But ownership, and the right to buy or
sell what you make,

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.160
is only as useful as the power you have to enforce it.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.560
And if you don't have enough power,
someone or something else will make decisions

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.480
for you. For instance, we have decided that animals

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.360
don't own the selfies they take.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.540
Three years ago in Indonesia a monkey stole photojournalist

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.870
David Slaters' camera. He later retreived the camera and found that the monkey

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.110
had snapped these fantastic images.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:40.980
Slater maintained that he should receive
royalties from people who reproduce the images, like

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:45.040
Wikimedia, but US federal regulators
recently ruled that since a

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.279
non-human animal created these photos, they're

00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:53.619
officially in the public domain. They
belong to all of us.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.820
The same goes for selfies taken by elephants,

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.400
or lambs,

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.680
or Asian short-clawed otters, named Musa.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.600
And it's not just selfies at play here,
the same goes for paintings made by

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.900
chimpanzees

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.020
or dog artists.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.400
So, maybe Earth is worth quadrillions

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.920
or sextillions of dollars. Maybe it's worth renting

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:21.840
in exchange for technological know-how. 
But the mere fact that we can conceive of ourselves

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.640
selling our own planet is pretty
incredible.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:32.060
I mean, we don't have a deed to planet
Earth, we really only own it via finders, keepers.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:36.580
But we didn't stumble upon Earth like a hermit crab in its shell,

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:40.950
we really just emerged from it. We didn't
build Earth,

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.410
if anything, its selective pressures
built us.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:48.280
Does that mean Earth is sort of like a womb?

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:52.700
Does that mean us selling Earth would be
the same as a child selling his or her

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.660
parents?

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.440
Well, not really. Because we aren't here

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.620
for the purpose of leaving, analogous to

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:04.540
being born. Honestly, the most fitting metaphor
might be

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.900
not that we are Earth's owners, or
children,

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:12.220
or one in the same with it, but rather
that we are

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.780
Earth's first willful

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.020
effluvia.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.840
In the context of the human body,

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:22.040
effluvia are little emissions of things

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.290
built-up within. They often make us

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:30.020
giggle and can be gross. And isn't that
what we are?

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.860
A sometimes messy, stinky presence that
has built up

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.310
within and will one day inevitably, and
to the extent already have,

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:41.640
discharged out into space?

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.990
I guess what I'm saying is that putting
a price tag

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:49.180
on Earth is all speculation. We don't
know if we will never be

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.470
Earth's sales person. But what we do know

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.860
is that we are Earth's first

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:57.700
fart.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.420
And as always,

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.960
thanks for watching.
