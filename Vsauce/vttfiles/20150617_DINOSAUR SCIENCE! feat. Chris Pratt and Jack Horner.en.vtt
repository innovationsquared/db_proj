00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.379
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
What

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.140
are monsters?
Scary,

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.450
unnatural things?
Yes,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.360
but they're more than that and we knew
that back when we named them.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.430
The word monster comes from the same root word

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.400
as demonstrate and demonstrative, monere,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.740
meaning to teach, to instruct, to warn.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.980
Monsters, like dinosaurs, 
and the stories we tell about them,

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.050
have a lot to tell us about ourselves,

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.239
about the past and about the future.

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.219
This Vsauce1 video is not an ordinary video,

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.579
it is a dinosaur-dnary

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.660
video, built not just out of me talking,

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.739
but also world-famous palaeontologist 
and technical adviser to

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.449
every Jurassic Park film, Jack Horner, and

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.010
the hilarious Chris Pratt.
First things first,

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.399
scientists have so far broken Earth's
history down into 22

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.210
periods.
The Jurassic period has come and gone,

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.080
but the one we live in today is called
the Quaternary.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.300
Jurassic World is the movie that you're in.
Yes.
The thing that we're filming right now

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.400
Quaternary World.
Quaternary World.
We are organisms from the Quaternary.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.799
Quaternary Park would be, well,
basically like Universal Studios or something.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.080
Exactly. Actually, literally any place on Earth right now.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.760
Dinosaurs,

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.490
fossils.
Yeah.
Dinosaur, fossil.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.810
Fossil, fossil fuel.
Wow.
Is it safe to say that

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.830
our cars run on the ghosts of dinosaurs?

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.580
That question sounds mind-blowing,

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.270
but is it true?
Are we really fuelling our cars

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.180
with dinosaur remains?
Well, I asked paleontologist Jack Horner

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.890
and his answer is worth beginning from
the bottom or rather

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.950
from things that come out of bottoms.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.180
You'll see what I mean.
Okay, so this.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.429
Let me guess what this. Okay.
Yeah, it looks like coal almost. Well, they are, it's

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.789
actually a coprolite.
What's a coprolite?

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.740
Fossilised dung.
Dung?

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.750
Oh, so this is plant material that was eaten

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.060
Eaten. Turned into poop. Yes.
And then preserved

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.870
so that I could hold it today.
Yes, exactly.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.560
That's a dinosaur poop.
This is dinosaur poop.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.310
Yes. It smells like a rock.
Sometimes when we break open

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.460
somebody's things that are... that have a...

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.360
have a very high concentration plant
material you actually can smell it.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.240
Really? Uhm.
What does it smell like?

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.250
Mmmh, rotting wood.
After this long

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.510
it still has an odour of rotting?
It can, yes.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.320
So, we can probably learn a lot.
We can learn more

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.640
about the dinosaur from that right there
than we can from the bone from its

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.739
body. That is amazing.
Because we can determine,

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.870
we can determine exactly what it was

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.030
eating and and and we can

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.160
look at how it's chopped up, so you can tell a lot about

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.820
exactly how they process the food.
So, from the

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.300
scientific perspective of learning
about dinosaurs, poop

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.160
is not crappy at all.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.020
Yes.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.030
Thanks for laughing at that. 
Now, at any point would that turn into

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.690
oil?
No, oil does not come

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.110
from dinosaur poop.
Does it come from dinosaurs at all?

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.209
It doesn't come from dinosaurs at all.
They come from microorganisms and

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.060
oceans.
If you took all of the dinosaurs that ever lived

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.690
and... and, you know, squished them up

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.900
in order to get the oil out of them,

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.300
we'd probably go through that oil in,
you know, couple of days.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.319
No kidding(!)
I mean the microorganisms from the ocean,

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.489
from the oceans over these millions of years

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.330
produced... I mean, the biomass is just incredible.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.950
Compared to the dinosaurs.
So there could be a tiny

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.099
molecule of oil in every thousand gallons or more

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.410
that's from a dinosaur.
No,  you really not even gonna...

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.970
That's not even going to happen as well.
Basically, all of the oil reserves we have

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.590
are in

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.270
in sedimentary rocks, produced in oceans.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.530
So we don't put dinosaur ghosts into our cars,

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.950
but don't feel lonely.
There are actual living dinosaurs

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.610
with us today. There are dinosaurs still around today.
Dinosaurs

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.370
never went extinct.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.630
What? Elaborate, alright, fine I will.
So, dinosaurs...

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.280
Yeah, that's what I meant.
Dinosaurs are not a species, that was called a clade.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.940
They're from the clade dinosauria.
And the clade is just some

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.940
organism and all of its descendants.
Okay. Okay? Dinosaurs came in all different

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.800
types, right?

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.200
All of these things were called dinosauria

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.300
and then a huge extinction event
happened, 65 million years ago.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.500
Yup.
Giant rock hit Earth and like

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.789
almost all of them, all the ones, died

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.259
except for

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.219
a few. And you know what this one was, 
this little branch? That's what clade means, by the

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.220
way - branch.

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.990
Aardvark. Aardvark. No?
Uhh,

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.760
I do. I know what it was.
What? Halibut.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.820
Just for the halibut I will say

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.219
correct. That's a dumb joke,
that's a joke that's been made a bunch.

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:41.830
I've never heard it before. Really?
You just said "halibut" like

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.779
"hell of it." Yeah. Yeah. Classic.
Now figure this trout.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.900
Wow.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.580
Dude.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.880
The answer is birds.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.800
Technically birds aren't just descended
from dinosaurs, they literally

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.129
are dinosaur. Exactly. You know, 
to determine how things are related to one

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:01.719
another we look at the characteristics
that they share

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:06.779
and when you think about birds and the
characteristics that we think

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:09.990
of as being bird characteristics,
they are feathers,

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.240
hollow bones, the wishbone,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.770
you know, you can go on and on,
but those are just a few of them

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.279
and it turns out dinosaurs have
them as well, so

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:23.509
dinosaurs had these characteristics before birds.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.600
The hypothesis is that birds

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.620
are the dinosaurs.
The meteor impact that killed off the dinosaurs

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.279
didn't kill off all of them.
It killed off then

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:38.509
what we call the non-avian dinosaurs and

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:42.710
the avian dinosaurs we still have with us.
In Jurassic World,

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.819
the park's decision-makers create dinosaurs

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:48.960
that have appearances that bring in

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.189
tourists, not appearances that are
historically accurate.

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:57.189
For example, they didn't put feathers on
any of their dinosaurs, although it is

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:58.999
believed that many dinosaurs

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:00.040
had

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.960
feathers. It's believed that the
velociraptor probably

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.540
actually looked more like this.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.050
And as far as the reality of creating a
park like Jurassic World,

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.170
Horner had this to say.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.000
Everything about it is fictional, we can't bring dinosaurs

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.440
back by cloning them.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.500
If we make dinosaurs, which,

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.410
I hope we are able to do one of these
days, it will be retro engineering from a

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.020
bird,

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.440
in other words going backwards from a bird.
They're still going to be fictional

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.460
creatures because

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.580
they're not going to be historical dinosaurs.
They'll be

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.050
things we made.
They'll be things we make, yeah, that's right.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.780
Why are we so thrilled by the idea of bringing back

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.910
un-extincting non-avian dinosaurs?

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.040
You know what?
That actually brings up an even bigger question.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.590
Why are dinosaurs so fascinating to kids?
Dinosaurs

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:54.700
are terrifying and we love to be scared,

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.020
but Dracula and ghosts

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.820
and all this stuff, 
it's a little, it's a little not real.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.240
But dinosaurs? We've got their fossils.
Right. You know?

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.050
We've got the fact that, no, these really
were on Earth, they really were walking

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:09.950
around right here.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.430
Why is it so awesome when they flip out
and start killing people?

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:17.450
Watching something flip out and kill
people is thrilling.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.860
It's morbid curiosity, but the more intense the

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.460
flip out, the more exciting it is to see the flip

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.270
undone, to see humans prevail

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.650
in the end.
No matter how beastly

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:34.159
and huge dinosaurs were,
the fact remains that they

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:38.159
went extinct.
They are a reminder that

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:42.010
sooner or later the universe will beat

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:45.950
everything.
A meteor impact, like the one that

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.870
killed off all the non-avian dinosaurs
will happen again

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:54.580
in about the next 100 million years or
so, but we might stand a fighting chance.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.890
We have technology and we have the ability to predict,

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.390
and possibly even avoid,
a similar fate involing us.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:06.070
Outer space may seem distant

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:10.230
and sometimes irrelevant to pressing earthly concerns,

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.040
but let's not forget what Larry Niven said,
"The dinosaurs

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.320
went extinct because they didn't have
a space program."

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.600
And as always,

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.820
thanks for watching.
