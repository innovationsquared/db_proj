The robot was answering the--
- Yes.

00:22:33.718 --> 00:22:35.153 align:start size:66% position:34%
- Seriously verbatim.

00:22:35.186 --> 00:22:37.088 align:end position:100%
It's a deep neural network
that learns

00:22:37.121 --> 00:22:38.757
and can synthesize human speech.
- Yes.

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.625 align:start position:0%
- So my new type
is a robot?

00:22:40.658 --> 00:22:43.161 align:start position:0%
I mean, things are changing
in this world, right?

00:22:43.194 --> 00:22:45.163
both: Yeah.
- This will be

00:22:45.196 --> 00:22:47.599 align:end position:100%
not really a joke
in the future.

00:22:47.632 --> 00:22:50.635 align:start position:0%
- That is scary,
actually.

00:22:50.668 --> 00:22:52.971
<i> - The future of A.I.
 might be scary for some,</i>

00:22:53.004 --> 00:22:55.640
<i> but even so,
 this subject wasn't</i>

00:22:55.673 --> 00:22:58.176
<i> the only one
 who chose the computer.</i>

00:22:58.209 --> 00:23:00.779
- Bachelor number two,
I'm gonna choose you.

00:23:00.812 --> 00:23:02.847
- Wow!
Okay, Bachelor number two.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.116
- I think he might be
the weirdo that I'm looking for.

00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:07.118
<i> - Cleverbot managed
 to win the hearts</i>

00:23:07.151 --> 00:23:10.755
<i> of two bachelorettes,
 passing both our Turing test</i>

00:23:10.788 --> 00:23:13.658
<i> and our "date-ability" test.</i>

00:23:13.691 --> 00:23:15.026
- That concludes...
[both laughing]

00:23:15.059 --> 00:23:17.662
"Let's Get...
both: "RomanTech."

00:23:17.695 --> 00:23:18.863
- All right.

00:23:18.896 --> 00:23:21.833
[cheers and applause]

00:23:25.803 --> 00:23:29.474
- Maybe computers will have
rights like humans someday.

00:23:29.507 --> 00:23:32.177
<i> Maybe we'll never know
 what makes human minds</i>

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:34.679
different
from electronic ones.

00:23:34.712 --> 00:23:36.147
Maybe the question isn't,

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.917
"Can we have relationships
with technology,"

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.553
<i> but rather,
 "Are we the same thing?"</i>

00:23:41.586 --> 00:23:45.957
I mean, imagine an alien who has
no concept of the human body

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.626
<i> seeing me
 for the first time.</i>

00:23:48.659 --> 00:23:50.061
Would it understand
the line

00:23:50.094 --> 00:23:53.631
between the organism
and the invention?

00:23:53.664 --> 00:23:57.168
Would it know that these were
made for me by other humans,

00:23:57.201 --> 00:24:00.138
or would it think that
they just grow out of me?

00:24:00.171 --> 00:24:03.007
Would it think
that my phone or my computer

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:08.179
<i> are devices or external
 metal organs I evolved?</i>

00:24:08.212 --> 00:24:12.784
Years from now, will computers
attain personhood

00:24:12.817 --> 00:24:18.523
or are we all collectively
attaining "cyborghood"?

00:24:18.556 --> 00:24:21.526
And as always,
thanks for watching.
