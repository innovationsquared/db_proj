<i> I was introduced

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:35.735 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> in the classic schoolyard
 game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.</i>

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:37.804 align:start position:0%
How long did it take
for them to learn that?

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:40.807 align:start size:56% position:44%
I think it's about
300 sessions.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.176 align:start position:0%
With what,
one session a day?

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.678 line:0%
-We have three sessions a day.
-Ah, okay.

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:48.748 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
-Hundred days. Three months.
-A hundred days' about three
months.

00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:52.752 align:start position:0%
Um, what made you want to do
Rock, Paper, Scissors
in the first place?

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:55.421 align:start size:97% position:3%
[Gao] I'm interested in whether
they could learn

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:57.557 align:start size:81% position:19%
the circular relationship.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.694 align:start size:91% position:9%
And the Rock, Paper, Scissors
game is three elements,

00:01:01.727 --> 00:01:05.231 align:start size:69% position:31% line:0%
so it's the simplest
circular relationship.

00:01:05.264 --> 00:01:06.800 size:88% position:56% line:0%
[Matsuzawa speaking]

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:18.678 align:start position:0% line:0%
[Michael] Rare? Yeah.

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:26.119 line:0%
-And it seems like they do.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.389 align:start position:0%
She's doing
really well at this.

00:01:30.422 --> 00:01:31.657 align:start size:91% position:9%
-Yes.
-Faster than I could do it.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.861 align:start position:0%
Now I haven't trained
for hundreds of trials,

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:39.198 align:start position:0%
but before I can even
figure out which one
I would tap,

00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:41.801
she's already picked correctly.

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:46.372 align:start size:81% position:19%
Yeah, I think they kind of
react quicker than humans.

00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:50.409 align:start size:94% position:6%
Also, in Professor Matsuzawa's
numerical task, they also--

00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:55.281 align:start size:88% position:13%
-They don't wait.
-They do it very quickly.

00:01:55.314 --> 00:01:57.884 align:start size:94% position:6%
-[Gao] The accuracy is 94%.
-[Matsuzawa] 94.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:01:59.919 size:88% position:44%
94 %. That's incredible.

00:01:59.952 --> 00:02:04.223 align:start size:88% position:13%
-It's only three errors.
-Three errors.

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:06.893 align:start size:84% position:16%
-[Matsuzawa] Out of 48.
-[Gao] 48 trials.

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:10.863
So another session
is for human hands.

00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:14.500
This is another variation
of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:17.170 align:start size:75% position:25%
-Yeah. Now these
are human hands.
-Yes.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:20.740 align:start position:0%
And at first, did you notice
a difference in ability

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:22.909 align:start position:0%
to distinguish
the Rock, Paper, Scissors
symbols

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:25.244 align:start position:0%
with a chimp hand
or a human hand?

00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:28.314 align:start size:94% position:6%
[Gao] Well at first,
we trained, a chimpanzee hand.

00:02:28.347 --> 00:02:31.717 align:start size:84% position:16%
After he learn it,
we trained with human hand.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.452 align:start size:78% position:22%
-[buzzer]
-And surprisingly--

00:02:33.485 --> 00:02:35.788 align:start size:94% position:6%
-She got one wrong.
-Yeah. --they didn't  get it,

00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:39.392 align:start size:75% position:25%
because for humans,
it's easy for us to know
that, for example,

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:42.461 align:start size:75% position:25%
the paper--human paper--
and chimpanzee paper,

00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:44.697 size:88% position:56%
-they are in the same shape,
-Right.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.167 align:start size:81% position:19%
but chimpanzees,
they don't seem to get it.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:50.570 size:88% position:56% line:0%
[Matsuzawa speaking]

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:56.709 align:start position:0% line:0%
Yeah.

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:02.548 align:start position:0%
[Michael]
Yeah, and so the next step,
obviously,

00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:05.518 align:start position:0%
is just playing
Rock, Paper, Scissors

00:03:05.551 --> 00:03:07.954 align:start position:0%
- Oh, yes.
-against another chimp
or against me.

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:09.789 align:start size:44% position:56%
Yeah,
that's a plan.

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
Well, do you think
that because Aye has learned
a circular relationship

00:03:14.593 --> 00:03:18.297 align:start position:0%
and has connected a chimp
and a human hand,
kind of abstract category thing,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.435 align:start position:0%
that she's traded off
anything that she used to be
good at and now isn't?

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:24.904
-Good question.
-[Gao] Yeah.

00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:25.972
[both laugh]

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:27.573 align:start size:56% position:44%
[both] Hmm...

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:30.210 align:start size:75% position:25%
-Future research.
-Yes.
