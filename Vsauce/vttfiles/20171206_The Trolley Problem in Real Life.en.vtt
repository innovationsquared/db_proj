00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:15.581
[sneezes] Excuse me.

00:00:15.614 --> 00:00:16.515
You know,
if I had been driving,

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:18.251
that would've been
pretty dangerous.

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:19.485
Every time you sneeze,

00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:21.754
your eyes close
for about one second,

00:00:21.787 --> 00:00:24.624
which means if you sneeze
while driving at, say,

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:28.761
70 miles per hour times 5,280
divided by 60 divided by 60,

00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:33.633
you will travel about 103 feet
with your eyes closed.

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.102
But don't worry.

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:38.071
This is a self-driving car.

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:40.740
It uses sensors and software
to drive itself

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:43.176
to keep me
and other people safe.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:44.777
I hope.

[tires screech]

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.649
Impressive.
But let me ask you a question.

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:51.717
What if an autonomous vehicle
had to make a choice

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.853
between hitting two people
right in front of it

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:56.189
or swerving to avoid them

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:58.791
and hit one person
on a sidewalk?

00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:00.827
What should
it be programmed to do?

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.329
[tires screech, car crashes]

00:01:03.362 --> 00:01:04.864
What would you do?

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:06.833
Now polls and surveys
have been put together

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.601
asking people what they<i> think </i>
they would do,

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:10.870
but no researchers
have ever put people

00:01:10.903 --> 00:01:14.240
in that actual
traumatic experience.

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:17.343
Would we learn more about
human nature if we did that?

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:20.213
Would it even be ethical to put
people in that sort of position?

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:22.748
I'm about to find out.

00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:26.086 line:0%
[theme music playing]

00:01:37.863 --> 00:01:41.501
In 1967, British philosopher
Philippa Foot

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:45.171
created a precursor to our
self-driving car conundrum.

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:47.173
The famous scenario
she came up with

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:49.342
is known as
"the trolley problem."

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:52.678
Imagine there's a runaway train
hurtling down a train track.

00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:54.380
Directly ahead of the train,

00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:57.150
there are five people
on the track.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.685
Now, imagine that you are
too far away

00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:02.822
to help those five people,
but right next to you,

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:07.193
there's a lever that can divert
the train onto another track.

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:10.930
If you divert the train,
the five people will be saved.

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:12.598
But here's the catch.

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:14.834
There's another person
on the second track.

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:17.370
Now you're faced with a dilemma.

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:18.704
You can either do nothing

00:02:18.737 --> 00:02:20.940
and the train
will kill five people,

00:02:20.973 --> 00:02:24.510
or you can pull the lever
and save their lives,

00:02:24.543 --> 00:02:28.915
but be directly responsible
for one person's death.

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:30.816
What would you do?

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.586
When surveyed, most people say
that they'd pull the lever

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.822
and sacrifice one person
to save five.

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:38.925
It's for the greater good.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.661
But how we say we'd act
may not match

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:45.531
how we'd actually act if
the scenario really happened

00:02:45.564 --> 00:02:49.435
with real emotions
and real lives at stake.

00:02:49.468 --> 00:02:52.738
Any difference between the two
would reveal who we<i> are</i>

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:55.875
compared to who we want to be,
but a comparison

00:02:55.908 --> 00:02:59.879
could only be made by doing
what has never been done before:

00:02:59.912 --> 00:03:02.715
making the trolley problem real.

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:16.229
[Michael]<i> Suppose we conducted
 an experiment</i>

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:18.731
<i> in a realistic railroad

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:21.901 line:0%

00:03:27.406 --> 00:03:29.809 line:0%
<i> but the subjects would think
 it was all real.</i>

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:31.844 line:0%
<i> They would believe that
 they could control a lever</i>

00:03:31.877 --> 00:03:33.913 line:0%
<i> that switches the tracks,</i>

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:36.916 line:0%
<i> and they'd have the option
 to divert the train or not.</i>

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:39.986 line:0%
<i> They'd be totally convinced
 that they have to choose</i>

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.922 line:0%
<i> between five lives or one.</i>

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:45.791
But wait,
there's a greater-good dilemma

00:03:45.824 --> 00:03:48.728
about doing an experiment
on the greater good.

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:51.397
By forcing people
to truly believe

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.400
they might kill someone,
are we risking

00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:56.802
serious psychological damage
to them?

00:03:56.835 --> 00:04:00.806
Yes, it might be beneficial to
all of us to see what happens,

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:06.045
but would those benefits be
worth potential trauma to a few?

00:04:06.078 --> 00:04:09.582
To actually conduct
a real-life trolley problem,

00:04:09.615 --> 00:04:12.718
I needed to make sure
it would be ethical.

00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:15.354
<i> So I sat down
 with behavioral neuroscientist</i>

00:04:15.387 --> 00:04:17.556
<i> Professor Aaron Blaisdell.</i>

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.625 align:start position:0%
What you know about
the trolley problem

00:04:19.658 --> 00:04:21.827 align:start position:0% line:0%
and what previous studies
have found?

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.664 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
Most people say
they would pull the switch.

00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:27.533 align:start position:0% line:0%
Sure, it's one life versus five.
The math works out.

00:04:27.566 --> 00:04:30.002 align:start position:0%
But what I want to know
is that if we actually
put them in front

00:04:30.035 --> 00:04:33.506 align:start position:0%
of a switch, watching a train
barreling towards people,

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.008 align:start position:0%
would they actually pull it
in that moment?

00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:39.745 align:start size:59% position:41%
I bet a lot of them
would freeze
in that moment.

00:04:39.778 --> 00:04:41.080 align:start size:59% position:41%
When you're afraid,

00:04:41.113 --> 00:04:43.883 align:start size:72% position:28%
I think that shuts down
a lot of action.

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:45.751
-I'd like to find out.
-Okay.

00:04:45.784 --> 00:04:48.888
What potential harms could come
to someone in that position?

00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:50.389 align:start size:72% position:28%
Most people
would probably be fine,

00:04:50.422 --> 00:04:52.892 align:start size:81% position:19%
but there is
a small potential for harm

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:57.029 align:start size:75% position:25%
in the sense of somebody
being guilt-ridden

00:04:57.062 --> 00:05:00.399 align:start size:78% position:22%
over their decision,
obsessive thoughts about,

00:05:00.432 --> 00:05:02.535 align:start size:81% position:19%
"I'm the person
who would push that button

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:05.071 align:start size:78% position:22%
and cause the train to go
and kill somebody."

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:08.374 align:start size:63% position:38%
Or they might think,
"I'm the person
who would freeze

00:05:08.407 --> 00:05:10.810 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I wouldn't be able
to help those five people,"

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:12.878 size:88% position:56%
and that could be traumatic.

00:05:12.911 --> 00:05:15.681 align:start position:0%
Have we ever tested
the trolley problem

00:05:15.714 --> 00:05:18.551 size:84% position:42%
on human subjects for real?

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:20.419 align:start size:50% position:50%
To my knowledge,
we have not.

00:05:20.452 --> 00:05:22.822 align:start position:0%
Would you want to see
the trolley problem

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:24.090 align:start position:0%
enacted in real life?

00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:26.058 align:start size:56% position:44%
You know, I would.

00:05:26.091 --> 00:05:29.795 align:start size:75% position:25%
That would be
very informative about
how people really react.

00:05:29.828 --> 00:05:32.565 align:start size:91% position:9%
-If I were tell you
we're going to run this...
-Okay.

00:05:32.598 --> 00:05:34.066
...would you feel comfortable

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.102 align:start position:0%
with that responsibility
on your shoulders?

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:39.672 align:start size:66% position:34%
No. I couldn't do it.

00:05:39.705 --> 00:05:41.841 align:start size:72% position:28%
For me
to be involved in that,

00:05:41.874 --> 00:05:45.010 align:start size:91% position:9%
it would have to be on
the shoulders of many people,

00:05:45.043 --> 00:05:46.879 align:start size:81% position:19%
including an ethics board.

00:05:46.912 --> 00:05:48.647 align:start size:66% position:34%
I couldn't just
go through with that.

the ways to make it pass

00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:27.880
is we should probably
be screening out for people

00:07:27.913 --> 00:07:30.182

you know, any kind of,
like, clinical problem

that could make them
more vulnerable

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:42.828
I actually think
that under those circumstances,

00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:44.730
-it might pass.
-Can you present

00:07:44.763 --> 00:07:47.533
a compelling case as to
the social good of this study?

00:07:47.566 --> 00:07:49.134
-I agree.
-If you could find a way

00:07:49.167 --> 00:07:50.769
to say, "Look,
this is why it's important.

00:07:50.802 --> 00:07:52.805
It's not just basic
theoretical research.

00:07:52.838 --> 00:07:56.208

00:07:56.241 --> 00:07:59.044
direct implications

00:07:59.077 --> 00:08:00.679
It's a risk-benefit,

are potentially tremendous."

00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:07.286 align:start size:66% position:34%
Right, and so my hope
is that the good
this experiment does

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:12.291 align:start size:50% position:50%
is in revealing
the difference
between instinct

and philosophical reflection,

00:08:16.094 --> 00:08:19.098 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I think that there
could be an enormous benefit

00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:21.867 size:84% position:58%
in learning the difference
so that we can train people

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.904 align:start size:81% position:19%
to act in the way
that they wish they would.

00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:26.872
-[David] Yeah.
-[Natasha] That's interesting.

00:08:26.905 --> 00:08:29.542
-That's a compelling argument.
-[Natasha] Yeah.

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:33.279
I came into this meeting
expecting a lot of resistance,

00:08:33.312 --> 00:08:36.582
but, instead, I'm actually
leaving invigorated,

00:08:36.615 --> 00:08:38.984
like, excited to take
their concerns,

00:08:39.017 --> 00:08:40.719
implement them into the study,

00:08:40.752 --> 00:08:42.888
and make it not just
more acceptable,

00:08:42.921 --> 00:08:44.223
which I thought
was the purpose here,

00:08:44.256 --> 00:08:46.625
but to actually make it
more beneficial,

00:08:46.658 --> 00:08:49.995
more fascinating,
and penetrate deeper

00:08:50.028 --> 00:08:51.898
and have more applications
in society.

00:08:57.069 --> 00:09:00.606
So I decided we were ready
to move forward,

00:09:00.639 --> 00:09:02.007 line:0%
to turn one
of the most notorious

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.111 line:0%
hypothetical ethical dilemmas
into a reality.

00:09:06.144 --> 00:09:10.182
[train horn blowing]

00:09:10.215 --> 00:09:12.217
<i> We traveled
 to an abandoned railroad line</i>

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.053
<i> and hired a freight train.</i>

00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:17.156
<i> Our subjects needed to be shown
 how switch points work.</i>

00:09:17.189 --> 00:09:19.191
<i> So the "Mind Field"
 production team</i>

00:09:19.224 --> 00:09:22.094
<i> shot a video of a train
 going down two tracks.</i>

00:09:22.127 --> 00:09:26.231
<i> Then we dressed six actors
 like railroad workers.</i>

00:09:26.264 --> 00:09:28.334
<i> Since we didn't want them
 to be at actual risks of harm,</i>

00:09:28.367 --> 00:09:30.035
<i> we took steps to make sure
 they were safe.</i>

00:09:30.068 --> 00:09:32.805 align:start size:69% position:31% line:0%
You're all going to be
workers on the track.

00:09:32.838 --> 00:09:34.873
We will not have
the train moving

00:09:34.906 --> 00:09:36.642
while you are on the tracks.

00:09:36.675 --> 00:09:39.144
[Michael]<i> We filmed
 our actors on the tracks,</i>

00:09:39.177 --> 00:09:40.980
<i> wearing ear protection
 and looking distracted</i>

00:09:41.013 --> 00:09:42.181
<i> to explain
 why they couldn't hear</i>

00:09:42.214 --> 00:09:43.916
<i> a train coming toward them.</i>

00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:47.119
<i> Then in editing,
 we employed visual effects</i>

00:09:47.152 --> 00:09:49.888
<i> to create the illusion
 of the train approaching.</i>

00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:51.957
<i> We then combined
 the shots together.</i>

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.159
<i> During the experiment,
 we would play the video</i>

00:09:54.192 --> 00:09:55.828
<i> for our subjects,
 who would believe</i>

00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:57.696
<i> the action was happening live</i>

00:09:57.729 --> 00:09:59.799
<i> and transmitted
 from remote cameras.</i>

00:10:02.234 --> 00:10:04.303
<i> Our next step
 was to find an expert</i>

00:10:04.336 --> 00:10:06.305
<i> who would be willing to guide
 me through the process</i>

00:10:06.338 --> 00:10:08.107
<i> of selecting our subjects,</i>

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.143
<i> in order to minimize
 psychological harm.</i>

00:10:11.176 --> 00:10:13.078 align:start position:0%
So what should I be
worried about?

00:10:13.111 --> 00:10:16.649 align:start size:94% position:6%
The worst would probably be
posttraumatic stress disorder,

00:10:16.682 --> 00:10:19.318 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
and that's when
they're going to be
re-experiencing the trauma.

00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:21.687 align:start size:72% position:28% line:0%
They'll keep thinking
about it over and over,

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.190 size:84% position:58%
and so to limit risk, you'd
want to screen out people

00:10:25.223 --> 00:10:27.326 align:start size:66% position:34%
prone to
a traumatic reaction,

00:10:27.359 --> 00:10:29.662 align:start size:63% position:38%
and then afterwards,
do the debrief.

00:10:29.695 --> 00:10:32.398 align:start size:47% position:53%
That's the key
to limit harm
from happening.

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:33.866 align:start size:63% position:38%
How are they feeling
at this moment?

00:10:33.899 --> 00:10:35.367 align:start size:81% position:19%
What's going on with them?

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.403 align:start size:81% position:19%
You can start to ease them
into the reality

00:10:37.436 --> 00:10:40.272 align:start size:63% position:38%
of what is
instead of what they
thought it was.

00:10:40.305 --> 00:10:43.676 align:start position:0%
Would you be willing to help us
conduct this experiment?

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:45.711 align:start size:28% position:72%
Oh, uh...

00:10:45.744 --> 00:10:47.713 align:start size:50% position:50%
yes, I mean,
I think I would.

00:10:47.746 --> 00:10:49.214 align:start size:63% position:38%
I think this is
a really fascinating

00:10:49.247 --> 00:10:52.317 align:start size:75% position:25%
and valuable experiment,
because people can have

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:56.055
very uncomfortable lessons that
they then start to learn from.

00:10:56.088 --> 00:10:59.024 align:start size:69% position:31%
If I can make sure
that we get people
who may be appropriate

00:10:59.057 --> 00:11:01.227 align:start size:59% position:41%
to do such a thing,
I would be honored.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.103
[woman] I'm calling regarding
a study we're doing

00:11:11.136 --> 00:11:12.471 line:0%
for high-speed railway.

00:11:12.504 --> 00:11:13.472 line:0%
I wanted to know if you
might be interested

00:11:13.505 --> 00:11:15.774 line:0%
in participating next week.

00:11:15.807 --> 00:11:18.744
[Michael]
<i> To disguise the true nature
 of our experiment,</i>

00:11:18.777 --> 00:11:21.080
<i> we placed an online ad
 recruiting people</i>

00:11:21.113 --> 00:11:23.382
<i> for a fake focus group
 to offer feedback</i>

00:11:23.415 --> 00:11:26.051
<i> on California's
 new high-speed rail.</i>

00:11:26.084 --> 00:11:29.288
Today I'm just going to ask you
to fill out a couple forms

00:11:29.321 --> 00:11:32.825
to make sure that there's
a range of personality types

00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:36.195
in our group
and for TSA security purposes.

00:11:36.228 --> 00:11:37.963
[Michael]
<i> These psychological surveys,</i>

00:11:37.996 --> 00:11:39.498
<i> used frequently by employers,</i>

00:11:39.531 --> 00:11:42.101
<i> look to uncover signs
 of depression, anxiety,</i>

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:44.036
<i> and other conditions
 that might make someone</i>

00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:46.772
<i> unsuitable to participate
 in this experiment.</i>

00:11:46.805 --> 00:11:48.340 align:start size:63% position:38%
Thank you very much.
Have a great day.

00:11:48.373 --> 00:11:50.209 align:start position:0%
Thank<i> you.</i>

00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:52.444
<i> Back in Dr. Cason's office,</i>

00:11:52.477 --> 00:11:54.880
<i> we reviewed the potential
 subjects' responses.</i>

00:11:54.913 --> 00:11:58.517 align:start size:84% position:16%
This particular person,
I was concerned about this.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:02.755 align:start size:88% position:13%
Some high suicidal thinking,
high acting out.

00:12:02.788 --> 00:12:05.424 align:start size:72% position:28%
Those kinds
of factors might not be
good in an experiment

00:12:05.457 --> 00:12:07.259 align:start position:0%
where you want
to try to prevent

00:12:07.292 --> 00:12:09.328 align:start size:81% position:19%
-some of the trauma
from happening.
-Right.

00:12:09.361 --> 00:12:10.863 align:start position:0%
These people, though,

00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:12.364 align:start position:0%
and there's
a large group of them,

00:12:12.397 --> 00:12:14.466 size:75% position:38%
they are more resilient.

00:12:14.499 --> 00:12:18.170 align:start position:0%
So I would be more comfortable
with these people,

00:12:18.203 --> 00:12:19.872 align:start size:66% position:34%
because their ability
to bounce back

00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:22.174 align:start size:72% position:28%
in difficult situations
might make them

00:12:22.207 --> 00:12:24.042 align:start size:50% position:50%
less susceptible
to a trauma.

00:12:24.075 --> 00:12:27.446
[Michael]<i> Finally, after
 consulting two psychologists</i>

00:12:27.479 --> 00:12:29.314
<i> and a university ethics board,</i>

00:12:29.347 --> 00:12:32.284
<i> it was time to put our plan
 into action.</i>

00:12:46.464 --> 00:12:48.834
[Michael] This is where we're
going to physically create

00:12:48.867 --> 00:12:50.836
the trolley problem
in real life,

00:12:50.869 --> 00:12:53.305
not with a trolley,
but with a train.

00:12:53.338 --> 00:12:55.307 line:0%
Our subjects will sign in
at this booth

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:56.542 size:78% position:39% line:0%
for our phony focus test,

00:12:56.575 --> 00:12:58.577
which will never
actually take place.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:00.445
It's going to be
a hot day for them.

00:13:00.478 --> 00:13:02.214
So we'll offer them,
while they wait

00:13:02.247 --> 00:13:05.417
for the actual test to begin,
the chance to sit inside

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.920
this nice air-conditioned
remote switching station.

00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:11.824
Inside, they'll meet a kindly
train-switch operator,

00:13:11.857 --> 00:13:13.192
supposedly an employee

00:13:13.225 --> 00:13:15.327
of the California
Railroad Authority.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.496
The California Railroad
Authority is real.

00:13:17.529 --> 00:13:19.331
Real fake.

00:13:19.364 --> 00:13:22.568
<i> We invented this nonexistent
 government organization</i>

00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:26.538
<i> to convince our subjects
 that everything here is real,</i>

00:13:26.571 --> 00:13:30.242
<i> including these monitors
 showing supposedly live shots</i>

00:13:30.275 --> 00:13:32.544
of actual trains
from different tracks

00:13:32.577 --> 00:13:34.346
all around the California area.

00:13:38.617 --> 00:13:40.853
While the participant
is waiting inside this room,

00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:42.855
<i> they'll learn how the operator
 switches the tracks</i>

00:13:42.888 --> 00:13:44.957
<i> using a lever to remotely
 switch a train</i>

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.158
<i> from one track to another.</i>

00:13:46.191 --> 00:13:47.593
<i> They'll see it happen.</i>

00:13:47.626 --> 00:13:49.895
We're actually controlling
the video

00:13:49.928 --> 00:13:52.631
on these screens from
a different hidden control room.

00:13:52.664 --> 00:13:54.900
<i> At a given time,
 the switch operator</i>

00:13:54.933 --> 00:13:57.603
<i> will leave the subject alone
 in the switching station.</i>

00:13:57.636 --> 00:14:00.406
And at that point,
a crisis will occur.

00:14:02.274 --> 00:14:04.143
-[brakes hiss]
-[horn blows]

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.113
A train will be barreling
down the tracks,

<i> and workers will have made
 their way out to both tracks,</i>

00:14:10.148 --> 00:14:13.853
<i> five on one, one worker
 on his phone on the other.</i>

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.189

who has any kind of control
or authority.

00:14:19.491 --> 00:14:22.160
<i> Switching the train is up
 to the subject alone.</i>

00:14:22.193 --> 00:14:25.097
<i> They'll feel like what they do
 has real-world consequences.</i>

so it's time for me
to get ready.

00:14:42.981 --> 00:14:44.483
Dr. Cason,
how are you feeling?

00:14:44.516 --> 00:14:46.485
-Good.
-My hypothesis

00:14:46.518 --> 00:14:49.488 align:start position:0%
is that we're going see
people immediately,

00:14:49.521 --> 00:14:51.089 align:start position:0%
when they hear
that first warning,

00:14:51.122 --> 00:14:53.558 align:start position:0%
leave the station and not want
to get back inside.

00:14:53.591 --> 00:14:56.128 align:start size:63% position:38%
The other option
would be, of course,
the freeze action,

00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:57.696 align:start size:72% position:28%
where
they don't do anything,

00:14:57.729 --> 00:14:59.665 align:start size:69% position:31%
'cause they don't know
what to do.

00:14:59.698 --> 00:15:02.100 align:start size:69% position:31%
In that case,
we want to know
their thought process.

00:15:02.133 --> 00:15:05.170 align:start size:69% position:31%
It'll be interesting
to see. This has never
been done before.

00:16:10.635 --> 00:16:11.703 align:start size:16% position:84%

So, actually,
this isn't part of it.

00:16:22.447 --> 00:16:24.583 align:start position:0%
This is a remote

00:16:24.616 --> 00:16:26.618 align:start size:72% position:28%

a little bit,

nice and cool and

00:16:32.424 --> 00:16:34.159

00:16:34.192 --> 00:16:35.461 align:start size:84% position:16%

Eddie, this is Elsa.

00:16:41.099 --> 00:16:43.502

Good, come on in,

00:16:46.137 --> 00:16:48.340

00:16:48.373 --> 00:16:50.475 align:start size:63% position:38%
Um, the focus group.
[laughs]

00:16:50.508 --> 00:16:52.210 align:start position:0%

00:16:52.243 --> 00:16:55.480 align:start size:91% position:9%
Yes, the high-speed railroad.
The luxury railroad.

00:16:55.513 --> 00:16:59.251

These are all live feeds.

00:17:01.219 --> 00:17:05.057 align:start position:0%
What's happening is there's
a lot of construction going on.

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:07.292

00:17:09.327 --> 00:17:11.363

00:17:29.547 --> 00:17:32.150 align:start position:0%
And so there needs to be someone
in here all the time.

00:17:32.183 --> 00:17:33.819 align:start position:0%
Now, the other thing
about this--

00:17:33.852 --> 00:17:36.421

<i> Attention, train approaching.</i>

00:17:36.454 --> 00:17:39.858 align:start position:0%

00:17:39.891 --> 00:17:43.161 align:start size:88% position:13%
-Uh-huh.
-We're gonna divert it
to track two.

00:17:43.194 --> 00:17:44.629 size:81% position:41%
Okay, so a train's coming.

00:17:44.662 --> 00:17:45.730 align:start position:0%

00:17:45.763 --> 00:17:47.332 align:start size:44% position:56%
Ah, very good.

00:17:47.365 --> 00:17:49.334 align:start position:0%
In fact, why don't you be
the one to do that?

00:17:49.367 --> 00:17:51.169 align:start position:0%
Just go ahead
and throw it yourself.

00:17:51.202 --> 00:17:53.138
-Pull it down.
-Right now?

00:17:53.171 --> 00:17:55.774 align:start position:0%
Yeah, go ahead. Good.

00:17:55.807 --> 00:17:58.343 align:start position:0%
It's going much faster
than you think.

00:17:58.376 --> 00:18:02.848 align:start position:0%
All right, it's gonna
make the transition
to track number two.

00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:06.785 align:start position:0%
Well, I tell you what.
You're now a switchman.

[both laugh]

00:18:08.887 --> 00:18:11.756 align:start position:0%
Okay, well,
now that the trailing car

00:18:11.789 --> 00:18:13.592
is clear of the switch points,

00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:15.794 align:start position:0%
go ahead and switch it back
to track one.

00:18:15.827 --> 00:18:18.463
-Okay.
-That was kind of scary.

00:18:18.496 --> 00:18:20.465 align:start size:75% position:25%
I was like, oh, my gosh,
I have to turn it.

00:18:20.498 --> 00:18:22.367 align:start position:0%
Well, just you wait.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.870 align:start position:0%
The good thing is we've got it
back on line one,

00:18:24.903 --> 00:18:27.606 align:start position:0%
and that means
that the next train
that comes through

00:18:27.639 --> 00:18:29.241

00:24:30.535 --> 00:24:31.703
[Michael] Hello, J.R.

00:24:31.736 --> 00:24:33.505
Oh, my gosh!
How you guys doing?

00:24:33.538 --> 00:24:35.240 align:start size:81% position:19%
-My name's Michael.
-J.R.

00:24:35.273 --> 00:24:37.675
Everything that just happened
was an experiment.

00:24:37.708 --> 00:24:40.545
[laughs]

00:24:40.578 --> 00:24:41.713
This was an experiment.

00:24:41.746 --> 00:24:43.848
-Oh, my gosh.
-Okay.

00:24:43.881 --> 00:24:46.050
What were you feeling
when you were watching that?

00:24:46.083 --> 00:24:48.186
Terrified! I-- I just--

00:24:48.219 --> 00:24:49.854
I was feeling
a little anxious
when I saw

00:24:49.887 --> 00:24:51.956
the train coming,
like, "Oh, my God!"

00:24:51.989 --> 00:24:54.192
-Your heart is beating fast?
-Yeah, a little bit, yeah.

00:24:54.225 --> 00:24:55.927
Tell me what was going
through your mind when you heard

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.729
that first warning
that a train was approaching?

00:24:57.762 --> 00:24:59.864 align:start size:59% position:41%
I thought
about switching it,

00:24:59.897 --> 00:25:02.267 align:start size:69% position:31%
but then
actually acting on it
was a different thing.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:06.137
I kind of suspended
my responsibility.

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:08.039
Like, I didn't
know what to do,
so I was just like,

00:25:08.072 --> 00:25:10.041
"Oh, I better not
touch it you know,
because I don't know

00:25:10.074 --> 00:25:11.576
if I'll
screw something up."

00:25:11.609 --> 00:25:13.778
I would assume
that there would be--

00:25:13.811 --> 00:25:16.748 align:start size:91% position:9%
out of those five guys,
someone would've looked back.

00:25:16.781 --> 00:25:18.616
They were gonna get
out of the way,

00:25:18.649 --> 00:25:20.218
of the train was already
planning to stop.

00:25:20.251 --> 00:25:21.753
I think they probably built
those trains

00:25:21.786 --> 00:25:23.588
with some type of sensor
or something like that.

00:25:23.621 --> 00:25:25.723
[Michael]<i> "The train
 probably had sensors."</i>

00:25:25.756 --> 00:25:27.692
<i> "The workers would've noticed."</i>

00:25:27.725 --> 00:25:29.961 line:0%

 the equipment."</i>

<i> are either responsible
 for taking action</i>

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.902
<i> or have already done so.</i>

00:25:37.935 --> 00:25:39.904 align:start size:81% position:19%
-Both tracks
had people on them.
-Right!

00:25:39.937 --> 00:25:42.874
And I just didn't know who
should live and who should die.

00:25:42.907 --> 00:25:44.209
Do I switch it,
do I not switch it?

00:25:44.242 --> 00:25:46.611
I mean, either way,
someone's gonna get
really badly hurt.

00:25:46.644 --> 00:25:47.845
I didn't want that power.

00:25:47.878 --> 00:25:51.349 align:start size:88% position:13%
It was quite--
quite the test, I would say.

00:25:51.382 --> 00:25:52.917
[Michael]
<i> It is quite the test.</i>

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:54.819
<i> At this point,
 one subject</i>

00:25:54.852 --> 00:25:57.188

00:26:04.295 --> 00:26:05.830
This is cool.

00:26:05.863 --> 00:26:07.632
This whole module
will interconnect

00:26:07.665 --> 00:26:10.735
with the entire nation
if we wanted it to.

00:26:10.768 --> 00:26:13.705 line:0%

-Hello?
-Hi, Cory, my name's Michael.

00:27:59.744 --> 00:28:03.381
There was just a--
almost an accident
seemingly.

00:28:03.414 --> 00:28:06.384 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Cory, everything that just
happened was an experiment.
-Okay.

00:28:06.417 --> 00:28:08.086
-No one was in danger.
-For sure.

00:28:08.119 --> 00:28:10.722
These were just loops
of video taken before.

00:28:10.755 --> 00:28:14.058
This is a psychology experiment
looking at how people behave...

00:28:14.091 --> 00:28:17.061
-Okay. Okay, yeah.
-...in various circumstances.

00:28:17.094 --> 00:28:18.896
So tell me
how you were feeling.

00:28:18.929 --> 00:28:22.433
-Mainly a bunch of terror.
-[Greg] Terror.

00:28:22.466 --> 00:28:26.504
And responsibility,
because I was at the helm.

00:28:26.537 --> 00:28:30.875
And just horrified
about making a decision

00:28:30.908 --> 00:28:34.145 align:start size:88% position:13%
between, like,
five people compared to one.

00:28:34.178 --> 00:28:38.015
It was very scary,
to say the least.

00:28:38.048 --> 00:28:39.751
-It was scary, right.
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

00:28:39.784 --> 00:28:41.753
What was going through
your mind

00:28:41.786 --> 00:28:43.755
as the train's coming
down the track?

00:28:43.788 --> 00:28:48.025
It was mainly to warn them.

00:28:48.058 --> 00:28:49.761
There are--
just to reiterate--

00:28:49.794 --> 00:28:51.996
What's coming up?
What's coming up right now?

00:28:52.029 --> 00:28:55.099
You don't want to have
to choose between people.

00:28:55.132 --> 00:28:56.501
Right.

00:28:56.534 --> 00:28:59.804
And that was really tough.

00:28:59.837 --> 00:29:02.440
Either like six families
or one family?

00:29:02.473 --> 00:29:08.780
It was, like... up to me,
it felt like. Yeah.

00:29:08.813 --> 00:29:13.017
It was interesting to me that
you had such presence of mind.

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:15.486
[Michael] Yeah, look for help
<i> and</i> make a decision.

00:29:15.519 --> 00:29:19.524
The one that everyone,
if you ask them in a survey,

00:29:19.557 --> 00:29:21.793
says that they would like
to be brave enough to make.

00:29:21.826 --> 00:29:25.029
Yes, so that was impressive,
Cory, it really was.

00:29:25.062 --> 00:29:26.397
Thank you.

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:29.801
You know, I think it would
be good to have you meet

00:29:29.834 --> 00:29:33.070
-some of the people who
participated so you can see.
-Awesome.

00:29:33.103 --> 00:29:35.473
Yeah, let's go do that,
just follow us on out

00:29:35.506 --> 00:29:37.509
-and meet the actors.
-Awesome.

00:29:41.612 --> 00:29:43.581
[Michael]<i> Cory showed us
 just how important</i>

00:29:43.614 --> 00:29:45.950
<i> the debrief was
 in this situation.</i>

00:29:45.983 --> 00:29:48.419
<i> Meeting the actors,
 which all of our subjects did,</i>

00:29:48.452 --> 00:29:51.189
<i> reinforced that this
 was not a reality.</i>

00:29:54.291 --> 00:29:56.961
So, Greg, trolley problem.

00:29:56.994 --> 00:29:59.063
-Mm-hmm.
-I went into this thinking

00:29:59.096 --> 00:30:02.233
we're going to tease out
some general truths
about human nature.

00:30:02.266 --> 00:30:04.202
However,
what we've really seen

00:30:04.235 --> 00:30:07.405
is that you learn
a lot about the individual.

00:30:07.438 --> 00:30:11.175
-Right.
-Everyone had some explanation
for their behavior.

00:30:11.208 --> 00:30:12.910
-Yes.
-Each one was different.

00:30:12.943 --> 00:30:15.847
Yes, each one person told
themselves a story

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.515
about what was happening
according to the facts

00:30:17.548 --> 00:30:19.350
and their analysis
of the surroundings

00:30:19.383 --> 00:30:21.886
and what was going on
at the moment,

00:30:21.919 --> 00:30:24.255
but it's also based
on their own background
and experience.

00:30:24.288 --> 00:30:27.191
Totally, there were people
who were just frozen,

00:30:27.224 --> 00:30:29.527
<i> realizing something was wrong
 and they weren't prepared.</i>

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.529
 [Greg]<i> J.R. was
 a great example of that.</i>

00:30:31.562 --> 00:30:35.099
He evaluated everything,
but at some point just said,

00:30:35.132 --> 00:30:37.201
"You know,
I don't know what to do."

00:30:37.234 --> 00:30:40.938
Other people
were ready to say,
"You know what?

00:30:40.971 --> 00:30:43.007
<i> This isn't on me.
 It's on the technology.</i>

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.176
<i> I'm sure it's being taken care
 of by others."</i>

00:30:45.209 --> 00:30:47.211
<i> Whereas someone like Cory,</i>

00:30:47.244 --> 00:30:49.113
<i> -someone like Elsa said...</i>
 -[switch clicks]

00:30:49.146 --> 00:30:51.482
<i> -..."No, I have
  to take control."</i>
 -[click]

00:30:51.515 --> 00:30:53.618
They still had some of
those same thoughts,

00:30:53.651 --> 00:30:55.887
but I think what happened
is they realized

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.256
that if they did not
do something,

00:30:58.289 --> 00:30:59.991
more people would be hurt.

00:31:00.024 --> 00:31:02.593
Neither of them
really<i> wanted </i>
to do something.

00:31:02.626 --> 00:31:05.296
They both felt compelled
to do something,

00:31:05.329 --> 00:31:07.098
'cause they
had to save lives.

00:31:07.131 --> 00:31:10.101
<i> So was it worth doing
 the trolley experiment?</i>

00:31:10.134 --> 00:31:11.903
<i> I think it was
 definitely worth it.</i>

00:31:11.936 --> 00:31:13.671
<i> Some of these participants,
 if not all of them,</i>

00:31:13.704 --> 00:31:16.007
<i> learned something
 about human behavior.</i>

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.575
<i> Although it was
 a difficult experience,</i>

00:31:17.608 --> 00:31:20.945
<i> Elsa learned what
 inner strength she had,</i>

00:31:20.978 --> 00:31:22.680
<i> and I think we had saw that
 with Cory as well.</i>

00:31:22.713 --> 00:31:25.516
Every single one of
our participants felt like

00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:27.551
-they just contributed
to something.
-Right.

00:31:27.584 --> 00:31:29.620
And they feel the value
of what just happened.

00:31:29.653 --> 00:31:31.689
-Yeah.
-It's not just us.

00:31:31.722 --> 00:31:33.124 align:start size:91% position:9%
Wow.

00:31:38.028 --> 00:31:40.464
We've since followed up
with our subjects,

00:31:40.497 --> 00:31:42.300
and all of them are doing well.

00:31:42.333 --> 00:31:44.535
I'm glad we minimized risk

00:31:44.568 --> 00:31:46.637
by prescreening
vulnerable individuals,

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:50.241
debriefing the participants,
and providing on-site counseling

00:31:50.274 --> 00:31:52.510
because doing so
gave me confidence

00:31:52.543 --> 00:31:56.547
that we could explore this facet
of human psychology ethically.

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:59.417
We learned that there's
a stark difference

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:01.585
between what people
think they would do

00:32:01.618 --> 00:32:03.688
and what they actually do
when faced

00:32:03.721 --> 00:32:05.623
with a difficult moral dilemma.

00:32:05.656 --> 00:32:08.025
Instead of saving five lives,

00:32:08.058 --> 00:32:11.228
most of our participants
did nothing,

00:32:11.261 --> 00:32:14.131
but is it wrong to freeze?

00:32:14.164 --> 00:32:17.635
Should people feel bad
for being unable to act?

00:32:17.668 --> 00:32:19.737
Well, here's the thing.

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:22.974
Freezing in the face of a threat
is a behavior

00:32:23.007 --> 00:32:25.643
that can be found
all over the animal kingdom,

00:32:25.676 --> 00:32:30.748
but we are the only animals
that can study how we act,

00:32:30.781 --> 00:32:33.617
pontificate
on how we<i> ought</i> to act,

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:37.355
and program machines
to do only that.

00:32:37.388 --> 00:32:40.257
To make progress
in our study of the mind,

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:42.660
we have to affect the mind,

00:32:42.693 --> 00:32:45.262
and that's not something
that we should take lightly.

00:32:45.295 --> 00:32:47.999
Understanding who we are
by taking ourselves

00:32:48.032 --> 00:32:51.435
to the limit comes with a risk,
and as we've learned,

00:32:51.468 --> 00:32:53.771
that risk
must always be balanced

00:32:53.804 --> 00:32:56.173
against the greater good.

00:32:56.206 --> 00:32:58.710
And as always,
thanks for watching.
