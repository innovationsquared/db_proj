Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.240
And I'm with Destin in Alabama.
What he's about to do is capture on a Phantom

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:17.050
camera at a 1080 frames a second a hawk - that
one - catching a target.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.960
But today we're going to talk about sound.
First things first.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.820
The Raptor Center takes care of raptors that
have been injured, or would otherwise not

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.180
be able to survive in the wild on their own.
For instance, this bald eagle named Spirit,

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.760
who was hit by a car that damaged his beak.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.320
Okay, so that is the bald eagle.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.520
Very interesting sound that it makes.
But what I'm interested in today is the recording

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.199
of sound.
It hasn't really been that long in human's

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:53.210
history that we've able to record sounds.
In fact, it wasn't until 1859 with the invention

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.590
of the phonautograph in Paris that we first
recorded sound.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.470
It really blows your mind to listen to this.
What you're about to hear is the very first

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.250
recording ever of any kind of sound.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.840
One thing I found fascinating was that these

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.670
large birds have such high metabolisms that
in order to figure out if they're hungry or

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.520
not all you have to do is weigh them.
And if a bird weighs too much it means it's

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.610
not hungry and so they won't bring it out
to fly, 'cause it might not come back.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.490
It's not hungry, it's not gonna obey commands
to get little bits of food.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.410
But let's now time travel to 1860 and listen
to the very earliest recording of the human

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.799
voice.
What you're about to hear is the voice of

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.739
the inventor of the phonautograph signing
a French folk song.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.340
Three years after that recording Abraham Lincoln
delivered The Gettysburg Address and three

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.450
hours before he gave the speech this photo
was taken.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.030
The only known photo of Lincoln at the historic
event.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.400
It dedicated a cemetery in Pennsylvania to
the Battle of Gettysburg, the deadliest battle

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.860
of America Civil War, where more than 23,000 men died.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.700
Now in attendance was a 9 year old boy named
William V. Rathvon.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.120
And in 1938, as he neared the end of his life,
Rathvon took a copy of the speech and recorded

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.820
himself delivering it as he remembered Lincoln
speaking it.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.200
We don't have any audio of Lincoln delivering
the speech, which makes this recording the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.420
only one done by an eyewitness of the event.
Pretty mind-blowing.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.400
But what about sounds we don't wanna hear?
For instance, fingernails scratching against

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.780
a blackboard.
Well there are a lot of theories about why

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.320
that sound affects us so viscerally and so
immediately.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.720
Some of them argue that the sound of the scratching
may mimic an early warning cry of early humans.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.280
But more recent research suggests that it's
actually certain frequencies inside that scratching

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.860
sound, specifically those between 2000 and
4000 Hz.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.360
A range similar to the human voice.
Our ear canals actually amplify those frequencies,

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.320
so that we can hear them better, but when
it comes to the scratching of things on a

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.620
chalkboard, or styrofoam against styrofoam,
those frequencies become too loud, making

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.280
it painful.
Okay, now let's leave Earth and listen to

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.310
sounds from outer space.
Now, I know what you're thinking, sound in

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.420
outer space is impossible.
Sound waves need a medium to travel through

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.120
and in space you practically have a vacuum.
I know.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.079
But here's something really neat.
The radio antenna on Voyager I was broadcasting

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:04.759
the signal back to Earth as Voyager passed
through the rings of Saturn.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.680
What you're about to listen to is that broadcast,
and all the static and pings you hear are

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.520
actual pieces of Saturn's rings hitting the
radio antenna.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.340
But would outer space really be silent if
I were to walk right out of a space craft

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.919
into it?
I mean, I wouldn't survive very long, because

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.910
of a lack of air, a lack of air pressure,
freezing temperatures, radiation, it would

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.880
be really terrible.
But even though sound waves could not travel

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.000
through space itself, there is a medium that
the sound can travel through.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.580
My body.
That's right.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.660
As my blood boiled and my body inflated, it
would vibrate my bones, it would vibrate my

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.720
body and in turn vibrate my ear drum, which
is something that we experience every day

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.410
if you own a Justin Bieber singing toothbrush.
Special toothbrushes like these vibrate in

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.069
a way that you can barely hear, but as soon
as you bite down on it the vibrations go through

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:15.370
your jaw and jiggle your eardrum and you hear
a quite high fidelity version of Justin Bieber's

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.039
"Baby" or "You Smile," which is fun.
But what this really means is that in space

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:27.959
no one can hear you scream.
But you can hear yourself inflate.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.440
Okay, as you guys know, I'm in Alabama with
Destin from SmarterEveryDay.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.419
Now, even though I grew up in Kansas, I've
never, in my entire life, fired a gun.

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.219
Well, Destin is a ballistics expert, he's
one of the smartest guys I've ever met.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.700
And tonight he's gonna let me fire a gun for
the first time in my life.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.539
This is a 9mm bullet, quite common.
This is not gonna be the first thing I shoot

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:56.270
in my life.
This is.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.360
A 50 caliber bullet, Destin says it's a good
idea, and that I'll be okay because I have

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.360
a beard.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.520
And as always,

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.020
thanks for watching.
