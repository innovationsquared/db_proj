00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.260
Hey, Vsauce Michael here, and
today we are going to talk about farts.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:11.142
What are they, how do they define us,
and how much weight do we lose

00:00:11.142 --> 00:00:12.981
every time we fart?

00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:16.059
Now, it's easy to think that talking about farts is immature,

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.111
but they are incredibly complicated,

00:00:18.111 --> 00:00:22.733
and by analyzing them because they're funny,
you could accidentally learn a lot of science.

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.866
Plus, we are in great company.

00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:28.534
Mozart wrote songs and poems about flatulence,

00:00:28.534 --> 00:00:32.699
and even Benjamin Franklin once wrote
an essay titled, "Fart Proudly."

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.879
So first things first, where do farts come from?

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.540
A lot of the gas that makes up a fart

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.543
comes from the outside, because you swallowed it.

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:46.342
That's right, you swallow a lot of air when
swallowing spit or food or beverage.

00:00:46.342 --> 00:00:48.882
Now, some of this will come back up as a burp,

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.513
but if it doesn't soon enough, it will go deeper

00:00:51.513 --> 00:00:53.849
into your digestive system.

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:58.726
But it's where the other portion of the gas that makes up a fart comes from that makes farts so unique.

00:00:58.726 --> 00:01:01.682
No two people's farts smell alike.

00:01:01.682 --> 00:01:05.237
The pungent part of a fart is unique to you,

00:01:05.237 --> 00:01:07.950
and it comes from things that are inside you

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.408
and are not you.

00:01:10.408 --> 00:01:14.583
Inside your intestines are completely separate organisms,

00:01:14.583 --> 00:01:18.962
bacteria and microbes that digest food you haven't or can't.

00:01:18.962 --> 00:01:22.710
Now, these little guys have
a great collective name—gut flora.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.839
And because they are so  much smaller

00:01:25.839 --> 00:01:28.927
than the average human cell, their numbers are staggering.

00:01:28.927 --> 00:01:32.056
Believe it or not, your body contains about

00:01:32.056 --> 00:01:35.053
ten trillion cells,

00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:38.598
but the number of bacteria and microorganisms inside your intestines

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:42.235
is nearly 100 trillion.

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:46.319
As these microorganisms digest food that you haven't or can't,

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:48.737
they produce helpful things like vitamin K,

00:01:48.737 --> 00:01:53.664
but they also produce chemicals that
lead to the reason that farts smell.

00:01:53.664 --> 00:01:59.078
And we all fart every day about a pint of fart every day.

00:01:59.078 --> 00:02:02.999
And if you say that you don't fart, you probably release that gas when you're in the bathroom,

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:06.758
or at night when you're asleep and
your muscles are more relaxed.

00:02:06.758 --> 00:02:11.096
But if this amount of gas used to be
inside you and now it's not,

00:02:11.096 --> 00:02:14.387
that must mean that every time you fart, you lose mass.

00:02:14.387 --> 00:02:16.886
You lose weight, but how much weight?

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:19.975
Well, luckily, some researchers have already figured this out.

00:02:19.975 --> 00:02:23.479
Assuming this average chemical makeup of a fart,

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:26.730
and what studies have shown is the typical volume of a fart,

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.149
it can be calculated that the average fart weighs

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:33.572
about three hundredths of a gram,

00:02:33.572 --> 00:02:39.708
and the part of it that actually
stinks only weighs .0008 grams.

00:02:39.708 --> 00:02:43.081
Okay, so a fart weighs three hundredths of a gram,

00:02:43.081 --> 00:02:46.667
I mean, what does that really mean?
Well, here's a fun way to think about it.

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:50.507
As you move further away from the center of the earth,

00:02:50.507 --> 00:02:53.473
the gravitational attraction between
the two of you decreases,

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:55.596
and your weight decreases.

00:02:55.596 --> 00:02:59.477
In fact, according to this fantastic
book about the scale of things,

00:02:59.477 --> 00:03:02.474
your weight decreases by about .5 percent

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:05.979
for every six miles you are above earth.

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:11.312
In fact, the average fart causes you to lose an amount of weight equivalent

00:03:11.312 --> 00:03:15.111
to being about a third of an inch further from earth.

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:19.500
The way your gut flora process the food that you eat

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.613
and influence how your farts smell

00:03:21.613 --> 00:03:25.412
is established within the first
two to three months of your life.

00:03:25.412 --> 00:03:28.754
When you're first born, your gastrointestinal tract

00:03:28.754 --> 00:03:30.837
is completely sterile.

00:03:30.837 --> 00:03:33.092
There are no microorganisms living in it.

00:03:33.092 --> 00:03:35.134
In fact, unlike the rest of your life,

00:03:35.134 --> 00:03:40.478
the very first poop that you take is almost completely sterile.

00:03:40.478 --> 00:03:44.053
It's so significant it has a special name, meconium.

00:03:44.053 --> 00:03:46.441
Now, I will spare you any pictures,

00:03:46.441 --> 00:03:50.819
but if you ever want to call someone a poop head,
try instead calling them a meconium head.

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.440
It's like a poop head, but with no experience.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.373
As soon as you leave your mother, you begin collecting microorganisms inside your digestive system.

00:03:59.373 --> 00:04:01.791
In fact, within the first five to ten minutes

00:04:01.791 --> 00:04:04.706
of being born, the gut flora that you have

00:04:04.706 --> 00:04:08.170
are almost exactly equivalent to the microorganisms living

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.253
in your mother's birth canal.

00:04:10.253 --> 00:04:14.885
Now later, these microorganisms come from your environment, especially from what you eat—

00:04:14.885 --> 00:04:20.093
milk or formula. This early in your life, microorganisms train your immune system

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:23.974
to not attack them, and so, within the first two or three months of your life,

00:04:23.974 --> 00:04:25.975
whatever microorganisms are there

00:04:25.975 --> 00:04:31.735
have largely established themselves as the exact colonial makeup of your gut flora for your entire life.

00:04:31.735 --> 00:04:35.992
That's all cool, but how loud can a fart get?

00:04:35.992 --> 00:04:39.872
Well, the Guinness Book of World Records doesn't know.

00:04:39.872 --> 00:04:41.955
In fact, there are a lot of records it doesn't keep,

00:04:41.955 --> 00:04:44.332
some of which it doesn't keep because they're dangerous.

00:04:44.332 --> 00:04:46.003
For instance, speed drinking.

00:04:46.003 --> 00:04:51.712
It's possible to open up your throat and literally pour liquid straight down your esophagus into your belly,

00:04:51.712 --> 00:04:55.338
but it is really dangerous and
should never be done by anybody.

00:04:55.338 --> 00:04:58.467
Now, burping they do have records of.

00:04:58.467 --> 00:05:02.053
The world record for the largest burp belongs to Paul Hunt

00:05:02.053 --> 00:05:06.725
from the United Kingdom whose
burp registered 109.9 decibels,

00:05:06.725 --> 00:05:08.736
about as loud as a car horn.

00:05:13.108 --> 00:05:16.776
Oh, and also, many of these microorganisms that live inside your gut

00:05:16.776 --> 00:05:19.031
and digest food and make farts smell bad

00:05:19.031 --> 00:05:22.109
also create gases that are flammable.

00:05:24.374 --> 00:05:26.660
We've all seen this, and it is very, very true.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.713
The Mythbusters even did an episode where they prove that farts can be lit on fire,

00:05:30.713 --> 00:05:34.127
but the episode was deemed too gross and never aired.

00:05:34.127 --> 00:05:36.677
Another thing you should know about farts

00:05:36.677 --> 00:05:39.887
is that when you hold them in,
many of the gasses inside them

00:05:39.887 --> 00:05:44.224
will get reabsorbed back into your blood stream
through the intestinal lumen.

00:05:44.224 --> 00:05:47.099
Now, the smelly stinky stuff doesn't travel this way,

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.812
but the nutrient stuff like oxygen will.

00:05:49.812 --> 00:05:53.733
And the blood stream brings these gasses back to the lungs

00:05:53.733 --> 00:05:56.648
where you exhale them, so if you hold in your farts a lot,

00:05:56.648 --> 00:06:00.946
you, in a way, will have literal fart breath.

00:06:00.946 --> 00:06:03.983
The Fitzroy River Turtle does one better.

00:06:03.983 --> 00:06:06.909
It can do what I like to call a reverse fart.

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:09.001
Because it spends so much time under water,

00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:13.126
it's developed a way to breathe through its butt.

00:06:13.126 --> 00:06:17.006
It actually can get up to 68 percent of the
oxygen it needs

00:06:17.006 --> 00:06:19.130
by simply opening up that cavity

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.385
and getting oxygen from the water.

00:06:21.385 --> 00:06:25.266
Finally, I want to leave you with the art of the fart.

00:06:25.266 --> 00:06:29.847
The way your farts sound is determined by the speed and the shape of their exit.

00:06:29.847 --> 00:06:32.397
But a select few cannot only make themselves

00:06:32.397 --> 00:06:35.729
create flatus on command, but can also modulate

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.401
the pitch and tone of their farts.

00:06:38.401 --> 00:06:41.032
These people are known as flatulists.

00:06:41.032 --> 00:06:44.079
And one of the most famous right now is Mr. Methane.

00:06:57.713 --> 00:06:59.460
Amazing, right?

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.802
Well, now that we've talked about farts,
let's move on to outer space.

00:07:02.802 --> 00:07:06.093
On YouTube.com/Spacelab, go over there now

00:07:06.093 --> 00:07:10.726
and you can ask me any question about outer space that you want, and every week I will answer

00:07:10.726 --> 00:07:13.275
three of them. So what are you waiting for?
Go check that out.

00:07:13.275 --> 00:07:15.429
And as always, thanks for watching.
