00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.101
Hey, Vsauce Michael here, and I am back in New York City.

00:00:04.101 --> 00:00:07.057
And today, we're going to talk about

00:00:07.057 --> 00:00:09.058
loneliness.

00:00:10.226 --> 00:00:14.462
But first, I just learned this yesterday, Bear Grylls,
the host of Man vs. Wild

00:00:14.462 --> 00:00:17.861
has three sons, and I'm not kidding,
their names are

00:00:17.861 --> 00:00:21.995
Jesse, Huckleberry, and Marmaduke.

00:00:21.995 --> 00:00:23.733
Well, here's another name for you.

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.500
Michael Collins.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.396
Not the Irish Revolutionary leader, but Michael Collins,
the NASA astronaut.

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:33.200
This guy was part of the Apollo 11 crew,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.288
meaning that he was part of the
team that went to, landed on the moon,

00:00:36.288 --> 00:00:39.001
and became the first people to
walk on the moon,

00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:42.384
except you might know Michael Collins'
name as well,

00:00:42.384 --> 00:00:44.934
because he did not get to walk on the moon.

00:00:44.934 --> 00:00:47.474
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin
walked around,

00:00:47.474 --> 00:00:49.643
but Michael Collins had to stay orbiting

00:00:49.643 --> 00:00:53.067
the moon in the command module
to link up with them later.

00:00:53.067 --> 00:00:55.779
Well, this is where things get lonely.

00:00:55.779 --> 00:01:00.188
People realize that Michael Collins, there
in the command module,

00:01:00.188 --> 00:01:04.150
orbiting the moon alone was in
a quite unique position.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.943
When he circled around to the far side of the moon,

00:01:06.943 --> 00:01:08.985
the side that faced away from Earth,

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:13.506
he lost all radio contact with Earth
and with Armstrong and Aldrin.

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:17.844
For about the 48 minutes that Michael Collins
was orbiting around the other end of the moon,

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:21.715
he was quite literally the most lonely

00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:25.260
a human being has ever been.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.013
He was the furthest from any other humans

00:01:28.013 --> 00:01:32.188
than any human has ever been
since the very beginning of mankind.

00:01:32.188 --> 00:01:36.811
If you haven't yet seen Veritasium's video about how far away the moon is from Earth,

00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:38.680
you should definitely check it out.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.987
But the whole point is that we tend to think that the moon is much closer than it really is,

00:01:42.987 --> 00:01:47.162
because most illustrations we see
put the two objects quite close

00:01:47.162 --> 00:01:49.641
because it's easier, but to scale,

00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:52.740
this is how far away the moon is.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.250
We actually measure the distance to the moon quite frequently using reflectors

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.123
that were left on the moon.

00:01:59.123 --> 00:02:01.967
That's right, they're just sitting there all alone
on the surface of the moon

00:02:01.967 --> 00:02:04.172
waiting for us to shoot lasers at them.

00:02:04.172 --> 00:02:06.843
By looking at how long it took the light to return to us,

00:02:06.843 --> 00:02:10.216
we can calculate quite accurately
how far away the moon is.

00:02:10.216 --> 00:02:11.933
And we've been doing this for a while,

00:02:11.933 --> 00:02:14.137
and one of the most bizarre things we've learned

00:02:14.137 --> 00:02:19.735
is that the moon is actually spiraling
away from Earth quite slowly.

00:02:19.735 --> 00:02:23.362
Every year, the moon is about 38 millimeters

00:02:23.362 --> 00:02:25.647
further away than it was the year before.

00:02:25.647 --> 00:02:29.111
Thirty-eight millimeters is about one and a half inches.

00:02:29.111 --> 00:02:33.002
Those reflectors are not the
only thing we left on the moon.

00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:36.090
We actually left a lot of man-made stuff,
a lot of junk there.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.742
There is an entire Wikipedia article just listing

00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:40.967
the big stuff we left behind.

00:02:40.967 --> 00:02:45.264
But there are man made objects that are even further away from the Earth than the moon.

00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:48.007
In fact, there are four things that humans have built

00:02:48.007 --> 00:02:52.802
that have traveled so far away from Earth,
they are no longer within our solar system.

00:02:52.802 --> 00:02:57.444
Voyager I is actually the furthest
man made object from Earth ever.

00:02:57.444 --> 00:03:01.726
And aboard, NASA included a gold plated record

00:03:01.726 --> 00:03:04.276
that contained information about humanity,

00:03:04.276 --> 00:03:07.771
just in case anything out there found them.

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:10.483
You can read all about everything
that NASA put on the disc

00:03:10.483 --> 00:03:12.413
by following a link in this video's description.

00:03:12.413 --> 00:03:14.872
But the item that has always resonated with me

00:03:14.872 --> 00:03:16.751
is a song they chose.

00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:19.006
They put lots and lots of audio on the disc,

00:03:19.006 --> 00:03:21.261
but one song in particular was chosen

00:03:21.261 --> 00:03:27.803
to represent to whoever or whatever found it, the human emotion of loneliness.

00:03:27.803 --> 00:03:33.807
The song is by blind Willie Johnson, and it's called
Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground.

00:03:33.807 --> 00:03:35.849
There are no lyrics, just humming.

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.267
You can listen to it by following
the link in this video's description.

00:03:38.267 --> 00:03:40.400
And as you listen, think about

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.655
the weight of that meaning.

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:44.728
This song was picked to represent

00:03:44.728 --> 00:03:48.568
to aliens what loneliness is.

00:03:48.568 --> 00:03:51.819
Blind Willie Johnson himself wasn't blind his whole life,

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.659
he was blinded as a child when his step mother threw lye in his face,

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.367
and he died of malarial fever after his home burned down

00:03:59.367 --> 00:04:02.465
and he had nowhere else to live but on wet newspaper.

00:04:02.465 --> 00:04:05.960
But now, his song is way out there

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.754
in inner stellar space representing us.

00:04:09.754 --> 00:04:12.101
Thanks for watching.

00:04:25.354 --> 00:04:33.944
This point of light is Earth, as seen from 4 billions miles away by Voyager 1 in 1990
