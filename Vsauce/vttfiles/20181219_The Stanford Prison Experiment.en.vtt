One of the most infamous

00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:07.440
psychological studies
ever conducted

00:00:07.473 --> 00:00:10.376
was the Stanford Prison
Experiment.

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:13.646
It's mentioned in almost every
intro to psychology textbook.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.316
They tend to focus on
how unethical it was,

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.687
and are less critical
of its supposed conclusion.

<i> Zimbardo's fame skyrockets,</i>

00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:04.490
<i> The study brings up
 a question</i>

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:07.293
<i> just as important then
 as it is today:</i>

00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:10.329
<i> is evil caused
 by the environment,</i>

00:02:10.362 --> 00:02:11.931
<i> or the personalities in it?</i>

00:02:11.964 --> 00:02:14.200
<i> Zimbardo's shocking conclusion</i>

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:16.335
<i> is that when people
 feel anonymous</i>

00:02:16.368 --> 00:02:18.771
<i> and have power over
 depersonalized others,</i>

00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:20.940
<i> they can easily become evil.</i>

00:02:20.973 --> 00:02:24.710
<i> And it occurs more often
 than we'd like to admit.</i>

00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:27.613
But while it's true that people
were mean to each other

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:29.682
during the Stanford
Prison Experiment,

00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:32.518
what if what truly caused
that behavior

00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:35.622
wasn't what we've always
been told?

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:55.374
<i> The Stanford Prison Experiment</i>

00:02:55.407 --> 00:02:57.510
<i> has always had
 its controversies.</i>

00:02:57.543 --> 00:02:59.312
<i> But a wave of recent
 revelations</i>

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:01.314
<i> have pushed it back
 into the spotlight</i>

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:02.682
<i> 47 years later.</i>

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:05.484
<i> Today, I'm going to speak
 with journalist Ben Blum,</i>

00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:07.420
<i> whose recent writings
 have brought criticism</i>

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:09.488
<i> of the experiment
 to a larger audience</i>

00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:10.722
<i> than ever before.</i>

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:13.926
How did you get involved in
the Stanford Prison Experiment

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.695
in the first place?

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:18.798 size:88% position:56% line:0%
Well, my involvement
was quite personal.

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:21.500
Like everyone,
I had kind of absorbed

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:23.769
the basic lesson
of the experiment

00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:25.938 size:84% position:42%
through the cultural ether.

00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:28.841
And then my cousin Alex
was arrested for bank robbery.

00:03:28.874 --> 00:03:33.646
This was a team of mostly
military guys with AK-47s.

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:34.814
Alex was the driver.

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:37.450
He was a 19-year-old
U.S. Army Ranger.

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:39.852
And it was a superior of his
on the Rangers

00:03:39.885 --> 00:03:41.421
that organized and led
the bank robbery.

00:03:42.988 --> 00:03:45.591
Alex thought the whole thing
was a training exercise.

00:03:45.624 --> 00:03:49.562
He was just so brainwashed
in this intense Ranger training

00:03:49.595 --> 00:03:53.399
that when a superior proposed
this bank robbery,

00:03:53.432 --> 00:03:57.804
he took it as just one more kind
of tactical thought experiment.

00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:02.341
Then Dr. Philip Zimbardo
participated

00:04:02.374 --> 00:04:04.277
in his legal defense.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.014
Zimbardo submits a letter
to the court,

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:10.816
advocating leniency
in sentencing on the grounds

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.387
that Alex, my cousin,
had been so transformed

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.990
by the social environment
of the Ranger battalion

00:04:18.023 --> 00:04:20.626
that he participated
in the bank robbery

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:23.763
without exercising
his own free will.

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:25.931
Well, how did that affect
Alex's sentencing?

00:04:25.964 --> 00:04:30.469
He received an extraordinarily
lenient sentence of 16 months.

00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:34.507
So Zimbardo was a family hero.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.910
But over time, Alex,
finally he did admit to me,

00:04:37.943 --> 00:04:40.046
you know what, I knew this was
a bank robbery by the end,

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:42.381
and I just didn't have the moral
courage to back out.

00:04:42.414 --> 00:04:43.683
Oh, wow.

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:46.585
Alex, myself and our
whole family

00:04:46.618 --> 00:04:50.089
came to view
the Zimbardo argument

00:04:50.122 --> 00:04:54.660
as a way to shirk personal
culpability,

00:04:54.693 --> 00:04:58.998
and to put all the blame
on the situation.

00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:00.599
So you start looking

00:05:00.632 --> 00:05:03.803
at the Stanford Prison
Experiment in particular.

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:06.372
You reached out to Dr. Zimbardo
himself,

00:05:06.405 --> 00:05:08.574
as well as some of those
who participated.

00:05:08.607 --> 00:05:10.343 align:start size:59% position:41%
What did you learn?

00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:13.512 size:63% position:31%
I learned,
to my deep surprise,

00:05:13.545 --> 00:05:16.482 align:start position:0%
that quite a number
of the participants

00:05:16.515 --> 00:05:20.986
had stories of their experience
that completely contradicted

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:21.887 align:start position:0%
the official narrative.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.591
Which is, look,
these regular people,

00:05:25.624 --> 00:05:26.959
good people,
came together,

00:05:26.992 --> 00:05:30.629
and because of the situation,
became evil.

00:05:30.662 --> 00:05:32.365
[Ben]
Right.

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:34.700
Zimbardo has claimed
that the guards

00:05:34.733 --> 00:05:36.102
were put in the situation,

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:39.739
and then the kind of hidden
wellspring of sadism

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:41.674
that apparently lies
in all of us

00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:43.609
unfolded organically.

00:05:43.642 --> 00:05:45.778 align:start size:56% position:44% line:0%
[Zimbardo]

00:05:54.186 --> 00:05:56.956
There was an orientation meeting
for the guards.

00:05:56.989 --> 00:06:00.393
They had been told
quite explicitly

00:06:00.426 --> 00:06:02.362
to oppress the prisoners.

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:05.898 size:88% position:56% line:0%
That falls under the heading
of what psychologists call

00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:07.800 line:0%
demand characteristics.

00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:09.668 line:0%
Experimental subjects
tend to be motivated

00:06:09.701 --> 00:06:12.705 line:0%
to give experimenters
what they want.

00:06:12.738 --> 00:06:14.073
[Michael]
<i> Demand characteristics occur</i>

00:06:14.106 --> 00:06:16.108
<i> whenever participants
 being studied</i>

00:06:16.141 --> 00:06:18.043
<i> act differently
 than they normally would</i>

00:06:18.076 --> 00:06:21.046
<i> because they've guessed
what hypothesis is being tested</i>

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:24.984
<i> and feel that a certain kind
 of behavior is being demanded.</i>

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:28.788
There was a recording
of explicitly correcting a guard

00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:31.524
who wasn't being tough enough.

00:06:58.917 --> 00:07:00.553
So a conclusion
you could make

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:02.721
from the Stanford
Prison Experiment

00:07:02.754 --> 00:07:05.458
is that when you tell people
to be cruel,

00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:07.059
they'll do it if you tell them

00:07:07.092 --> 00:07:09.061 size:75% position:63%
it's for a greater good,
like science.

00:07:09.094 --> 00:07:10.195
-Right.
-Who would have thought?

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:15.968
I think the study stands still
as a fascinating spur

00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:18.237
to further more careful research

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.240
as a demonstration that should
make anyone curious

00:07:21.273 --> 00:07:24.877
as to how such extreme behavior
could arise

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.111 align:start position:0%
in such a short time.

00:07:26.144 --> 00:07:29.748
The experiment could still
be useful,

00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:31.717
but it might need to be
reinterpreted.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.520
Its data might lead
to different conclusions

00:07:34.553 --> 00:07:36.889
than the one that we've been
telling for so many decades.

00:07:36.922 --> 00:07:38.458
Right.

00:07:39.691 --> 00:07:41.560
<i> The flaws in the experiment</i>

It's really an honor
to meet you.

00:08:07.052 --> 00:08:11.524
You're a living, walking piece
of psychology history.

00:08:11.557 --> 00:08:13.859
I'm never recognized in the
street or anything like that,

00:08:13.892 --> 00:08:16.295
although I still get
some hate mail.

00:08:16.328 --> 00:08:18.163
-Are you serious?
-Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:18.196 --> 00:08:20.900
Well, what do you say to them
when they react that way?

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:23.969
I say, well, there's probably
a lot about that

00:08:24.002 --> 00:08:27.740
that didn't happen quite the way
it's been portrayed.

00:08:27.773 --> 00:08:29.241
Well, Dave,
before we go too far,

00:08:29.274 --> 00:08:31.644
I'd like to watch the footage
we have here

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:34.113
so we can kind of talk about
what we see.

00:08:36.048 --> 00:08:37.049
[Dave]
That's me there, by the way.

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:39.285
-[Michael] Look at that look.
-[Dave] Mm-hmm.

00:08:39.318 --> 00:08:43.789
So how did you get involved with
a Stanford Prison Experiment?

00:08:43.822 --> 00:08:46.625 size:78% position:61%
My father was a professor
at Stanford,

00:08:46.658 --> 00:08:49.929 align:end position:100%
and I was home for summer,
looking for a summer job.

00:08:49.962 --> 00:08:52.131
So I'm looking
through the want ads.

00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:53.232
$15 a day.

00:08:53.265 --> 00:08:56.769
You know,
in 1971 that wasn't bad.

00:08:56.802 --> 00:08:58.938
The way it was introduced
to the guards,

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:01.307
the whole concept
of this experiment,

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.275
we were never led to believe

00:09:03.308 --> 00:09:06.579
that we were part
of the experiment.

00:09:06.612 --> 00:09:08.747 size:69% position:66%
We were led to believe
that our job

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.250
was to get results
from the prisoners,

00:09:11.283 --> 00:09:12.952
that they were the ones
the researchers

00:09:12.985 --> 00:09:14.320
are really studying.

00:09:17.856 --> 00:09:19.959
The researchers
were behind the wall.

00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:21.760
And we all knew
they were filming.

00:09:21.793 --> 00:09:23.362
And we can often hear
the researchers

00:09:23.395 --> 00:09:26.298
commenting on the action
from the other side of the wall.

00:09:26.331 --> 00:09:28.267
You know, like,
"Oh, gosh, did you see that?

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.202
Here. Make sure you get
a close-up of that."

00:09:30.235 --> 00:09:36.141
Okay? So if they want to show
that prison is a bad experience,

00:09:36.174 --> 00:09:37.109
I'm going to make it bad.

00:09:37.142 --> 00:09:39.211
But how did you feel
doing stuff like that?

00:09:39.244 --> 00:09:40.245
Didn't you feel bad?

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:41.480
I don't know if this
is a revelation to you,

00:09:41.513 --> 00:09:45.117
but 18-year-old boys are not
the most sensitive creatures.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.319
-Sure.
-My agenda was to be

00:09:47.352 --> 00:09:49.622
the worst guard
I could possibly be.

00:09:49.655 --> 00:09:51.624
-And it's pretty serious.
-Mm-hmm.

00:09:57.396 --> 00:10:01.066
This is my favorite part
of all the footage we have

00:10:01.099 --> 00:10:02.768
-from the experiment.
-Mm-hmm.

00:10:02.801 --> 00:10:06.038
It's you and a prisoner
confronting each other

00:10:06.071 --> 00:10:08.807
after the experiment.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.943
I remember the guy saying,
"I hate you, man."

00:10:10.976 --> 00:10:12.612
-Yeah.
-"I hate you."

00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:42.841
Each day I said, well,
what can we do to ramp up

00:10:42.874 --> 00:10:43.809
what we did yesterday?

00:10:43.842 --> 00:10:45.411
How can we build on that?

00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:47.312
Why did you want
to ramp things up?

00:10:47.345 --> 00:10:48.113
Two reasons, I think.

00:10:48.146 --> 00:10:50.783
One was because
I really believed

00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:55.087
I was helping the researchers
with some better understanding

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.156
of human behavior.

00:10:57.189 --> 00:10:58.023
On the other hand,

00:10:58.057 --> 00:11:00.259
it was personally
interesting to me.

00:11:00.292 --> 00:11:04.697
You know, I cannot say that I
did not enjoy what I was doing.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.400
Maybe, you know,
having so much power

00:11:08.433 --> 00:11:11.303
over these poor,
defenseless prisoners,

00:11:11.336 --> 00:11:15.207
you know, maybe you kind of
get off on that a little bit.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.878
You weren't entirely following
a script from a director.

00:11:19.911 --> 00:11:21.080
Right.

00:11:21.113 --> 00:11:22.981 align:start position:0%
But you also felt like

00:11:23.014 --> 00:11:25.751
Zimbardo wanted something
from you.

00:11:25.784 --> 00:11:27.486
-Yes.
-And you gave that to him.

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:29.221
I believe I did.
I think I decided

00:11:29.254 --> 00:11:31.356
I was going to do a better job
than anybody there

00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:33.992
of delivering
what he wanted.

00:11:34.025 --> 00:11:36.495
But does that excuse me
from what I was doing?

00:11:36.528 --> 00:11:39.865
Certainly it started out
with me playing a role.

00:11:39.898 --> 00:11:43.435
So the question is, was there
a point where I stopped acting

00:11:43.468 --> 00:11:45.838
and I started living,
so to speak?

00:11:49.775 --> 00:11:53.278
The standard narrative is that
Dave Eshelman did what he did

00:11:53.311 --> 00:11:55.247
because when people
are given power,

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.851
it's easier than we think
for abuse to happen.

00:11:58.884 --> 00:11:59.852
That may be true,

00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:03.822
but how predisposed
to aggression was Dave?

00:12:03.855 --> 00:12:05.390
I mean, he signed up
to something called

00:12:05.423 --> 00:12:07.993
a "prison study," after all.

00:12:08.026 --> 00:12:11.964
Also, his feeling
that cruelty was encouraged

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:16.034
and helped the experiment,
may have affected his behavior.

00:12:16.067 --> 00:12:17.936
What I'd like to see is,

00:12:17.969 --> 00:12:19.972
in the absence
of outside influence,

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:25.010
can anonymity, power,
and depersonalization alone

00:12:25.043 --> 00:12:27.179
lead to evil?

00:12:27.212 --> 00:12:28.514
<i> To answer that question,</i>

00:12:28.547 --> 00:12:29.815
<i> I'd like to design</i>

00:12:29.848 --> 00:12:31.383
<i> a demonstration of my own.</i>

00:12:31.416 --> 00:12:33.152
<i> So I'm meeting
 with Dr. Jared Bartels</i>

00:12:33.185 --> 00:12:34.853
<i> of William Jewell College,</i>

00:12:34.886 --> 00:12:36.922
<i> a psychologist who has written
 extensively</i>

00:12:36.955 --> 00:12:38.824
<i> about the Stanford
 Prison Experiment</i>

00:12:38.857 --> 00:12:40.459
<i> and how it is taught.</i>

00:12:40.492 --> 00:12:45.498
I would love to do the Stanford
Prison Experiment again.

00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:48.967 size:81% position:41% line:0%
You could probably make it
more ethical,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.435
but still find the same
conclusions.

00:12:50.468 --> 00:12:52.204
That's my hypothesis.

00:12:52.237 --> 00:12:53.839
I absolutely think
it's worthwhile.

00:12:53.872 --> 00:12:55.808
It's important.
It's interesting.

00:12:55.841 --> 00:12:57.009
Probably the best approach

00:12:57.042 --> 00:13:01.513
is eliminate as best as possible
the demand characteristics

00:13:01.546 --> 00:13:04.950
by eliminating that
prisoner/guard dynamic.

00:13:04.983 --> 00:13:07.119
Why do we even need to call one
group "guards"

00:13:07.152 --> 00:13:07.853
and one "prisoners"?

00:13:07.886 --> 00:13:09.254
There's a lot of expectations

00:13:09.287 --> 00:13:10.556
around those roles.

00:13:10.589 --> 00:13:11.857
Oh, I'm a guard?

00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:14.193
-I guess I should act like a
guard. 
-Yeah, you're right.

00:13:14.226 --> 00:13:15.994
The cover story is really
important,

00:13:16.027 --> 00:13:19.998
and you want to hide the true
purpose of the experiment.

00:13:20.031 --> 00:13:23.869
Another piece of this
is the role of personality

00:13:23.902 --> 00:13:25.137
and personality traits.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.906
So the original ad
in the Stanford study

00:13:27.939 --> 00:13:31.610
asked for participants
for a study of prison life.

00:13:31.643 --> 00:13:33.445
You know, that's going to draw
certain people

00:13:33.478 --> 00:13:36.949
that were more kind of disposed
to aggression.

00:13:36.982 --> 00:13:38.851
[Michael]
Because they saw the word
"prison" and thought,

00:13:38.884 --> 00:13:41.086
-"I want to be a part of that."
-Exactly.

00:13:41.119 --> 00:13:43.255
So when you get a group

00:13:43.288 --> 00:13:47.926
of kind of authoritarian-minded
individuals together,

00:13:47.959 --> 00:13:50.262
not surprisingly
they're going to create

00:13:50.295 --> 00:13:53.065
an authoritarian regime
and environment.

00:13:53.098 --> 00:13:54.633 size:84% position:42%
So, for whatever it is that
we're going to do,

00:13:54.666 --> 00:13:56.635 align:start position:0%
we should evaluate
the personalities

00:13:56.668 --> 00:13:58.036 align:start position:0%
of the individuals.

00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.937
Right.

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:01.340
So how do we give people
every opportunity

00:14:01.373 --> 00:14:04.343
to be as evil as they can?

00:14:04.376 --> 00:14:06.378
I think you have
to have those elements

00:14:06.411 --> 00:14:09.214 align:start size:53% position:47%
that were assumed
to be influential

00:14:09.247 --> 00:14:10.048 align:start size:69% position:31%
in the Stanford study.

00:14:10.081 --> 00:14:11.149
What are those elements?

00:14:11.182 --> 00:14:13.085
You have to have
the depersonalization.

00:14:13.118 --> 00:14:15.354
You have to have anonymity.

00:14:15.387 --> 00:14:19.258
You have to have some power
differences.

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:22.294
Can we elicit
some surprising behaviors

00:14:22.327 --> 00:14:23.929
in just a number of hours?

00:14:23.962 --> 00:14:26.031
If you kind of come back
to the Stanford study,

00:14:26.064 --> 00:14:28.967
there wasn't anything dramatic
that happened

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.469
-in the first day of the study.
-Yeah.

00:14:30.502 --> 00:14:32.471 size:66% position:67%
It was the second day
of the study

00:14:32.504 --> 00:14:35.674
when the guards started to
assert their authority.

00:14:35.707 --> 00:14:39.411
That came about because
of prisoners testing

00:14:39.444 --> 00:14:41.113
and challenging the guards'
authority.

00:14:41.146 --> 00:14:43.682
[Michael]
Yeah, and that led to fear.

00:14:43.715 --> 00:14:47.219
That, like, wait a second,
these prisoners need to be

00:14:47.252 --> 00:14:49.187
-put more in check.
-Yeah. Yeah.

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.224 size:78% position:61%
So I think you still need
that provocation.

00:14:52.257 --> 00:14:52.925
Yeah.

00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.560
Something that is frustrating.

00:14:55.593 --> 00:14:57.462 size:69% position:66%
Something that's going
to increase

00:14:57.495 --> 00:14:58.931 align:start size:81% position:19%
the participants' arousal.

00:14:58.964 --> 00:15:01.199
Right. All right, so, Jared,

00:15:01.232 --> 00:15:02.701 size:69% position:34%
would you like
to spend some time now

00:15:02.734 --> 00:15:06.939
brainstorming a new design

00:15:06.972 --> 00:15:09.541
that peeks into the same
questions?

00:15:09.574 --> 00:15:11.276
-Absolutely.
-Awesome.

00:15:15.347 --> 00:15:17.582
[Michael]
<i> Jared and I sat down
 with the Mind Field crew</i>

00:15:17.615 --> 00:15:19.551
<i> to begin the planning process.</i>

00:15:19.584 --> 00:15:23.622
Will a person,
without any expectations

00:15:23.655 --> 00:15:28.126
or pushes in a certain direction
still be abusive or not?

00:15:28.159 --> 00:15:29.294
<i> For this demonstration,</i>

00:15:29.327 --> 00:15:31.997
<i> we want to eliminate
 all outside variables</i>

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.566
<i> and really isolate
 the three core elements</i>

00:15:34.599 --> 00:15:36.535
<i> of the Stanford Prison
 Experiment.</i>

00:15:36.568 --> 00:15:39.571 align:start size:69% position:31% line:0%
<i> The first element
 is anonymity.</i>

00:15:39.604 --> 00:15:42.474
<i> Subjects need to believe
that no matter how they behave,</i>

00:15:42.507 --> 00:15:43.943
<i> no one will know
 it was them.</i>

00:15:45.077 --> 00:15:47.179 size:88% position:56% line:0%
This is where people will be
coming in in the morning.

00:15:47.212 --> 00:15:49.414
This way, everyone's going to be
staggered when they come in.

00:15:49.447 --> 00:15:51.249
That's important,
because we don't want them

00:15:51.282 --> 00:15:55.387
to ever meet their teammates
face-to-face.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.990
<i> The original experiment
 gave guards anonymity</i>

00:15:58.023 --> 00:16:00.726
<i> by providing mirrored
 sunglasses and uniforms.</i>

00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:02.127
<i> But we're taking it
 much further.</i>

00:16:02.161 --> 00:16:06.465
<i> Our study will take place
 in a room that is pitch-black.</i>

00:16:06.498 --> 00:16:08.266
[Jared]
They'll be taken into this room.

00:16:08.299 --> 00:16:10.435
[Michael]
Ah. I would love to see how dark

00:16:10.468 --> 00:16:12.170
this room is going to be
tomorrow.

00:16:12.203 --> 00:16:13.372
[man]
Yeah, absolutely.

00:16:13.405 --> 00:16:15.540
-You ready?
-I'm ready.

00:16:15.573 --> 00:16:17.542
-Oh, yeah.
-[man] Right?

00:16:17.575 --> 00:16:20.078
[Michael]
This is uncomfortable.

00:16:20.111 --> 00:16:21.079
<i> Despite the darkness,</i>

00:16:21.112 --> 00:16:22.748
<i> we will be able
 to see everything,</i>

00:16:22.781 --> 00:16:24.783
<i> thanks to infrared cameras.</i>

00:16:24.816 --> 00:16:28.387 line:0%
<i> The second element
 is depersonalization.</i>

00:16:31.489 --> 00:16:33.325 line:0%
<i> From the moment
 the subjects arrive,</i>

00:16:33.358 --> 00:16:36.695 line:0%
<i> they will only be identified
 by number, not name.</i>

00:16:37.695 --> 00:16:39.297
[woman]
So, come on in.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:40.765
<i> To eliminate the demand
 characteristics,</i>

00:16:40.798 --> 00:16:43.201
<i> we don't want our subjects
 to know what we're studying.</i>

00:16:43.234 --> 00:16:46.238
Follow the sound of my voice,
if you can.

00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:48.273
<i> All they'll be told
 is that we are studying</i>

00:16:48.306 --> 00:16:52.377
<i> how they solve puzzles
 in the dark.</i>

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.613
There is another team
in a different location.

00:16:54.646 --> 00:16:57.249
-who is also solving a puzzle.
-Okay.

00:16:57.282 --> 00:16:59.684
<i> Because the words
 "guard" and "prisoner"</i>

00:16:59.717 --> 00:17:02.354
<i> suggest certain
 expected behaviors,</i>

00:17:02.387 --> 00:17:03.622
<i> we've done away with them</i>

00:17:03.655 --> 00:17:07.359
<i> and will simply give
 our participants an unseen,</i>

00:17:07.392 --> 00:17:10.629
<i> distantly located
 opposing team.</i>

00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:12.497
<i> We will measure
 the cruelty predicted</i>

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:13.498
<i> by the standard narrative</i>

00:17:13.531 --> 00:17:15.100
<i> of the Stanford
 Prison Experiment</i>

00:17:15.133 --> 00:17:16.301
<i> by giving our participants</i>

00:17:16.334 --> 00:17:19.438 line:0%
<i> a way to exercise
 the third element: power.</i>

00:17:19.471 --> 00:17:21.506
What I'm going to show you next
is the system

00:17:21.539 --> 00:17:23.542
by which you can send them
a loud noise.

00:17:23.575 --> 00:17:24.843
-Okay.
-So if you want to...

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:27.112
<i> We've armed the teams
 with a "distractor button"</i>

00:17:27.145 --> 00:17:29.514
<i> that they can press to blast
 an extremely loud,</i>

00:17:29.547 --> 00:17:33.085
<i> jarring noise
 into the other team's room.</i>

00:17:33.118 --> 00:17:34.820
<i> Everyone will have
 a volume dial</i>

00:17:34.853 --> 00:17:36.822
<i>that ranges from level 1 to 12,</i>

00:17:36.855 --> 00:17:39.591
<i> and they'll be told
 that anything below a 7</i>

00:17:39.624 --> 00:17:42.127
<i> should be safe
 for the other team's hearing.</i>

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.662 size:69% position:66%
And each person
has their own control.

00:17:43.695 --> 00:17:44.630 align:start position:0%
Okay.

00:17:44.663 --> 00:17:46.731 align:end position:100%
So they can't see
what you're doing.

00:17:46.764 --> 00:17:48.567 size:59% position:30%
-You can't see
what they're doing.
-Okay.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.702
<i> The intensity level
 they select,</i>

00:17:50.735 --> 00:17:53.371
<i> as well as the frequency with
 which they push the button,</i>

00:17:53.404 --> 00:17:55.307
<i> will be our indicator
 of how aggressive</i>

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.443

00:26:45.002 --> 00:26:47.171

 did it in retaliation</i>

00:26:47.204 --> 00:26:48.272
<i> to our buzzes.</i>

00:26:48.305 --> 00:26:50.375
<i> So we decided to see
 what would happen</i>

00:26:50.408 --> 00:26:51.743
<i> if we laid off.</i>

[man 1]

00:26:56.347 --> 00:26:58.850 size:66% position:67%
It's been probably
four or five minutes,

00:26:58.883 --> 00:27:00.952 size:88% position:56%
and we have not blasted them
with the noise,

00:27:00.985 --> 00:27:03.288 size:56% position:72%
and they haven't
played one either.

00:27:07.058 --> 00:27:10.028
I have a feeling like if we
never played a noise in their
room,

00:27:10.061 --> 00:27:12.830
they would never touch
the distractor button.

00:27:12.863 --> 00:27:14.699 size:84% position:42%
[Jared]
Probably not at this point.

00:27:14.732 --> 00:27:18.703
<i> In the end, we buzzed
this group a total of 44 times,</i>

00:27:18.736 --> 00:27:21.339
<i> and they buzzed us 38 times,</i>

00:27:21.372 --> 00:27:23.408
<i> 37 of which came
 from number two</i>

00:27:23.441 --> 00:27:26.744
<i> but always in retaliation,
 and never above a 5.</i>

00:27:26.777 --> 00:27:31.015
All right, guys.
Puzzle pieces down.

00:27:31.048 --> 00:27:33.718
<i> The situational factors
 did not seem to be sufficient</i>

00:27:33.751 --> 00:27:36.754
<i> to make this group sadistic.</i>

00:27:36.787 --> 00:27:38.790
<i> It was time
 for phase 2.</i>

[woman 1]

00:27:42.026 --> 00:27:43.928 align:start size:16% position:84% line:0%
Yeah.

00:27:43.961 --> 00:27:45.263
-Oh, she...
-[high-pitch squeal]

00:27:46.997 --> 00:27:47.832
It looks like it's at 7.

00:27:49.467 --> 00:27:50.968
-Wow.
-Yeah, she's--

00:27:51.001 --> 00:27:53.371
She's going nuts.
At a 7.

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.779
So number three believes
there is no other team.

00:28:01.812 --> 00:28:04.182
That might explain why she was
just going nuts on the button,

00:28:04.215 --> 00:28:05.883
because she doesn't feel bad
about it.

00:28:05.916 --> 00:28:07.852
[buttons clicking]

00:28:07.885 --> 00:28:10.321
Okay, they're all pushing
the button a lot more.

00:28:10.354 --> 00:28:12.290 size:56% position:72%
And they were told
this time

00:28:12.323 --> 00:28:14.693 size:53% position:73%
that it was their
only task.

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:20.298
[buttons clicking]

00:28:20.331 --> 00:28:21.466
[all laugh]

00:28:24.535 --> 00:28:26.270
What a difference
this has made.

00:28:26.303 --> 00:28:28.372
Just like in the Stanford
Prison Experiment.

00:28:28.405 --> 00:28:29.540
If you tell people

00:28:29.573 --> 00:28:32.243
that they have a certain task
to do, they'll do it,

00:28:32.276 --> 00:28:34.912
even if it's going to mean
that they've been broken.

00:28:34.945 --> 00:28:37.849
The thing is, they never hit
upon what we really cared about,

00:28:37.882 --> 00:28:40.351 size:78% position:61%
which is turning the dial
into an unsafe level.

00:28:40.384 --> 00:28:41.052 align:start position:0%
Yeah.

00:28:41.085 --> 00:28:43.755
[buttons click]

00:28:43.788 --> 00:28:46.090
[Michael] Hello, everyone.
I'm going to turn the lights on
in this room.

00:28:46.123 --> 00:28:47.258
[woman 1]
Okay.

00:28:48.926 --> 00:28:51.429
-And slowly...
-Ah, it hurts.

00:28:51.462 --> 00:28:53.865
...you can look.

00:28:53.898 --> 00:28:55.833
So, hello.

00:28:55.866 --> 00:28:58.069
-I'm Michael,
and this is Jared.
-Hi.

00:28:58.102 --> 00:29:00.772
I'll give you time
to adjust your eyes.

00:29:00.805 --> 00:29:04.075
Today, you've been part
of a study where all we wanted

00:29:04.108 --> 00:29:06.511
was to see what would happen
when we put people in a room

00:29:06.544 --> 00:29:08.913
and gave them that feeling
of anonymity

00:29:08.946 --> 00:29:10.181 align:start position:0%
that comes from, well,

00:29:10.214 --> 00:29:12.416 size:66% position:33%
if I crank my dial up
really high,

00:29:12.449 --> 00:29:14.118 size:50% position:25%
no one will know
it's me.

00:29:14.151 --> 00:29:16.854 size:88% position:56%
So you have this opportunity
to be cruel.

00:29:16.887 --> 00:29:18.256 size:38% position:81%
I thought
I went nuts.

00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:21.526 size:84% position:58%
Like, when the other person
was pressing--

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:25.930
Sure, but that's--
that's just in-kind retribution.

00:29:25.963 --> 00:29:29.066 size:50% position:25%
As it turns out,
so far,

00:29:29.099 --> 00:29:33.070
everyone stays in that
"below 7 or under" range.

00:29:33.103 --> 00:29:35.840
-Yeah.
-This final phase was us

00:29:35.873 --> 00:29:38.042 size:84% position:42%
trying to ramp up
the demand characteristics.

00:29:38.075 --> 00:29:42.079
And I believe number one, right,
you did say at one point,

00:29:42.112 --> 00:29:44.282 size:56% position:28%
"You've broken me.
I did it, fine."

00:29:44.315 --> 00:29:46.317 size:72% position:64%
So I loved that phrase,
because it says

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:48.286 align:start size:81% position:19%
"I didn't want to do this,

00:29:48.319 --> 00:29:51.088
but I'm doing it because I
believe it was expected of me."

00:29:51.121 --> 00:29:52.256
[all]
Thank you. Thanks.

00:29:52.289 --> 00:29:54.091
[Michael]<i> After dismissing
 our participants,</i>

00:29:54.124 --> 00:29:56.928
<i> Jared and I sat down
 to discuss our results.</i>

00:29:56.961 --> 00:29:58.830
Really fascinating.

00:29:58.863 --> 00:30:01.399
We brought in people who had
very different personalities

00:30:01.432 --> 00:30:04.168
than those Zimbardo chose.

00:30:04.201 --> 00:30:07.038
We put them in a situation that
did not demand things from them.

00:30:07.071 --> 00:30:10.341
And they behaved according
to that personality.

00:30:10.374 --> 00:30:15.613
I think we have some intriguing
support for the idea

00:30:15.646 --> 00:30:19.383
that it's more than just
the situation.

00:30:19.416 --> 00:30:23.554
We really saw personality
kind of shine through.

00:30:23.587 --> 00:30:26.490 size:72% position:36%
For the most part,
they seemed to be aware

00:30:26.523 --> 00:30:28.292
-of where that line is...
-Yeah.

00:30:28.325 --> 00:30:30.127
...that they shouldn't cross,
and they didn't.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.030 align:start position:0%
None of them did.

00:30:34.064 --> 00:30:36.968
<i> It was now time to speak
 with the man himself,</i>

00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:38.903
<i> Dr. Philip Zimbardo,</i>

00:30:38.936 --> 00:30:41.005
<i> who I worked with
 on last season's episode,</i>

00:30:41.038 --> 00:30:42.607
<i> "How to Make a Hero."</i>

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.276 size:53% position:73%
Okay. Lisa, Bear,
you guys ready?

00:30:45.309 --> 00:30:48.145 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
<i> For years, Dr. Zimbardo

00:30:50.014 --> 00:30:52.016 line:0%
<i> always maintaining

00:30:52.049 --> 00:30:53.584
<i> I asked him about
 whether his study</i>

00:30:53.617 --> 00:30:55.419
<i> is better seen
 as one on the power</i>

00:30:55.452 --> 00:30:56.988
<i> of demands from authority,</i>

00:30:57.021 --> 00:30:58.956
<i> but he wasn't receptive
 to that idea.</i>

00:30:58.989 --> 00:31:02.526
<i>I then told him about the study
 we ran to get his reaction.</i>

00:31:02.559 --> 00:31:06.097
I wanted to know what the
sufficient conditions might be

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:09.367
to make anyone
do something evil.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.370 size:69% position:66%
And we struggled
to get that to happen.

00:31:12.403 --> 00:31:14.472
We couldn't get anyone
to be cruel.

00:31:14.505 --> 00:31:20.011
Just giving them anonymity,
and a dehumanized other,

00:31:20.044 --> 00:31:22.113
and the power
to hurt that other,

00:31:22.146 --> 00:31:23.481
they didn't take
advantage of it.

00:31:23.514 --> 00:31:25.483 size:78% position:39% line:0%
<i> Well, I mean,
 maybe the problem was,</i>

00:31:25.516 --> 00:31:27.985 size:72% position:36% line:0%
<i> here's a case where,
 by picking people</i>

00:31:28.018 --> 00:31:30.087 size:66% position:33% line:0%
<i> who were extremely
 conscientious,</i>

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.622 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> extremely mindful,</i>

00:31:31.655 --> 00:31:34.625
<i> by selecting people
 who are high on compassion,</i>

00:31:34.658 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> high on mindfulness,</i>

00:31:36.393 --> 00:31:39.530 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> you broke the power
 of the situation.</i>

00:31:39.563 --> 00:31:42.133 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> In the Stanford
 Prison Experiment,</i>

00:31:42.166 --> 00:31:45.102 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> we had, I presume,</i>

00:31:45.135 --> 00:31:47.705 size:69% position:34%
<i> a relatively normal
 distribution.</i>

00:31:47.738 --> 00:31:50.207 size:81% position:41%
<i> We gave them
 six personality scales.</i>

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.510 size:88% position:44%
<i> And we picked people who,
 in the scales,</i>

00:31:52.543 --> 00:31:56.213 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> who were mostly
 in the mid-range.</i>

00:31:56.246 --> 00:31:57.247 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> In that situation,</i>

00:31:57.281 --> 00:32:00.551
<i> some people behave cruelly,
 evilly.</i>

00:32:00.584 --> 00:32:04.221
<i> Not everybody, but more
 of the guards than not.</i>

00:32:04.254 --> 00:32:09.060
<i> So, again, I think that
 your study is a demonstration</i>

00:32:09.093 --> 00:32:12.697
<i>of one way in which personality
 dominates situation.</i>

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:15.166
-Ah.
<i> -Where the personalities are--</i>

00:32:15.199 --> 00:32:17.335 size:81% position:41%
<i> so I would say
 it's a positive result.</i>

00:32:17.368 --> 00:32:21.539 size:63% position:31%
<i> The personalities
 are special.</i>

00:32:21.572 --> 00:32:24.442
Where does this balance lie
between the personal,

00:32:24.475 --> 00:32:26.444
the disposition,
the personality,

00:32:26.477 --> 00:32:29.280
and the situation,
the environment?

00:32:29.313 --> 00:32:31.082 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> No, that's the big--</i>

00:32:31.115 --> 00:32:32.483
<i> that's the ultimate question.</i>

00:32:32.516 --> 00:32:35.119 size:69% position:34%
<i> Where is, you know,
 how much of one</i>

00:32:35.152 --> 00:32:36.554
<i> and how much of the other...?</i>

00:32:36.587 --> 00:32:38.022
Right.

00:32:40.391 --> 00:32:43.461
Zimbardo insists
that demand characteristics

00:32:43.494 --> 00:32:46.330
played little role
in his subject's behavior.

00:32:46.363 --> 00:32:49.700
Critics like Ben Blum
say they played a big role,

00:32:49.733 --> 00:32:52.737
that what happened
was what was asked for.

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:54.305
If that's true,

00:32:54.338 --> 00:32:56.173
then the Stanford
Prison Experiment,

00:32:56.206 --> 00:33:00.077
like the classic Milgram study,
still has an important lesson.

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:02.146
People are quick to be cruel

00:33:02.179 --> 00:33:04.749
if an authority figure suggests
that doing so

00:33:04.782 --> 00:33:07.018
will serve a greater cause.

00:33:07.051 --> 00:33:11.455
In our test, we made sure that
such influences didn't exist.

00:33:11.488 --> 00:33:14.625
And not one participant
acted maliciously.

00:33:14.658 --> 00:33:18.629
Personality rose above
the situation.

00:33:18.662 --> 00:33:20.631
Learning how that happens
is vital

00:33:20.664 --> 00:33:23.634
if we want to improve conditions
where power is involved.

00:33:23.667 --> 00:33:26.804
So it's great that this debate
is still ongoing.

00:33:26.837 --> 00:33:29.473
And look, questioning methods
and interpretations

00:33:29.506 --> 00:33:31.242
is not a personal attack.

00:33:31.275 --> 00:33:34.712
It's how we improve
our confidence in what we know.

00:33:34.745 --> 00:33:36.580
And that's how science works.

00:33:36.613 --> 00:33:41.052
So stay curious,
never stop asking questions,

00:33:41.085 --> 00:33:43.488
and, as always,
thanks for watching.
