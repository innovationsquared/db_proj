- What emotions correlate
to what colors?

00:22:22.607 --> 00:22:24.809 line:0%
- Well, there's a rough sense
in which when you're angry,

00:22:24.842 --> 00:22:26.845 line:0%
<i> you're showing
 oxygenated blood.</i>

00:22:26.878 --> 00:22:28.413 line:0%
<i> When you're sad,
 it's more likely</i>

00:22:28.446 --> 00:22:30.014 line:0%
<i> to be showing greener.</i>

00:22:30.047 --> 00:22:31.816 line:0%
<i> If you're fearful,
 your blood pumps away</i>

00:22:31.849 --> 00:22:32.984 line:0%
<i> from the periphery,
 which means</i>

00:22:33.017 --> 00:22:34.786 line:0%
<i> that it gets yellower.</i>

00:22:34.819 --> 00:22:36.621 align:start position:0%
- So, Mark, you've brought
some tools with you,

00:22:36.654 --> 00:22:38.990 align:start position:0%
an invention of yours,
actually, that helps us

00:22:39.023 --> 00:22:42.427 align:start position:0%
better perceive
these color changes.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.462 align:start size:75% position:25%
- That's right, so these
are what paramedics wear

00:22:44.495 --> 00:22:45.930 align:end position:100%
'cause they're nice,
protective eyewear

00:22:45.963 --> 00:22:47.532 align:end position:100%
that they should
be wearing anyway,

00:22:47.565 --> 00:22:49.401
<i> and when you wear these,
 your veins,</i>

00:22:49.434 --> 00:22:50.969
<i> suddenly they're glowing
 a little bit.</i>

00:22:51.002 --> 00:22:53.571
<i> The same technology that helps
 paramedics see veins</i>

00:22:53.604 --> 00:22:55.106 align:end position:100%
also allows you
to see emotions better

00:22:55.139 --> 00:22:57.108 align:end position:100%
because it's enhancing
that same oxygenation signal

00:22:57.141 --> 00:22:58.710
that those emotions rely upon.

00:22:58.743 --> 00:23:01.079 align:start position:0% line:0%
- So you've got glasses
that allow us

00:23:01.112 --> 00:23:05.550 line:0%
<i> to better see the colors
 that are related to emotion</i>

00:23:05.583 --> 00:23:07.085 line:0%
<i> and how it's affected
 by blood flow.</i>

00:23:07.118 --> 00:23:08.920 align:end position:100% line:0%
- That's right.
This is not the kind of thing--

00:23:08.953 --> 00:23:10.755 align:end position:100%
it's not like you look
and it says, "angry,"

00:23:10.788 --> 00:23:12.123 align:end position:100%
you know,
written across the screen.

00:23:12.156 --> 00:23:14.025 align:end position:100%
No, it works on your
normal intuitions.

00:23:14.058 --> 00:23:17.195 align:end position:100%
The idea is that it makes
those signals easier to see,

00:23:17.228 --> 00:23:18.797 align:end position:100%
so it should give you
more insight

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:22.066 align:start size:66% position:34%
into what their mood,
what their intent is.

00:23:22.099 --> 00:23:24.736 line:0%
<i> - Whether through technology
 or evolution,</i>

00:23:24.769 --> 00:23:27.038 line:0%
<i> we humans have always found
 a way to read</i>

00:23:27.071 --> 00:23:29.174 line:0%
<i> and use facial expressions.</i>

00:23:29.207 --> 00:23:31.443 line:0%
<i> And those expressions
 show no sign</i>

00:23:31.476 --> 00:23:33.545 line:0%
<i> of becoming less important,</i>

00:23:33.578 --> 00:23:38.116 line:0%
<i> unless we evolve past
 having faces, of course.</i>

00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:40.685
So, did you like the show?

00:23:40.718 --> 00:23:43.455
If you didn't,
put a pencil in your mouth

00:23:43.488 --> 00:23:45.056
and go watch it again.

00:23:45.089 --> 00:23:47.592
If you enjoy it more
or less or the same,

00:23:47.625 --> 00:23:48.993
just let us know.

00:23:49.026 --> 00:23:51.196
Science will thank you.

00:23:51.229 --> 00:23:54.599
And as always,
thanks for watching.
