Someday, I will die.

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:15.214
But should I?

00:00:15.247 --> 00:00:16.616
If I was offered
a longer life,

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:18.785
I would take that
in a second.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:21.687
But how long is too long?

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.092
Is death something
I should deny forever,

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:30.263
or is death and the role
it plays in the universe

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:33.199
something I am better off
accepting?

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:58.257
I want to start by looking
at a particular way

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.428
death affects how we live
and treat one another.

manage the terror
of death's inevitability

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:13.773
by embracing cultural values.

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:17.777
That the more aware a person is
of their own mortality,

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.445
the more vehemently
they will enforce

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:22.615
their particular views
of the world onto others.

 of death.</i>

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.331

 has a worldview,</i>

Well, I think we're going
to hope for the participants

of their mortality

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:22.842

Okay. All right.

00:09:11.383 --> 00:09:12.885 align:start position:0%
Yeah.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.088
-That's right.
-[all laugh]

00:09:16.121 --> 00:09:18.591
So we are looking into

00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:21.660
something that's called
Terror Management Theory.

00:09:21.693 --> 00:09:25.331
And it's the idea that your own
awareness of your mortality

00:09:25.364 --> 00:09:29.802
can affect the behaviors
that you exhibit.

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:31.804
That we all manage the terror
that we feel

00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:36.175
knowing that we are mortal,
by behaving in certain ways,

00:09:36.208 --> 00:09:38.143
especially in ways that
reinforce our own worldviews.

00:09:38.176 --> 00:09:41.180
Because we could kind of live on
through the societies

00:09:41.213 --> 00:09:43.382
and cultures and identities
that we have today.

00:09:43.415 --> 00:09:45.651
[Jeff] Did any of you feel like
you were still thinking

00:09:45.684 --> 00:09:48.787
a little bit about death
when you came in here?

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:52.024
I was definitely going
after people who transgressed

00:09:52.057 --> 00:09:53.926
against my worldview,
to use your term.

00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:57.162
-Yes, I noticed that.
-I was definitely doing that.

00:09:57.195 --> 00:09:58.931
[Michael]
So this was incredibly helpful.

00:09:58.964 --> 00:10:00.699
-[Jeff] Yeah.
-[Michael] Thank you very much.

00:10:00.732 --> 00:10:03.002
[Jeff] Thanks so much.
I appreciate.

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:05.771
[Michael]
<i>It looks like our experimental
 stimuli were successful.</i>

00:10:05.804 --> 00:10:07.706
<i> They were salient, but didn't
 cause the participants</i>

00:10:07.739 --> 00:10:09.742
<i> to think they were related
 to the study.</i>

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:14.713
The control participants
averaged about 4.5.

00:10:14.746 --> 00:10:18.283
The experimental participants
were close to 4.7,

00:10:18.316 --> 00:10:20.185 align:start position:0% line:85%
if we round up.

00:10:20.218 --> 00:10:24.023
So there's a slight tendency
for the experimental people

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:27.893
to be leaning in the direction
that we predicted.

00:10:27.926 --> 00:10:29.194
But we're talking about

00:10:29.227 --> 00:10:31.864
relatively inconsequential
differences.

00:10:31.897 --> 00:10:33.999
That's right. It just makes me
hungry to run more people.

00:10:34.032 --> 00:10:35.334
And with the number that we had,

00:10:35.367 --> 00:10:37.836
that's statistically
insignificant.

00:10:37.869 --> 00:10:40.773
Do you think that we did
see any effects

00:10:40.806 --> 00:10:42.908
of mortality salience today?

00:10:42.941 --> 00:10:45.177
[Jeff] I feel like the mortality
salient groups

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.079 align:end position:100%
tended to think a little
longer before responding.

00:10:47.112 --> 00:10:48.313 align:start position:0%
Yeah, me too.

00:10:48.346 --> 00:10:50.015
[Jeff]
And they seemed more thoughtful.

00:10:50.048 --> 00:10:51.950
-They were really--
-They put more effort into it,

00:10:51.983 --> 00:10:53.752 align:end position:100%
into trying to do
the right thing.

00:10:53.785 --> 00:10:56.155
The difference was dramatic
enough that we picked up on it.

00:10:56.188 --> 00:10:58.757
-Absolutely.
<i> -Although our stimuli</i>

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.893
<i> might need to go through
 more passes and more vetting,</i>

00:11:00.926 --> 00:11:02.261 line:0%
<i> we did find
 an interesting difference</i>

00:11:02.294 --> 00:11:03.462 line:0%
<i> in the time it took</i>

00:11:03.495 --> 00:11:05.330 line:0%
<i> for our groups to respond.</i>

00:11:05.363 --> 00:11:07.266
<i> Our control group took
 an average</i>

00:11:07.299 --> 00:11:10.469
<i> of 4 minutes and 46 seconds
to decide on their punishments,</i>

00:11:10.502 --> 00:11:12.171
<i> but our experimental group</i>

00:11:12.204 --> 00:11:15.441
<i> took an average
 of 7 minutes, 18 seconds.</i>

00:11:15.474 --> 00:11:19.178
In a sense,
that really is the prediction.

00:11:19.211 --> 00:11:20.779 size:72% position:64%
The right thing
by their own worldview,

00:11:20.812 --> 00:11:22.481 size:81% position:59%
but by the same token,
when we think about death,

00:11:22.514 --> 00:11:24.083 size:84% position:58%
we want to do what's right.

00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:26.351 size:59% position:70%
And if we're acting
like jurors,

00:11:26.384 --> 00:11:28.320 size:63% position:69%
we want to make
the right decisions.

00:11:28.353 --> 00:11:30.255
As we very much learned today,

00:11:30.288 --> 00:11:33.992
the goal isn't to prove
one thing one way or the other.

00:11:34.025 --> 00:11:35.861
It's just to reduce
uncertainty...

00:11:35.894 --> 00:11:38.163
-That's correct.
-...in the most careful way.

00:11:38.196 --> 00:11:42.301
Absolutely. To know a little bit
more today than yesterday.

00:11:42.334 --> 00:11:43.869 align:end position:100%
[Jeff]
Yeah.

00:11:46.805 --> 00:11:48.140
[Michael]
Our pilot test shows

00:11:48.173 --> 00:11:49.975
that there's still a lot
to discover

00:11:50.008 --> 00:11:51.376
about terror management

00:11:51.409 --> 00:11:53.278
and many promising ways
to do it.

00:11:53.311 --> 00:11:56.315
I'm particularly intrigued
by our observation

00:11:56.348 --> 00:11:58.984
that for all
the closed-mindedness

00:11:59.017 --> 00:12:01.086
mortality salience
appears to cause,

00:12:01.119 --> 00:12:03.122
it also lead
to what looked like

00:12:03.155 --> 00:12:06.225
increased consideration
and thought.

00:12:06.258 --> 00:12:08.894
I'd love to see more research
on that idea.

00:12:08.927 --> 00:12:11.063
But the point is this:

00:12:11.096 --> 00:12:15.200
if death's effects
aren't all entirely bad,

00:12:15.233 --> 00:12:17.369
what if, instead of,

00:12:17.402 --> 00:12:19.938
or at least at the same time

00:12:19.971 --> 00:12:22.808
that we hope for the abolition
of natural death,

00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:26.912
we also find a way
to accept it?

00:12:26.945 --> 00:12:30.983
Now, obviously I don't
want to die, at least not soon.

00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:33.852
But accepting the inevitability
of my own death

00:12:33.885 --> 00:12:38.791
and being less afraid of it
feels powerful and honest.

00:12:38.824 --> 00:12:40.993
I'd like to learn
what that looks like.

00:12:41.026 --> 00:12:43.763
And I have a friend
who can help.

00:12:48.433 --> 00:12:50.536
<i> I'm paying a visit
 to Caitlin Doughty,</i>

00:12:50.569 --> 00:12:54.406
<i> a mortician, author,
and death positivity activist,</i>

00:12:54.439 --> 00:12:56.875
<i> who has made an entire career
 out of discussing</i>

00:12:56.908 --> 00:13:01.046
<i> the aspects of death that
 most of us prefer to ignore.</i>

00:13:01.079 --> 00:13:05.417 size:81% position:41% line:0%
What do you say to someone
who comes to you and says,

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:08.520
"I think death is terrifying.
It's...

00:13:08.553 --> 00:13:11.056
"so scary and sad

00:13:11.089 --> 00:13:13.992
that I'm just here now"?

00:13:14.025 --> 00:13:15.861 align:start size:66% position:34%
Is this person dying,
or is this person...?

00:13:15.894 --> 00:13:17.830
This person is me
in front of you right now.

00:13:17.863 --> 00:13:19.298 size:59% position:70%
This person is you.
Okay, so...

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:21.166 align:start size:50% position:50%
I would tell you
a couple things.

00:13:21.199 --> 00:13:26.071
First, you're dealing with
the primal existential quandary

00:13:26.104 --> 00:13:27.339
of human existence.

00:13:27.372 --> 00:13:30.075
-Yes.
-And you are one of, you know,

00:13:30.108 --> 00:13:32.978 size:84% position:58%
the many billions of people
who have felt this.

00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:35.280
So you're not alone
in feeling this way.

00:13:35.313 --> 00:13:37.516 align:start size:72% position:28%
So we go through life--
We reach a certain age,

00:13:37.549 --> 00:13:40.052 align:start size:81% position:19%
and we begin to understand

00:13:40.085 --> 00:13:44.189
that someday ourselves
and everyone we love will die.

00:13:44.222 --> 00:13:47.926 size:63% position:69%
And that's powerful,
painful knowledge.

00:13:47.959 --> 00:13:50.028
And I think from that moment,

00:13:50.061 --> 00:13:52.998 size:84% position:58%
We have to start developing
defense mechanisms

00:13:53.031 --> 00:13:56.368
to handle that and to integrate
that into our lives.

00:13:56.401 --> 00:13:58.303 size:81% position:41%
So, what are those defense
mechanisms?

00:13:58.336 --> 00:14:02.407
I think that the more obvious
ones would be having a child,

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.943 size:53% position:73%
writing a book,
making a TV show,

00:14:04.976 --> 00:14:06.945 size:53% position:73%
creating a legacy
of some kind.

00:14:06.978 --> 00:14:09.581 size:72% position:64%
But there's also a more
insidious version,

00:14:09.614 --> 00:14:11.483 align:start size:41% position:59%
which is war.

00:14:11.516 --> 00:14:13.185
Taking other countries.

00:14:13.218 --> 00:14:16.521
Being rich and being okay with
other people being poor.

00:14:16.554 --> 00:14:18.257 size:84% position:58%
I think those are all signs
of death denial.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.625 align:start size:59% position:41%
They're all saying,

00:14:19.658 --> 00:14:21.526 size:81% position:59%
"But I'm okay,
because I have this money,

00:14:21.559 --> 00:14:25.464
"or I have this power, or I have
these kind of dark impulses

00:14:25.497 --> 00:14:30.469
that allow me to say, at least
I can outrun death in that way."

00:14:30.502 --> 00:14:32.137 align:end position:100%
And, of course,
that's not true.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:33.572 align:start size:75% position:25%
No one can outrun death.

00:14:33.605 --> 00:14:36.441 size:81% position:59%
But you can trick yourself
into believing that.

00:14:36.474 --> 00:14:38.043 size:50% position:25%
So how would you
characterize

00:14:38.076 --> 00:14:40.979 size:75% position:38%
the Western relationship
to death?

00:14:41.012 --> 00:14:43.949 size:84% position:58%
Take America 150 years ago.

00:14:43.982 --> 00:14:47.286
If you were my husband
and you died,

00:14:47.319 --> 00:14:49.421
I would be entirely
in charge of you.

00:14:49.454 --> 00:14:51.089
I would wash your body.

00:14:51.122 --> 00:14:54.192
I would get the neighbor
to make a wooden coffin for you.

00:14:54.225 --> 00:14:57.596
We would put you in the coffin
and carry you on our shoulders,

00:14:57.629 --> 00:14:59.631
to the grave which someone
had dug themselves.

00:14:59.664 --> 00:15:01.266
-Right.
-It would have been

00:15:01.299 --> 00:15:03.669 size:84% position:58%
an entirely self-sufficient
process.

00:15:03.702 --> 00:15:07.039 size:88% position:56%
But what happened around
the turn of the 20th century

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:09.441 size:81% position:59%
is really three big things
in my mind.

00:15:09.474 --> 00:15:11.977
One, you had the rise
of hospitals.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.046
So people were no longer
dying at home.

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:15.948
You had the rise
of funeral homes,

00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:19.318
which means that we are now
outsourcing our death.

00:15:19.351 --> 00:15:21.286
The third one
is slaughterhouses.

00:15:21.319 --> 00:15:24.356
So all of a sudden,
all food production

00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:27.492
and the killing of animals
is also hidden as well.

00:15:27.525 --> 00:15:30.162 size:63% position:69%
And we live in
our suburban houses,

00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:32.130
where all those things
are outsourced.

00:15:32.163 --> 00:15:36.234
And it's just these layers and
layers of denial around death.

00:15:36.267 --> 00:15:40.672
But what does it mean
to accept death?

00:15:40.705 --> 00:15:44.209
I don't think that you ever
truly accept death.

00:15:44.242 --> 00:15:48.180
But I believe that the movement
toward accepting death

00:15:48.213 --> 00:15:51.116 size:63% position:69%
involves really true
self-awareness

00:15:51.149 --> 00:15:55.087 size:78% position:61%
about where you're hiding
your fears of death.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.991
That's where real awareness
and acceptance can come from.

00:15:59.024 --> 00:16:01.193
For me, the thing that's just
such a bummer about death

00:16:01.226 --> 00:16:02.494
is that I just am done.

00:16:02.527 --> 00:16:04.696
I don't get to continue
learning things

00:16:04.729 --> 00:16:07.099
and seeing what happens.

00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:10.068
And I'm just not part
of Earth anymore.

00:16:10.101 --> 00:16:13.305
Isn't death kind of what gives
you that passion,

00:16:13.338 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start size:75% position:25%
when you think about it?

00:16:14.672 --> 00:16:16.608 size:69% position:66%
Like, I love learning,
I love ideas.

00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:19.578
If you didn't have an end point,
are you going to come in here

00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:23.181
with all these cameras and do
the huge amount of legwork

00:16:23.214 --> 00:16:26.051
-that creating a show requires?
-No.

00:16:26.084 --> 00:16:28.387
No. Right. Because you're like,
"I don't know, maybe I'll do it

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.455
200 years from now."

00:16:30.488 --> 00:16:33.258
Whereas right now, you're taking
in information left and right,

00:16:33.291 --> 00:16:34.559
because you want
to produce content.

00:16:34.592 --> 00:16:37.029
You want to produce
exciting things

00:16:37.062 --> 00:16:38.597
and share with other people...

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:41.033
-Because this is my one chance.
-This is your one chance.

00:16:41.066 --> 00:16:45.170
The passion and the realness
to life comes from an ending.

00:16:45.203 --> 00:16:48.073
That's the great gift
that death gives us.

00:16:48.106 --> 00:16:51.243
What's an unhealthy relationship
to have to your own mortality?

00:16:51.276 --> 00:16:53.412 size:84% position:58%
The pursuit of immortality,

00:16:53.445 --> 00:16:55.814 align:end position:100%
and the pursuit of,
"I will stay alive

00:16:55.847 --> 00:16:58.683 size:84% position:58%
until I can upload my brain
into the cloud."

00:16:58.716 --> 00:17:00.185 align:start size:50% position:50%
That worries me.

00:17:00.218 --> 00:17:01.787 size:69% position:66%
The idea that everyone
is just allowed

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.489 align:end position:100%
to live forever
from here on out

00:17:04.522 --> 00:17:06.691
is not environmentally sensible.

00:17:06.724 --> 00:17:10.696
It's not-- You know, it's just
not a sensible position to take.

00:17:14.432 --> 00:17:16.301
[narrator]
<i> We are seeing the dawn</i>

00:17:16.334 --> 00:17:19.337
<i> of a new era
 of possibilities unfold</i>

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:21.139
<i> on planet Earth.</i>

00:17:21.172 --> 00:17:24.176
<i> What will our amazing world
 be like in, say, 80,</i>

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:27.279
<i> 100, or even 200 years
 from now?</i>

00:17:27.312 --> 00:17:29.281
<i> Wouldn't you like
 the possibility</i>

00:17:29.314 --> 00:17:31.349
<i> of finding out?</i>

00:17:31.382 --> 00:17:33.385
[Michael]
<i> To understand why some people</i>

00:17:33.418 --> 00:17:35.487
<i> feel like death shouldn't
 be inevitable,</i>

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.489
<i> I've come to Alcor,</i>

00:17:37.522 --> 00:17:40.192
<i> one of the world's leading
 life extension facilities.</i>

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:42.160
-Linda. Hi, I'm Michael.
-Hi, how are you?

00:17:42.193 --> 00:17:44.162
-Great to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

00:17:44.195 --> 00:17:46.631
-Welcome to Alcor.
-Thank you for having me here.

00:17:46.664 --> 00:17:48.633 line:0%
<i> I'm meeting Linda Chamberlin,</i>

00:17:48.666 --> 00:17:51.570
<i> who co-founded Alcor
 nearly 46 years ago.</i>

00:17:51.603 --> 00:17:53.472
So this facility that we are in
right now

00:17:53.505 --> 00:17:57.809
is where you both cryo-preserve
people and store them.

00:17:57.842 --> 00:18:02.114
[Linda]
Yes. We have 160 patients.

00:18:02.147 --> 00:18:04.449
-Wow.
-And we have

00:18:04.482 --> 00:18:08.553
eleven hundred
and ninety-something members.

00:18:08.586 --> 00:18:10.388
-It changes.
-And a member is someone

00:18:10.421 --> 00:18:12.757
-who is alive today but has...
-Alive today.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:15.727
They've made the arrangements
for this.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.897
Once they are cryo-preserved,
they become patients.

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:20.298 size:59% position:30%
You're using
the word "patient."

00:18:20.331 --> 00:18:21.500
-Yes.
-Okay.

00:18:21.533 --> 00:18:23.401 size:78% position:39%
Tell me about why you use
that word.

00:18:23.434 --> 00:18:27.239
For us, death is not something
which is like an on/off switch.

00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:30.175 size:88% position:56%
One second you're alive,
the next second you're dead.

00:18:30.208 --> 00:18:32.511
-Mm-hmm.
-What we are trying to do

00:18:32.544 --> 00:18:36.414 size:75% position:63%
is to slow down and stop
the dying process.

00:18:36.447 --> 00:18:38.316
[Michael]
<i> To become a patient at Alcor,</i>

00:18:38.349 --> 00:18:42.354
<i> first you have to pay
 between 80 and $200,000</i>

00:18:42.387 --> 00:18:44.456
<i> Then you have to die,</i>

00:18:44.489 --> 00:18:48.193
<i> or more specifically,
be pronounced clinically dead.</i>

00:18:48.226 --> 00:18:50.462
<i> This generally means
 that your heart and lungs</i>

00:18:50.495 --> 00:18:51.897
<i> have stopped functioning.</i>

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.499
<i> At that point,
 Alcor can begin their work.</i>

00:18:54.532 --> 00:18:56.835 size:84% position:42%
Now, there are two ways
that a person could sign up

00:18:56.868 --> 00:18:58.503 align:start position:0%
for this procedure.

00:18:58.536 --> 00:19:01.940
There's a whole-body patient,
or as a neuro.

00:19:01.973 --> 00:19:03.575 size:63% position:69%
Oh, and does "neuro"
just mean head?

00:19:03.608 --> 00:19:05.877
It means, yes,
the cephalon, actually,

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.713
which is all of the structures
down to about the clavicle.

00:19:08.746 --> 00:19:10.749
-Uh-huh.
-I'm a neuro.

00:19:10.782 --> 00:19:15.287
Everybody in my family,
who's now in stasis, is a neuro.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.688
-Really?
-Most of the people

00:19:16.721 --> 00:19:21.326 size:81% position:41%
who really understand
the technology are neuros.

00:19:21.359 --> 00:19:25.597
The primary reason that people
choose whole body is emotional.

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:28.200
-Of course.
-And they're not comfortable

00:19:28.233 --> 00:19:32.704
with the idea of their body
being removed and discarded.

00:19:32.737 --> 00:19:37.242
So let's say that our patient
is whole body.

00:19:37.275 --> 00:19:39.611
The moment the patient
is pronounced,

00:19:39.644 --> 00:19:40.979
they go into an ice bath.

00:19:41.012 --> 00:19:43.315
And this is just crushed ice.

00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:45.250
And it's water
in there as well.

00:19:45.283 --> 00:19:48.453
Their heart has started again
with a mechanical thumper.

00:19:48.486 --> 00:19:51.856
They're intubated, and their
lungs are functioning again.

00:19:51.889 --> 00:19:53.358
Being ventilated.

00:19:53.391 --> 00:19:55.727
Circulating the cooler
temperatures.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.729 size:69% position:66%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So you need the veins,

00:19:57.762 --> 00:19:59.531 size:84% position:58%
the arteries,
the vasculature, the heart.

00:19:59.564 --> 00:20:03.535
You need all of those continuing
to pump and circulate.

00:20:03.568 --> 00:20:05.704
[Linda]
This is our operating room.

00:20:05.737 --> 00:20:06.905
[Michael]
Wow.

00:20:06.938 --> 00:20:08.640
So basically,

00:20:08.673 --> 00:20:11.776
when the patient comes in
through the door there,

00:20:11.809 --> 00:20:16.314
they'll go into this specially
developed operating table.

00:20:16.347 --> 00:20:21.786
It is going to be circulating
nitrogen gas over them

00:20:21.819 --> 00:20:23.989
to help cool them externally.

00:20:24.022 --> 00:20:26.458
And if it's a whole-body
patient,

00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:29.728
then the surgeons
open the chest,

00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:33.598
and then we begin circulating
the organ transplant solution.

00:20:33.631 --> 00:20:35.667
[Michael]
<i> Once in the operating room,</i>

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.269
<i> the patient's blood
 is replaced</i>

00:20:37.302 --> 00:20:39.471
<i> with cooled organ
 transplant fluid</i>

00:20:39.504 --> 00:20:41.640
<i> and circulated
 through the vascular system</i>

00:20:41.673 --> 00:20:43.475
<i> to rapidly cool down
 the internal</i>

00:20:43.508 --> 00:20:45.443
<i> and external temperatures
 of the body.</i>

00:20:45.476 --> 00:20:47.712
<i> Just before the water
 within the body tissue</i>

00:20:47.745 --> 00:20:49.514
<i> reaches its freezing point,</i>

00:20:49.547 --> 00:20:52.017
<i> cryo-protective fluids
 are introduced.</i>

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:53.952
<i> These act like antifreeze,</i>

00:20:53.985 --> 00:20:55.954
<i> preventing the formation
 of ice crystals</i>

00:20:55.987 --> 00:20:58.390
<i> that could damage
 soft tissue.</i>

00:20:58.423 --> 00:21:01.726
<i> This is called
 the vitrification process.</i>

00:21:01.759 --> 00:21:04.296 size:59% position:30%
Now, say that it is
a neuro patient.

00:21:04.329 --> 00:21:07.499
-So they come in first here.
-Yup, their whole body.

00:21:07.532 --> 00:21:10.669
Right. The surgeons will do
the neuro separation first.

00:21:10.702 --> 00:21:12.871
-Okay, yeah, that makes sense.
-Separate the cephalon,

00:21:12.904 --> 00:21:16.041
which is all of the structures
down to about the clavicle.

00:21:16.074 --> 00:21:18.910
Bring it over here

00:21:18.943 --> 00:21:22.914 align:start size:75% position:25%
to this operating field.

00:21:24.349 --> 00:21:25.850
We'll wash the blood out.

00:21:25.883 --> 00:21:29.054
And we introduce the organ
transplant solution.

00:21:29.087 --> 00:21:32.857
I'm imagining
a person's cephalon,

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:34.559
essentially their head,
in here.

00:21:34.592 --> 00:21:36.728
I can see how it's going
to get clamped in.

00:21:36.761 --> 00:21:38.096
[Linda]
Yeah.

00:21:38.129 --> 00:21:40.699
[Michael]
That looks like, I'm sure,

00:21:40.732 --> 00:21:42.634
a crazy sci-fi movie.

00:21:42.667 --> 00:21:45.603
-But it really happens.
-It really happens.

00:21:45.636 --> 00:21:47.839
[Michael]
<i>After the vitrification process
 is complete,</i>

00:21:47.872 --> 00:21:49.941
<i> the patients are placed
 inside bags</i>

00:21:49.974 --> 00:21:52.410
<i> that are attached
 to open metal cases,</i>

00:21:52.443 --> 00:21:54.612
<i> which are then placed inside
 cylindrical tanks</i>

00:21:54.645 --> 00:21:58.016
<i> filled with liquid nitrogen,
 called dewars.</i>

00:21:58.049 --> 00:22:00.051 size:53% position:27%
So this is our
patient care bay.

00:22:00.084 --> 00:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
We have 159 patients.

00:22:02.153 --> 00:22:05.123
-In these tanks right here?
-In these tanks.

00:22:05.156 --> 00:22:08.960
There are approximately

00:22:08.993 --> 00:22:11.129
nine patients
in each one of these.

00:22:11.162 --> 00:22:14.799
Four whole bodies
and five neuros.

00:22:14.832 --> 00:22:17.869
This one right here

00:22:17.902 --> 00:22:21.539
is where my husband
is currently housed.

00:22:21.572 --> 00:22:23.007
-This one right here?
-Right.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.110
This is where Fred is
at the moment.

00:22:25.143 --> 00:22:29.447
My mother and my father-in-law
are...

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.782 align:start size:38% position:63%
in this one.

00:22:30.815 --> 00:22:32.917
[Michael]
Wow, it's so weird,

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:37.689
because I am right now
not in a graveyard.

00:22:37.722 --> 00:22:42.026
No. Alcor is very much
like an ambulance

00:22:42.059 --> 00:22:44.662 size:72% position:36%
taking their loved ones
to a hospital

00:22:44.695 --> 00:22:45.930 align:start position:0%
not down the street,

00:22:45.963 --> 00:22:48.400
-but a hospital in the future.
-Yeah.

00:22:48.433 --> 00:22:50.969
When technology
can help them.

00:22:51.002 --> 00:22:53.438
They're not being transported
through space,

00:22:53.471 --> 00:22:55.573
-but through time.
-Time.

00:22:55.606 --> 00:22:59.043
[Michael]<i> To see what drives
this time-traveling ambulance,</i>

00:22:59.076 --> 00:23:01.045
<i> I'm going to sit down
 with Max More,</i>

00:23:01.078 --> 00:23:05.784
<i> Alcor's CEO,
 and a future neuro patient.</i>

00:23:05.817 --> 00:23:08.787
So, Max, what's the status
of the technology needed

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.756
to revive cryo-preserved
specimens?

00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:13.591
-Are we getting closer?
-We are getting closer.

00:23:13.624 --> 00:23:14.926
It's going to be decades,
at least,

00:23:14.959 --> 00:23:17.762 size:75% position:38% line:0%
before we can bring back
whole human beings.

00:23:17.795 --> 00:23:21.966 size:88% position:44% line:0%
But we already cryo-preserve
eggs, sperm,

00:23:21.999 --> 00:23:23.201 size:81% position:41%
microbes of skin, corneas,

00:23:23.234 --> 00:23:25.003 size:63% position:31%
heart valves,
all kinds of things.

00:23:25.036 --> 00:23:27.439
So those are single tissues.
And we can reverse that process.

00:23:27.472 --> 00:23:29.541
-Mm-hmm.
-You move from that to an organ,

00:23:29.574 --> 00:23:30.975 size:81% position:41%
things get more difficult.

00:23:31.008 --> 00:23:34.446 size:84% position:42%
But we actually did an
experiment a few years ago.

00:23:34.479 --> 00:23:35.980
We took this little tiny worm.

00:23:36.013 --> 00:23:37.849
We used a certain chemical
so we'd learn that,

00:23:37.882 --> 00:23:39.784
oh, my food's over here
and not over here.

00:23:39.817 --> 00:23:41.085
And we cryo-preserved them.

00:23:41.118 --> 00:23:43.488
And then we just waited,
brought them back,

00:23:43.521 --> 00:23:44.989
and then we tested them.

00:23:45.022 --> 00:23:46.858
We were able to demonstrate
with the memory test

00:23:46.891 --> 00:23:48.626
that the ones that have received
the training

00:23:48.659 --> 00:23:50.094
retained that memory.

00:23:50.127 --> 00:23:51.596 size:75% position:38%
So it was the first time
any organism

00:23:51.629 --> 00:23:53.164 size:72% position:36%
we've proven to survive
with memory.

00:23:53.197 --> 00:23:55.800 size:81% position:41%
So now we're asking, okay,
what's the next step?

00:23:55.833 --> 00:23:58.603
Because whole organisms are
difficult to reverse right now.

00:23:58.636 --> 00:24:00.538
But step by step,
the more progress we can make,

00:24:00.571 --> 00:24:02.974
-the more convincing this is.
-Wow.

00:24:03.007 --> 00:24:04.909 size:56% position:72%
When it comes
to extending life,

00:24:04.942 --> 00:24:08.112
some questions come up, like,
"should people die?"

00:24:08.145 --> 00:24:11.716 size:63% position:69%
I know we don't like
the idea of death.

00:24:11.749 --> 00:24:13.751
-I know what you're getting at.
-But you lose something

00:24:13.784 --> 00:24:14.953 align:start size:75% position:25%
by getting rid of death.

00:24:14.986 --> 00:24:16.554 size:81% position:41%
Yeah, we'll lose something

00:24:16.587 --> 00:24:18.256 size:81% position:41%
like we lost something
when we got rid of slavery

00:24:18.289 --> 00:24:20.024 align:start position:0%
or smallpox.

00:24:20.057 --> 00:24:22.894 align:start position:0%
So I think people...

00:24:22.927 --> 00:24:25.730
people are tying themselves
in knots to rationalize death.

00:24:25.763 --> 00:24:27.499 size:47% position:23%
I believe that,
right now,

00:24:27.532 --> 00:24:29.501 size:88% position:44%
we're kind of in
this tragic situation where,

00:24:29.534 --> 00:24:31.236 size:63% position:31%
over time, hopefully
you kind of learn.

00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:32.670 size:88% position:44%
Your wisdom grows over time.

00:24:32.703 --> 00:24:34.072 align:start position:0%
At the same time,

00:24:34.105 --> 00:24:35.940 size:84% position:42%
your cognitive and physical
health is declining.

00:24:35.973 --> 00:24:38.209 size:72% position:36%
That really sucks.
That's a bad situation.

00:24:38.242 --> 00:24:40.144 size:88% position:44%
What if they both could keep
going up indefinitely?

00:24:40.177 --> 00:24:42.180
So you could live for hundreds
of years or longer,

00:24:42.213 --> 00:24:44.816 size:78% position:39%
and get smarter, and more
knowledgeable, and wiser.

00:24:44.849 --> 00:24:47.051 align:start position:0%
Hopefully more mature,
and have more foresight

00:24:47.084 --> 00:24:49.521
because you got a much longer
planning horizon.

00:24:49.554 --> 00:24:51.890
What we'll have is a world
of, I call, ultra-mature people,

00:24:51.923 --> 00:24:53.658 size:84% position:42%
which I think will actually
be a better world

00:24:53.691 --> 00:24:55.126 size:44% position:22%
than the one
we have today.

00:24:55.159 --> 00:24:57.795
And if they say, well--
And this comes up all the time.

00:24:57.828 --> 00:24:59.964
They say, "Well, death is what
gives life meaning."

00:24:59.997 --> 00:25:01.933 size:53% position:27%
Bullshit, okay?
If that was true,

00:25:01.966 --> 00:25:05.270
then would they also advocate
people who live to 90

00:25:05.303 --> 00:25:06.905 size:84% position:42%
should be killed off at 45?

00:25:06.938 --> 00:25:08.706 size:88% position:44%
Will that double the meaning
in their life?

00:25:08.739 --> 00:25:11.209
In fact, I think life gets more
meaning the longer you live,

00:25:11.242 --> 00:25:13.945 size:84% position:42%
because you can build
on what you've done before.

00:25:13.978 --> 00:25:16.080 size:88% position:44%
So if anything, it increases
the meaningfulness of life,

00:25:16.113 --> 00:25:17.682 align:start position:0%
in my view.

00:25:17.715 --> 00:25:19.951 size:75% position:63%
You're making me realize
that, in many ways,

00:25:19.984 --> 00:25:24.656 align:start size:78% position:22%
I am rationalizing death.

00:25:24.689 --> 00:25:27.692
I'm looking for ways
to excuse it and accept it.

00:25:27.725 --> 00:25:31.296
I don't think it's unhealthy
to accept that you are mortal.

00:25:31.329 --> 00:25:32.730 size:81% position:41%
Well, I have to accept it,

00:25:32.763 --> 00:25:34.265 size:81% position:41%
because I could get killed
at any time.

00:25:34.298 --> 00:25:35.900 size:84% position:42%
One thing I have to stress,

00:25:35.933 --> 00:25:37.669 size:50% position:25%
because every
article written,

00:25:37.702 --> 00:25:39.203 size:72% position:36%
they always have to use
the word "forever,"

00:25:39.236 --> 00:25:40.805 align:start position:0%
or "immortality."

00:25:40.838 --> 00:25:42.574
And that's not
on the table here.

00:25:42.607 --> 00:25:44.342
We're just offering a chance
for people to be revived

00:25:44.375 --> 00:25:45.910
when we've beaten aging.

00:25:45.943 --> 00:25:47.946 size:81% position:41%
And eventually something's
going to get you.

00:25:47.979 --> 00:25:49.781 size:66% position:33%
So we're not offering
immortality.

00:25:49.814 --> 00:25:52.183 size:88% position:44%
We're offering an unknown
extension of human lifespan.

00:26:01.959 --> 00:26:06.364
Do I think that someday we will
be able to cryonically freeze

00:26:06.397 --> 00:26:09.834
an entire person
and then revive them?

00:26:11.102 --> 00:26:12.270
Yes, I do.

00:26:12.303 --> 00:26:14.038
I believe that
cryopreservation

00:26:14.071 --> 00:26:16.674
will change the meaning
of death,

00:26:16.707 --> 00:26:19.143
and lead to breakthroughs
in medical technology

00:26:19.176 --> 00:26:21.980
that will improve
all of our lives.

00:26:22.013 --> 00:26:26.951
But do I want to extend my life
indefinitely?

00:26:26.984 --> 00:26:28.820
Well, on the one hand,

00:26:28.853 --> 00:26:30.989
obviously death
is a bummer.

00:26:31.022 --> 00:26:32.357
But on the other,

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.293
the universe managed fine
without me

00:26:35.326 --> 00:26:37.695
for billions of years.

00:26:37.728 --> 00:26:39.831
Am I really so important

00:26:39.864 --> 00:26:42.800
that it should never
not have me again?

00:26:42.833 --> 00:26:46.237
Should I be around
as long as possible?

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:50.709
Or do those who will come later
deserve their own world?

00:26:51.942 --> 00:26:54.946
Should I try
to extend my life?

00:26:54.979 --> 00:26:59.951
Or should I decide to die
when my time comes

00:26:59.984 --> 00:27:03.755
and return all this matter
I'm borrowing back to the world?

00:27:03.788 --> 00:27:06.357
Well, I don't think
there's a right answer.

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:09.661
It's a personal choice
we each get to make,

00:27:09.694 --> 00:27:11.362
and should be able to make.

00:27:11.395 --> 00:27:14.799
And I've been thinking
about it a lot.

00:27:18.936 --> 00:27:21.739
<i> So I'm going to speak again
 with my friend Caitlin,</i>

00:27:21.772 --> 00:27:25.843
<i> the mortician,
 to confront my own mortality.</i>

00:27:25.876 --> 00:27:27.712 size:78% position:61%
Well, Caitlin, thanks for
meeting with me again.

00:27:27.745 --> 00:27:29.681 size:63% position:69%
I've been surrounded
by death lately.

00:27:29.714 --> 00:27:31.783 size:50% position:75%
Spoke to you.
I visited Alcor.

00:27:31.816 --> 00:27:33.818 align:start size:44% position:56%
And, you know,

00:27:33.851 --> 00:27:36.387
if we never invented technology
to bring people back,

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.823
then the Alcor patients
are dead.

00:27:38.856 --> 00:27:41.392
But they have that hope.

00:27:41.425 --> 00:27:44.028
I worked on
Terror Management Theory.

00:27:44.061 --> 00:27:47.465
And I even had a loved one
pass away just two weeks ago.

00:27:47.498 --> 00:27:51.069
-My grandmother.
-Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

00:27:51.102 --> 00:27:54.238
She was cremated,
as was my father.

00:27:54.271 --> 00:27:56.307 align:start size:78% position:22%
And I realized, you know,

00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:00.412
I've never made a clear decision
about what should happen to me.

00:28:01.879 --> 00:28:03.815 align:start size:69% position:31%
Because I just figured

00:28:03.848 --> 00:28:05.183 size:63% position:69%
I'll figure that out
when I'm older.

00:28:05.216 --> 00:28:07.151
-But I could die at any time.
-You sure could.

00:28:07.184 --> 00:28:09.253 align:start size:78% position:22%
So I want to be prepared.

00:28:09.286 --> 00:28:11.189
And I want my wishes
to be known.

00:28:11.222 --> 00:28:13.458
-Yeah.
-So I have decided

00:28:13.491 --> 00:28:15.126
when that moment comes,

00:28:15.159 --> 00:28:19.230
I want it to be my final moment
of existence.

00:28:19.263 --> 00:28:22.800
I want to give all my atoms and
molecules back to the universe.

00:28:22.833 --> 00:28:25.770
And I've decided that
I want to die.

00:28:25.803 --> 00:28:27.872
Oh, I'm so glad
you've made that decision.

00:28:27.905 --> 00:28:29.140
And you've come
to the right place.

00:28:29.173 --> 00:28:33.111
I want to be naturally buried.

00:28:33.144 --> 00:28:34.779
I want to have a green burial.

00:28:34.812 --> 00:28:37.849 size:81% position:59%
You know, become worm food
and plant food.

00:28:37.882 --> 00:28:39.417 size:63% position:69%
I want it all
to go back to earth.

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:43.287
But I kind of want a place
where people can come

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:46.891
to be like,
that's where he was buried.

00:28:46.924 --> 00:28:52.063
So there's everything from
just little discs in the ground

00:28:52.096 --> 00:28:54.465 size:75% position:38%
where you are,
to GPS that locates you,

00:28:54.498 --> 00:28:56.501 align:start position:0%
to natural cemeteries

00:28:56.534 --> 00:28:58.503
that are trying to reintroduce
native plants.

00:28:58.536 --> 00:29:00.204
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-So, you know,

00:29:00.237 --> 00:29:02.440 size:66% position:33%
you can have your own
Joshua tree.

00:29:02.473 --> 00:29:05.476
So the first thing I'm going
to give you to give a look over

00:29:05.509 --> 00:29:07.278
is what's called
an advanced directive.

00:29:07.311 --> 00:29:08.880
-Okay.
-And everybody needs

00:29:08.913 --> 00:29:10.381 align:start position:0%
to have one of these.

00:29:10.414 --> 00:29:14.318
And why it's so important
is that it's you

00:29:14.351 --> 00:29:17.922
not only designating someone
to be in charge of your body

00:29:17.955 --> 00:29:20.291
as you're dying,
right after you die,

00:29:20.324 --> 00:29:22.894
and then with however you decide
to dispose of it.

00:29:22.927 --> 00:29:25.163
But also who that person is.

00:29:25.196 --> 00:29:29.066
So this isn't just about burial.
This is dying.

00:29:29.099 --> 00:29:30.902
It's about death, dying,
death and after death.

00:29:30.935 --> 00:29:32.136
-Interesting.
-Mm-hmm.

00:29:32.169 --> 00:29:33.337
[Michael]
<i> A choice like this</i>

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:35.072
<i> is extremely new to humans.</i>

00:29:35.105 --> 00:29:38.810
<i>It used to be your only options
 upon death</i>

00:29:38.843 --> 00:29:42.547
<i> were cremation, embalming,
 or rotting away.</i>

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:46.284
<i> But today, you can chose to
pause yourself at death's door</i>

00:29:46.317 --> 00:29:49.086
<i> until the door has been moved
 somewhere else.</i>

00:29:49.119 --> 00:29:52.190
<i> But I've decided
 not to do that.</i>

00:29:52.223 --> 00:29:54.358 size:78% position:61%
So I'm ready to make this
official.

00:29:54.391 --> 00:29:56.528
-Fire in the hole.
-Okay.

00:29:59.563 --> 00:30:01.833
-Whoo! All right.
-How do you feel?

00:30:01.866 --> 00:30:04.602 size:69% position:66%
Weirdly, I feel
very relaxed and good.

00:30:04.635 --> 00:30:07.171
It was kind of life-changing,
but what it really was

00:30:07.204 --> 00:30:09.240
was death-changing.

00:30:09.273 --> 00:30:11.342
Ha, well, thank you, and
I'm glad you've decided to die.

00:30:11.375 --> 00:30:12.977 align:start size:31% position:69%
Thank you.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:14.912
<i> Jeff and Sheldon,</i>

00:30:14.945 --> 00:30:17.882
<i> thank you for showing me
the power of death's influence.</i>

00:30:17.915 --> 00:30:20.585
<i> Caitlin, thank you
 for helping me accept it.</i>

00:30:20.618 --> 00:30:22.887
<i> Max, thank you for the work
 you are doing</i>

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.189
<i> and the opportunities
 you are offering humanity.</i>

00:30:25.222 --> 00:30:29.961
<i> And, all you out there,
as always, thanks for watching.</i>
