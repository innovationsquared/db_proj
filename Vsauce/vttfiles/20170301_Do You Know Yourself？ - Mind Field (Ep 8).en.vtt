00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:14.180
but who are you?

00:00:14.213 --> 00:00:16.382
Do you even know who you are?

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:18.217
<i> Are you your memories?</i>

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.619
- I don't remember that.

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:21.287
- I don't remember that at all.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.222
<i>- Are you the choices you make?</i>

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:25.224
The focus tester

00:00:25.257 --> 00:00:27.360

00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:28.628 align:end position:100%
- That's scary.
[chuckles]

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.663
<i> - Or are you your past?</i>

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:34.233 size:88% position:44%
- I hit the back of my head
and I forgot my entire life.

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.369 align:start position:0%
Just like you hit

<i> ♪ ♪</i>

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:52.752
Have you ever looked
at a photograph of yourself

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:55.455
and thought,
"That's what I look like?

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:56.656
Ugh."

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:58.691 line:0%
We often think we look bad

00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:01.094 line:0%
or not right in photos

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:04.497 line:0%
because photos show us
what we really look like

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.232
to other people.

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:08.734
The you that
you're used to seeing

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:11.270
is mirror you.

00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:14.774
Every mirror you look into
reverses your face.

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:17.176
Most selfie cameras do this too,

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:20.613
so we tend to prefer
that version of ourselves.

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:22.648
If you wanna see yourself
in a mirror

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:24.784
the way other people see you
in real life,

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:26.319
take two mirrors

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:28.821
and position them
at a 90-degree angle.

00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:32.191
What you see won't be
yourself reversed,

00:01:32.224 --> 00:01:34.427
but how you look in real life.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.629
<i> So who would you say
 you are really?</i>

00:01:36.662 --> 00:01:38.698
<i> Is it how you look?</i>

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:39.799
<i> Or is it how you dress?</i>

00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:42.702
<i> Or are you the atoms
 that make you up?</i>

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:45.905
Because all of those things
change throughout your life.

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:47.707
Ah, maybe
the real common thread,

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.509
that which doesn't change,

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:51.210
is your history,

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:52.645

00:01:55.314 --> 00:01:57.850 line:0%
from the way
they actually happened.

00:01:57.883 --> 00:02:01.721
Does that mean
we don't know ourselves?

00:02:04.823 --> 00:02:06.492
False memories are

00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:09.729
frighteningly easy to create.

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:11.397
Today, we're gonna make some,

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.199
and we're gonna have
a little fun doing it.

00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:15.668
We have created a fake game show

00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:17.570
called "Who You Were."

00:02:17.603 --> 00:02:19.739
We're gonna bring contestants
down memory lane

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:21.908
and have them tell us
about their past.

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.877
<i> Some of which we're going
 to completely make up.</i>

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.847
We're gonna plant a few
little seeds in this mind field

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.382
and see if we can grow

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:32.152

00:02:57.843 --> 00:02:59.278 align:end position:100%

a taste of your life.

00:03:00.946 --> 00:03:03.282
- Oh, my God, let's take a look.

00:03:03.315 --> 00:03:05.418 align:end position:100%
- So Tim was raised
in California

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:06.953 align:end position:100%
where he and his parents
owned and operated

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:08.387
a Thai food restaurant.
- [laughing]

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.556

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:16.829
