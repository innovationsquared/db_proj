00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.729
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. I've been watching
Bravest Warriors on Cartoon Hangover lately.

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:11.580
It's great, it was created by Pendleton Ward,
and in the show teenagers zip around the universe

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:20.480
visiting star systems and planets and here
is my question: When will we do the same?

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.640
Us humans, in real life.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.460
I mean, we've managed to put people on the
Moon, and land robots on asteroids, and Mars,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.000
and even Titan, a moon of Saturn.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:41.160
Interplanetary travel is scary cool.
But will we ever travel interstellarly? Certainly

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.899
it will happen, right? I mean, Voyager 1 is
expected to reach interstellar space sometime

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:55.579
this year, or maybe in the next year or two.
And it was launched way back in 1977. So,

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.329
shows like Bravest Warriors are pretty much
just a glimpse of our future, maybe even one

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.169
within our lifetimes. Right?

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.960
Well, we're going to need a DONG for this one. Something you

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.200
can Do Online Now Guys.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.920
The Hayden Planetarium's digital universe
allows you to explore a 3-dimensional map

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.420
of our Milky Way. Now, there are about 81
visible stars within just 20 lightyears of

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.980
our own Sun. The nearest is Proximus Centauri,
which is only 4.3 lightyears away.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:42.300
Getting there? Piece of cake. Piece of difficult
cake, because a lightyear is an incredibly

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.500
long distance. It's the distance that light
in a vacuum will travel in an entire year.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.420
And in just one second light can travel
so far as to circle the entire Equator of

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.560
Earth...7 times.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:08.819
Now, a fast bullet can travel at about 1,500 m/s.
And Voyager 1 is traveling at about 17,000

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.169
m/s, relative to the Sun. Also relative to
the Sun, our Earth is orbiting at a speed

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:23.989
of 29,800 m/s - that's pretty fast.
But the fastest man-made object ever was the Helios

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:32.140
2 Solar Probe,
which traveled at a maximum speed of 70,220 m/s.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:40.640
Impressive, right? Well, even at that speed,
the fastest speed ever reached by any man

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.980
made object, crossing this little ol' gap
and reaching Proximus Centauri would take

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.640
19,000 years.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.400
But technology in the future is bound to be
improved, along with the maximum speeds we

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.180
are able to obtain. Even using what we know
now, a solar sail could easily provide the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.180
acceleration needed to reach near-lightspeed speeds.
And our current understanding of physics theoretically

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:15.930
allows for things like wormholes which, in
theory, could move a spacecraft from one point

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.029
in space to another faster than light normally could.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.440
And who could forget the famous Alcubierre drive?
An idea that fits within most models

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:31.999
of our universe, and proposes a way to deliver
a space craft to a distant object faster than

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:38.999
light can get there - not by moving the spacecraft,
but, instead, by collapsing and expanding

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.300
space itself.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.100
Things like wormholes and Alcubierre drives
are theoretical, but if they could one day

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:54.949
become a reality, how far away might that day be?
It matters. And figuring out exactly

00:03:54.949 --> 00:04:02.199
when in time we should begin an interstellar
journey is called a Wait Calculation. Leave

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:09.379
too soon and before a ship launched today,
full of frozen embryos, ever got to its destination

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:15.309
it would be passed by astronauts who left
hundreds, or thousands, of years later, at

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:21.449
a point in time when technology was advanced
enough to lap what we have today.

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:26.770
Andrew Kennedy calculated that given the
pace of our progress, as far as travel velocity

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.009
is concerned,
and Earth's mean annual economic growth,

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:37.289
the soonest human civilization might ever
reach Bernard Star, 6 lightyears away, is

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:48.039
1,104 years from today, which isn't within
any of our lifetimes. It might also be a bit

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:53.349
optimistic because it assumes that we not
only solve the problem of speed, but that

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:58.689
we also solve problems like "how to survive
interstellar radiation for years?" or "how

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:03.360
to avoid collisions with interstellar
material at high speeds?"

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.199
It also assumes that before we achieve the
technology needed to successfully interstellarly

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:17.479
travel, all of human kind isn't wiped out
by some cataclysmic natural disaster. It may

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.699
sound unlikely, but we're not talking about
the near-future, we're talking about thousands

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:29.859
of years from now. Let's put it this way.
Even given our current, slow means of space

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:37.000
travel, it's estimated that within 5 to 50 million
years, we could theoretically explore and

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:39.049
colonize our whole galaxy.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:46.460
That's a lot of time, though. In fact, statistically
speaking, within the next 500,000 years, it's

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:54.280
very likely that Earth will encounter a meteorite
nearly a kilometer across. Hopefully when

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.349
that happens we have the prevention abilities
needed to keep ourselves safe. But given

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:06.669
all of this information it's easy to see why
the 2008 Joint Propulsion Conference concluded

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:13.669
that it was improbable that humans would ever
explore beyond the solar system.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:20.319
It's quite depressing to think that scenes
like this one from Shutterstock may be destined

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:24.739
to only ever remain that - science fiction.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.040
Wait, how quickly is the camera moving in

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:36.509
that clip? We're used to seeing science fiction
scenes like this, but a Nebula tends to be

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:41.330
lightyears across, which means that in this
clip we're traveling at least the speed of

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.080
light, if not faster.
Would it really look like that?

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:52.469
I covered this briefly in my black hole video,
but not completely. If you were to travel

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:58.330
at the speed of light, or near the speed of
light, the universe ahead of you wouldn't

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:03.990
look like it usually did. First of all, your
field of view would increase. It would appear

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:10.319
as if the universe was receding away from
you as you accelerated. At the same time,

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:16.560
all of the light reaching you would be blueshifted
until you were left with this. You may have

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:22.849
seen this on Vsauce 2. It's the cosmic background
radiation blueshifted all-the-way up into

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:25.069
the visible range.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:31.539
MIT Game Lab offers a free, downloadable game
that puts you in an environment where the

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:38.029
speed of light can be lowered all-the-way
down to typical walking speed. You can experience

00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:43.039
all of the visual effects I just discussed,
but I wanted to know what it would look like

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:48.189
if the speed of light was where it is, and
I took a journey from Earth to the Moon.

00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:53.849
So, I enlisted my friend Liam from World of
the Orange and New Music to put together a

00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:59.909
simulation of what it might actually look
like to accelerate to nearly the speed of

00:07:59.909 --> 00:08:06.069
light and then slow down,
during a trip from Earth to the Moon. Enjoy.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.419
Whether or not you should believe that all
the right factors will come together and humans

00:08:16.419 --> 00:08:22.830
will one day travel that quickly or reach
interstellar destinations largely comes down

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:28.059
to whether you want to be an optimist or a
pessimist. But what we've accomplished so

00:08:28.059 --> 00:08:35.599
far is quite amazing considering how weak,
flimsy and vulnerable the human body is in

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:37.819
the vacuum of space.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:43.380
Bad Astronomer and SciShow have great videos
discussing this topic. And now, thanks to

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:51.140
the brilliant team at Bravest Warriors, I'm
going to go to space. But not while wearing

00:08:51.149 --> 00:08:58.289
a Vsauce suit, no, no, no, I'll do it naked.
Whoa. Ok, not that naked. And also maybe some

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:01.199
muscles?
Yep, so that's pretty much what I'd look like.

00:09:01.199 --> 00:09:06.740
The moment I'm exposed to the vacuum of space
my body would not inflate and explode. Now,

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:13.610
the body is a very nicely contained system.
But those parts of me that aren't well contained...they'll

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:20.570
be the first to go. The air in my lungs and
digestive tract would quickly rush out. Moist,

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:26.120
soft tissues would rapidly lose water.
My mouth and lips and eyes would dry out and

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.540
swell. As water was pulled to the surface
of these things it would vaporize, and the

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:36.089
decrease in its pressure would cool my mouth
and eyes to near-freezing. My body would inflate

00:09:36.089 --> 00:09:42.870
to about twice its normal size as gasses in
my blood came out of solution, slowly evaporating

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:48.269
away, cooling the surface of my skin.
Oh, and the blood vessels in my eyes would likely

00:09:48.269 --> 00:09:52.639
burst, spilling blood into my eyes which,
along with all the other fluid in my eyes,

00:09:52.639 --> 00:09:57.529
would be rapidly vaporizing on the surface,
freezing and drying them out.

00:09:57.529 --> 00:10:03.509
Within about 15 seconds I would go unconscious
because oxygen wasn't reaching my brain. And,

00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:09.130
as far as I'm concerned, that would be the
end of the entire ordeal. For another 90 seconds

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:15.420
or so I would still, technically, be alive,
but I wouldn't be aware of it or remember

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:22.680
any of it. My dead body would remain, internally,
quite warm for a while because in the near

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:28.790
vacuum of space there isn't much matter to
conduct of convect heat away from me. Instead,

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:35.160
I would really only lose heat through radiation,
a much less efficient method. It would take

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.620
hours for me to cool down to the temperature
of space, and by then, I would be nothing

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:46.620
but a dried-up piece of slightly bloated and
stretched, dessicated human jerky.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:52.800
If I was exposed to the Sun's full-on radiation,
not filtered by the usual atmosphere of Earth,

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:57.139
I would be a grossly sunburnt piece of jerky.

00:10:57.139 --> 00:11:02.550
In case that makes you hungry, let me give
you some nutritional facts: 200 pounds of

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:09.550
human meat, in outer space, would eventually
become about 120 pounds of freeze-dried jerky.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:16.480
And given what would be left of me that would
be edible as a snack, I'd be worth about 115,000

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.470
calories.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:24.750
Maybe humans are the only intelligent life
in the universe. But if you believe that intelligent

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:32.310
life could have arisen on other planets,
an interesting idea occurs: The Fermi Paradox.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:38.620
Enrico Fermi calculated that given the number
of planets believed to exist in our galaxy,

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:44.300
at least some of them must have been habitable
to life as we know it. And, in many cases,

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.750
millions and millions of years before life
on Earth even existed.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:54.079
So, if interstellar travel, traveling between
stars and different solar systems, really

00:11:54.079 --> 00:12:04.999
is possible for intelligent life to do, why
have we not been visited by aliens yet? Well,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.069
maybe we have been visited. Maybe they're
here right now and we just can't perceive

00:12:09.069 --> 00:12:18.220
them. Or maybe we haven't been discovered.
Or maybe we are alone. Or maybe we're just

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.060
not worth visiting...

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:26.529
So, what are you waiting for? Live your life
in a way that makes traveling lightyears just

00:12:26.529 --> 00:12:29.389
to hang out with you worth it.

00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:30.329
And as always,

00:12:30.329 --> 00:12:31.529
thanks for watching.
