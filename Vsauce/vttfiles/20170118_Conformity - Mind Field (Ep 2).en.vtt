It wasn't their responsibility,

- No, I felt relaxed,
so I don't get--

00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:17.976
I can't figure it--
I still feel relaxed.

00:21:18.009 --> 00:21:19.511 align:start position:0%
- Are you surprised
to have heard

00:21:19.544 --> 00:21:21.780 size:81% position:41%
that you just drank water?

00:21:21.813 --> 00:21:22.914
- Yeah.

00:21:22.947 --> 00:21:25.583
I definitely feel different.

00:21:25.616 --> 00:21:27.686
- I actually did hear,
yeah, an echo.

00:21:27.719 --> 00:21:30.622
<i> - The desire to conform
 is so strong,</i>

00:21:30.655 --> 00:21:32.490
<i> the subjects continue
 to believe</i>

00:21:32.523 --> 00:21:34.392

00:21:34.425 --> 00:21:36.628

 the drug was fake.</i>

- I am prone to
anxiety attacks, though,

00:21:38.596 --> 00:21:40.098 align:start size:56% position:44%
so I felt relaxed.

00:21:40.131 --> 00:21:42.334 align:start position:0%
- Well, you should take
more of this nothing.

00:21:42.367 --> 00:21:44.303
[laughter]

00:21:47.105 --> 00:21:50.442
Human society is
incredibly complex.

00:21:50.475 --> 00:21:53.812
<i> And the dueling forces
 pushing us to conform</i>

00:21:53.845 --> 00:21:56.715
<i> and also to express
 our individuality</i>

00:21:56.748 --> 00:21:58.516
<i> are both necessary.</i>

00:21:58.549 --> 00:22:01.820
<i> Other people can influence us
 in good ways</i>

00:22:01.853 --> 00:22:04.022
<i> and in not-so-good ways.</i>

00:22:04.055 --> 00:22:05.490
<i> But at the end of the day,</i>

00:22:05.523 --> 00:22:07.058
just remember this:

00:22:07.091 --> 00:22:10.062
what did the walrus
say to the doctor?

00:22:11.596 --> 00:22:13.765
Give up?

00:22:13.798 --> 00:22:15.100
Cardboard.

00:22:17.435 --> 00:22:19.404
Go ahead, laugh.

00:22:19.437 --> 00:22:21.106
Everyone's doing it.

00:22:21.139 --> 00:22:24.008
You don't want to look like
you don't get it, do you?

00:22:24.041 --> 00:22:25.643
Good, that's what I thought.

00:22:25.676 --> 00:22:26.978
Thanks for laughing,

00:22:27.011 --> 00:22:28.446
and as always,

00:22:28.479 --> 00:22:29.614
thanks for watching.
