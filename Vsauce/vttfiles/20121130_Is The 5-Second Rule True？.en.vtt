Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And bananas are fantastic. They're actually one of the most

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.990
radioactive foods we regularly eat. Sometimes
they're difficult to peel from the top. One

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.109
of my favorite ways to avoid that is to simply
hold the banana and snap it in half. Boom,

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:24.109
now it peels itself. It's a wonderful little
trick, except when you drop it on the ground.

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.660
This is unfortunate, but if it picked it
up quickly, would it be safe enough to eat?

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.579
I mean, how quickly do the bacteria on the
floor move onto the food? Some people call

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.599
it the "5-Second Rule." Others, the "10-Second
Rule." And still, others, the "2-Second Rule."

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.140
But is there any truth to it, or is it just
something we say to allow us to eat food off

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.269
the floor?

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:55.699
In 2003, Jillian Clarke famously investigated
this question. She found that 50% of men use

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:04.199
the 5-Second Rule to eat food off the ground.
But 70% of women do. More importantly, she

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.259
found that even brief contact with a contaminated
floor will contaminate food, wet or dry.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.660
The Myth Busters found similar results.
And a paper published in the Journal of Applied

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.040
Microbiology got even more technical.
The researchers contaminated various floor surfaces

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:28.300
with salmonella and they found that 5 seconds
is way too long to wait. Bacteria adhere to

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.940
dropped food almost immediately, but time
does matter. After 5 seconds, they found that

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.229
the food had acquired anywhere from 150 to 8000 bacteria. But if left for a full minute,

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.340
the number they found was 10 times greater.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.259
Now considering it only takes about 10 bacteria
of certain strains of salmonella to infect

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.189
you, you should probably think twice 
before eating off the ground.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.700
Oh, and don't complacently think that you're
safe because the floor looks clean or the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.100
food that fell on it does. Floors make great
homes for bacteria. Also, floors come in

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.660
contact with the bottoms of our shoes
and the University of Arizona has found that 93%

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.840
of our shoes are contaminated with fecal bacteria.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.090
I've linked all of these studies down in the
description. They're great reads, very thorough.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:30.170
But is it true that food dropped on a dirty
floor becomes contaminated immediately?

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.480
I mean, sure, practically speaking, that makes
a lot of sense. But instantly? Is there a

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.540
limit to how quickly bacteria can move from
one object to another? Is there an amount

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.160
of time, short enough, that were I to pick
the food up within it, there would be no way

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.379
for what it touched to contaminate it.

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:58.179
Well, we're going to need to define "touch."
I've talked about this before on Vsauce and

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.129
on Thinker and MinutePhysics has a great
quantum perspective, but when we say "touch,"

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:11.849
we tend to think of two objects contacting
each other with no space in between. Unfortunately,

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:18.660
that's not really what happens. At a subatomic
level, atoms resist smashing together because

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:26.190
their electrons repel. Electrons can be modeled
as waves, waves that overlap and interact,

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.720
but they never touch. There's always space
between them. When I touch something or someone,

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.570
I'm really just feeling their electrons react
to mine at a distance. A sub-atomically small

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.500
one, but a real one.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.019
So, if that's the case, how come glue can
stick things together? How come lipstick sticks

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:54.260
to lips? And how can bacteria on a dirty floor
stick to food that's been dropped on it?

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.860
The positive charge from the protons in an
atom or molecule isn't always balanced perfectly

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.560
in space by the negative charge from electrons.
Sometimes, a molecule is asymmetrical and this

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.040
imbalance is permanent, which gives the molecule
a constant dipole, so it's like a tiny little

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.930
magnet.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.940
But even in symmetrical molecules, electrons
are mobile. At any one point in time they

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.250
might happen to find themselves more towards
one end of the molecule than the other, creating

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:30.550
rapidly fluctuating dipoles,
causing the molecule to act like a magnet.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.580
If molecules have a lot of energy, they will
simply whiz by one another and their dipoles

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.860
and those of their neighbors won't matter much.
But if you cool them down, slow them

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.970
down, the dipoles will have more of an effect,
which is why molecules tend to stick together

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.390
as they cool - going from a gas to a liquid to a solid.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.800
That's a lot of information about molecules,
but it's incredibly important. It's the reason

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.190
things can get wet. In fact, when you get
out of the shower, you, on average, weigh

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.990
about one more pound more than you did before
you got wet. It's also the reason Capillary

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:14.770
Action happens. If you dip a napkin in a glass
of water, you can watch the water climb up the napkin

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.340
against gravity. That's because the molecules
of water have very strong dipoles and they're

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.590
attracted to each other - cohesion - and they're
attracted to molecules of the paper - adhesion -

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.250
more strongly than gravity pulls them down.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.250
If you want to learn more about intermolecular
forces, I've put a bunch of links down in

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:40.600
the description. But here's my question: how
quickly do those forces act? Can two surfaces

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:46.680
come into contact, briefly enough, that their
molecules don't have time to be influenced

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.690
by intermolecular forces?

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.900
Well, for this, we're going to need Molecular Dynamics.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:00.780
Molecular Dynamics is the computer simulation
of the physical movements of atoms or molecules.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:07.180
For instance, this is a simulation of a single
copper atom depositing on a copper surface.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:13.520
Notice that the timer up there is counting
off hundredths of a picosecond. These simulations

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.699
need to have a narrow enough time-step to
account for the fastest molecular vibrations

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:24.319
of the material,
including everything from wagging to scissoring.

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:30.659
Typically, time as brief as a quadrillionth
of a second is taken into account. So, the

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:39.699
5-second rule may be true. If we rename it
the "1 Femtosecond Rule." Spend less time

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:43.710
on the floor than that and it's unlikely
that room temperature molecules would have

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:51.830
time to be influenced by intermolecular forces.
Except, oops, I think we've been thinking

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:57.450
too small. Intermolecular forces are fun,
but objects can become entangled with each

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.820
other on a macroscopic level.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:06.160
Glue and make-up and other sticky stuff often
take advantage of the tiny imperfections -

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:12.340
ridges and nooks and crannies - on an object's
surface. Sticky things can seep inside and

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:17.780
hold on. Even surfaces that seem smooth to
us, when you really get down to it, aren't

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.060
smooth at all.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:24.280
Two sheets of paper from a phonebook may slide
across each other quite easily, but multiply

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:29.610
that friction by the number of pages in two
phonebooks by interweaving the pages and

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.510
you've got yourself a monster
capable of lifting an entire car.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.840
I was recently lucky enough to see this happen
in real life. You can check out my adventure

00:07:39.849 --> 00:07:44.360
over on Fast, Furious &amp; Funny. It's a new
channel. Stay tuned, because we lifted cars

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.700
with more than just phonebooks.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.780
The adhesion between two objects caused by
the shapes of their surfaces contributes to

00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:59.080
friction and is known as "mechanical adhesion."
It plays a pretty big role in getting floor

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.770
germs to sick to dropped food.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:08.000
In fact, if two surfaces can mechanically
adhere, but aren't close enough to do so,

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:12.780
we wouldn't say they were touching. And so,
if by definition "touching" means that you

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:18.870
can mechanically adhere to other object's surface,
well, then maybe the 5-Second Rule shouldn't

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:23.940
be known as the "1 Femtosecond Rule,"
because if they're touching, it's already too late

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:29.129
and instead the rule should be known as
the "Don't Touch Food That's Fallen on the

00:08:29.129 --> 00:08:31.109
Floor Rule."

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:37.200
But come to think of it, maybe we shouldn't
be eating food that's touched anything, because

00:08:37.209 --> 00:08:43.990
bacteria are everywhere, including on you
right now. There are more bacteria on your

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:49.050
body right now than there are people living in America.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:56.780
There are 40 million bacteria in one gram
of soil and 5 nonillion bacteria on Earth.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:03.899
It's been found that one out of every 10 bank
cards, and one out of every 7 bills, has fecal

00:09:03.899 --> 00:09:05.639
bacteria on it.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:11.140
Here's something fun. Go down to the comment
section and type the letter "V." If you used

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:18.760
a mobile phone to do that, congratulations,
you just touched 6,281 bacteria. If you're

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:23.320
using a desktop keyboard, you're a little
safer. You probably only touched about 180.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:28.240
Cellphones are actually one of the most bacteria-ridden
things we frequently encounter.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:33.060
If you want to estimate about how many bacteria
are specifically on your phone, based on how

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:37.970
clean you are, The Oatmeal has a really great
quiz. You can find that in the description.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:44.240
But honestly what amazes me the most isn't
how dirty our world is, or how much bacteria

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:51.250
there is; instead, it's the fact that despite
those numbers, we don't get sick more often.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:58.840
Our immune system is amazing, but it relies
on the same principles of adhesion that bacteria do.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:05.220
The forces that cause food dropped on the
floor to pick up germs are the same forces

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:10.589
that we need to fight them. They're same forces
that bring us closer together, whether we

00:10:10.589 --> 00:10:11.550
like it or not.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.050
So, keep adhering.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.030
And as always,

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.560
thanks for watching.
