00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.717
This is Inuyama, Japan,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.485
a historic city

00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:22.488
home to Japan's oldest
original wooden castle.

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:25.525
It is also home
to Kyoto University's

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:27.494
Primate Research Institute.

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:35.468
<i> Here, a group of chimpanzees
 have been trained</i>

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:39.505
<i> to play a game that exposes
 something shocking</i>

00:00:39.538 --> 00:00:41.274
<i> about their memories.</i>

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:42.675
<i> This is going
 to blow your mind.</i>

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:44.210
<i> Here is how it works.</i>

00:00:44.243 --> 00:00:46.412
<i> Take a look at these numbers.</i>

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:48.214
<i> 1, 2, 3.</i>

00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:49.749
<i> Remember where they are,</i>

00:00:49.782 --> 00:00:51.384
<i> because they're about
 to disappear.</i>

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:54.620
<i> Can you point to where
 each number used to be</i>

00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:56.322
<i> in numerical order?</i>

00:00:56.355 --> 00:00:57.790
<i> Probably. It's pretty easy.</i>

00:00:57.823 --> 00:00:59.292
<i> 1, 2, 3.</i>

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.360
<i> But what if we
 make it harder?</i>

00:01:01.393 --> 00:01:05.098
<i> Get ready to point to where
 each number was in order...</i>

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:06.732
<i> now.</i>

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:08.501
<i> If you feel like you didn't
 have enough time</i>

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:10.436
<i> to memorize the screen,
 that's fine.</i>

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:12.338
<i> It's nothing
 to be ashamed of.</i>

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:14.307
<i> Or is it?</i>

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.510
<i> Here is a chimpanzee
 taking exactly that long</i>

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:20.580
<i> to memorize the same
 arrangement.</i>

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.515
<i> Nailed it.</i>

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:24.851
<i> Each of these puzzles
 is completely new</i>

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:26.452
<i> to the chimpanzee,</i>

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:28.654
<i> but just a glance
 is all it needs</i>

00:01:28.687 --> 00:01:30.557
<i> to completely capture
 all the numbers.</i>

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.293
<i> How can a chimpanzee's memory</i>

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:35.795
<i> be so much better
 than ours?</i>

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:38.331
<i> Well, one theory
 is that we humans</i>

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:42.502
<i> are worse at this task
 because we can talk.</i>

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.420
What makes humans different
from other animals?

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:03.723
Well, one thing is language.

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:06.325
We have the cognitive ability

00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:08.895
to communicate not just about
what's happening now,

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:14.200
but also about what did happen,
and what could happen.

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:16.802
We can tell stories,
and it's awesome.

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:19.872
But if language is so good,

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:23.443
why didn't any other animal
develop it like we did?

00:02:25.444 --> 00:02:27.446
<i> A good approach
 to this question</i>

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:28.915
<i> is one that looks
 at how we are different</i>

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:31.551
<i> from those who were almost us.</i>

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:33.920
<i> Around 7 million years ago,</i>

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:36.923
<i> there were no chimpanzees
 and there were no humans.</i>

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:39.225
<i> But there were CHLCAs,</i>

00:02:39.258 --> 00:02:40.860
<i> an acronym which stands for</i>

00:02:40.893 --> 00:02:43.796
<i> "Chimpanzee-Human
 Last Common Ancestor."</i>

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.531
<i> Like us,
 CHLCAs didn't have</i>

00:02:45.564 --> 00:02:48.201
<i> great natural offenses
 or defenses,</i>

00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:53.606
<i> protective shells or claws,
 fangs or venom.</i>

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.709
<i> So living in the safety
 of the trees was great.</i>

00:02:56.742 --> 00:03:00.413
<i> Those who stayed became
 the chimps we know today.</i>

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:02.915
<i> But for reasons we're still
 not quite sure of,</i>

00:03:02.948 --> 00:03:06.953
<i> some of the CHLCAs decided
to venture down to the savanna.</i>

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:09.755
<i> Without appropriate
 physical abilities,</i>

00:03:09.788 --> 00:03:13.259
<i> things like cooperation,
 imagining new strategies,</i>

00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:17.330
<i> and the assigning of roles
 were necessary for survival,</i>

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:19.265
<i> all of which are easier
 if you have</i>

00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:20.900
<i> a rich collection of symbols</i>

00:03:20.933 --> 00:03:23.703
<i> that can refer to things
 across time:</i>

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:25.471
<i> language.</i>

00:03:25.504 --> 00:03:27.440
<i> Many different types
 of creatures emerged</i>

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:29.342
<i> with varying adaptations.</i>

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:31.611
<i> But today, only one member
 of the family remains.</i>

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:33.679
<i> Us.</i>

00:03:33.712 --> 00:03:36.749
Language as we know it may have
been one of the strategies

00:03:36.782 --> 00:03:39.518
that kept us alive
in the savanna.

00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:42.388
But where did it move in?

00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:44.790
The brains of those
who developed language

00:03:44.823 --> 00:03:46.993
and those who didn't
aren't totally different.

00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:51.330
A brand-new brain structure
didn't just pop into existence.

00:03:51.363 --> 00:03:54.834
Instead, anatomy used
for other tasks

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:57.503
must have been sacrificed.

00:03:57.536 --> 00:04:00.406
And as it turns out,
for beautiful reasons,

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:02.908
detailed short-term memory

00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:05.678
may have been
a fair thing to lose

00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:08.414
in return for language.

00:04:08.447 --> 00:04:11.917
This trade-off
between memory and language

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.622
is the Cognitive Tradeoff
Hypothesis.

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:26.999
<i> The Cognitive Tradeoff
 Hypothesis</i>

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:43.929
[electricity hums]

00:22:45.096 --> 00:22:46.664
Have you ever had a human

00:22:46.697 --> 00:22:48.500
and a chimpanzee compete
like that together?

00:22:48.533 --> 00:22:49.934
You having fun?

00:22:49.967 --> 00:22:51.836
-Whoa!
-No, not really.

00:22:51.869 --> 00:22:53.571
[shrieks]

00:22:53.604 --> 00:22:55.840
I am going to make
my hometown

00:22:55.873 --> 00:22:57.909
function like a brain.

00:22:57.942 --> 00:23:00.612
[cheering]

00:23:00.645 --> 00:23:05.116
Doing a good moral deed can
actually make you more likely

00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:07.085
to do something immoral.

00:23:07.118 --> 00:23:10.054
We're going to see if we
can get people to allow a child

00:23:10.087 --> 00:23:12.157
to take the blame
for a crime they committed.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:14.058
-How old are you, son?
-Twelve.

00:23:14.091 --> 00:23:15.860
[guard] We're going to need
to talk to the police.

00:23:15.893 --> 00:23:18.897
This facility is where you both
cryo-preserve people

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:20.799
and store them.

00:23:20.832 --> 00:23:24.936
We have 159 patients
in these tanks.

00:23:24.969 --> 00:23:28.740
We're offering an unknown
extension of human lifespan.

00:23:28.773 --> 00:23:31.910
-[Michael] You spied
on their dream.
-Yeah.

00:23:31.943 --> 00:23:33.945 line:92%
That's pretty spooky.

00:23:33.978 --> 00:23:36.815
[Michael] We received a message
from outer space.

00:23:36.848 --> 00:23:40.218
Please figure out
what this message is saying.

00:23:40.251 --> 00:23:42.187
-[man] You ready?
-I'm ready.

00:24:10.248 --> 00:24:12.917
Hey, I have to leave
and go over to the next episode,

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:14.151
but you can come with me.
