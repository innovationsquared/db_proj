00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.140
Using GPS, these trails represent pizza delivery
in Manhattan on a typical Friday night.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.520
And is this a frog or a orse?

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.600
It's episode 52 of IMG!

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.800
This lemon looks yellow to me, and it probably
looks yellow to you as well, but not in

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.739
the same way. You see, here in this room,
this lemon is "Subtractively Yellow." It absorbs

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:37.370
all visible wavelengths of light except for
yellow light, which it reflects onto my retina.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.590
But the screen that you are using to watch
this video doesn't produce yellow light at

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.030
all. In fact, it can only produce red, blue,
or green light. The really cool, but kind

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.730
of disturbing thing about this is that here
in the room, I am actually seeing "real" yellow

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.910
light. But you are seeing "fake" yellow. Absolutely
no yellow is coming off your screen and falling

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.670
onto your retina. But it still looks yellow
because it's quite easy to lie to the brain.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.240
Our retinas contain three different types
of cone cells that are receptive to color

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.280
and each one is best suited to detect a certain
color. One is great for blue, the other is

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.560
great for green and the third is great for
red. Notice that there is no individual cell

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.000
looking for yellow. So, the way we actually
see yellow happens like this. The wavelength

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.040
of yellow light falls between the wavelengths
of red and green. And, so, when an object

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:44.109
reflects yellow light onto your retina, both
the green and the red cones are slightly activated,

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:48.109
which your brain notices and says "well, that's
what happens when something's yellow, so it

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:49.609
must be yellow."

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.430
All a computer monitor or a mobile phone screen
has to do to make you think you're seeing

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.939
yellow is send a little bit of red and a little
bit of green light at you. As long as the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.950
pixels and the little subpixels on them are
small enough that you can't distinguish them

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.910
individually, your brain will just say "well,
I'm recieving some red and some green, that's

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.870
what yellow things do...hmm...it must be yellow."
Even though it actually is not...

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.940
Lemons can also produce electricity. A little
bit of zinc, a little bit of copper, and boom,

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.100
you're moving electrons around. But not that
many, I mean, the current voltage are quite

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.840
low.
You could run an LCD, but even a potato could do that...

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.590
If you wanted to run a flashlight bulb, that
would take 3,000 lemons. And if you wanted

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.349
to run a halogen bulb, well, that would take
37,000 lemons. But artist Caleb Charland

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:44.589
doesn't care.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:52.860
He spent 11 hours hammering nails into 300
living apples hanging on trees. By connecting

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.000
them to a household lamp, he was able to make
it glow just dimly enough to capture this

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.960
image with a 4 hour exposure.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.100
Less alive and more frightening are Steve
Shaheen's sculptures: little dudes with bulb

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.739
heads desperately trying to plug themselves in.

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.989
Merve Kahraman's "Revitalizer" never dies.
It's a lightbulb surrounded by wax. Now, the

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.920
wax melts because of the lightbulbs heat,
and drips into a special container into all

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.519
kinds of weird new shapes, but whenever you
want you can just flip it so that the new,

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.579
cooled wax is at the top.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.820
But my favorite is the Fukusada wooden lightbulb.
It looks like a solid block of wood, but it's

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:40.939
actually hollow and chipped to a nearly paper-thin
width. When you turn it on you can see the

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:42.739
light coming from inside.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.320
Combos.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:53.400
Artist Tang Yau Hoong blew my mind this week.
We've got clear days and smoke, boats and

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:04.360
crocs, whales and hearts, Pie-bike, brains
and boxing gloves, day and night, but don't

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.860
be scared, you can always paint yourself some
light. Or just swing on some light.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.620
Ok, let's frame it this way. Climbing Wall.
This fitness club in Japan uses frames and

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.040
other pretty interior elements to create a
decidedly less rugged climbing wall.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.880
But let's get simple. Like, minimal.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:31.530
Thanks to Lego, here are their bricks arranged
to represent famous characters. Enjoy.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.740
Now for some Art Illusions.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.120
Here's a cute couple, but can you see, in
this very same image, the baby they will soon

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:01.260
have? Or how about these zebras? There's
a lion hiding amongst them. Can you find it?

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.450
Billboards can be clever, but here's a great
one that makes it look like someone is pushing

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.030
out a section of the building.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.140
But how many of you will remember seeing it?
If we assume that you don't remember experiencing

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:20.520
major cultural events before you're 5 or 6
years old, that means that every year there

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.820
are fewer and fewer people alive who remember
experiencing recent historical events.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:33.680
xkcd made this amazing chart to show when,
in the future, the majority, more than half

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.650
of living americans, will not remember being
alive when certain things happened. For instance,

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:46.590
he calculated using data from the US Census
Bureau that 2012, this very year, is the

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:53.980
first year in American history since in which
fewer than half of living Americans remember

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.690
being alive in the 1970's.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.860
By 2041, most of us won't remember a time
when Pluto was actually called a planet. By

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:10.020
2043, most of us alive won't remember living
during George W. Bush's presidency. And by

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:16.070
2047, more than half of living Americans
will not have been alive to have remembered

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.880
anything that you did today.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.180
Like when you made that funny face in the
yearbook. No, no, no, THAT funny face.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.730
If you're not following @tweetsauce, you're
missing out on daily Vsaucey content, most

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.250
of which never makes it to a video. So go
follow us on Twitter and I'm gonna leave you

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:40.040
with another combo. A tessellation, while you
listen to Jake Chudnow's "Flan." He made a

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.170
music video for this song over on his channel,
so check that out.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.570
And as always,

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.030
thanks for watching.
