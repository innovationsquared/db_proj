Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And today we're going to talk about

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.649
humor, comedy.
What makes something

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.710
funny and when something's funny, why do we laugh?

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.309
What's the purpose of laughing and why
do we laugh when we're tickled?

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.070
Well, people study this.
They're called gelotologists

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.420
and we don't have all the answers yet,
but what we do know is that you are

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.930
thirty times more likely to laugh

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.650
if there are other people around.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.000
We also know that babies laugh before
they learn a language

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.360
and that babies born blind and deaf will laugh.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.059
There are thousands of languages,
hundreds of thousands of dialects, but yet we

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:41.540
all

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.010
laugh in much the same way.
Our brains are constantly looking for

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.260
patterns - ways of understanding the world and
predicting what's next. It's to our

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.850
evolutionary advantage. And so when
something begins in a way that we expect

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.059
and then all of a sudden changes and
surprises or delights us,

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.489
we often react with laughter,
because we have just

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.500
learned something.
We've learned a new

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.700
logical order.
This theory posits that things are

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.539
funny because there's an incongruity
between what we expected

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:16.750
and what happened.
Whether it's a dog

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.170
dressed like a human or a clever use of word play.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.869
In other words, comedy is about learning.

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.420
But once you've learned the new logical
order of the joke,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.190
well it ceases to be funny,
which is why jokes are funny the first time,

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.000
but not every other time after that.
Take a look at this

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.670
percentage sign.
Alright, so you know what a percent sign is.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.150
But besides the percent, there's also a permil

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.710
and permyriad symbol.
But that's not

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.290
funny, because even though it might be
new information to you, it still falls

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.009
right in line with the logic of the
percent symbol. But what Demetri Martin shows

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:55.290
us

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.720
with just one more line,
you can make it look like a man cheering

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.860
after taking a dump... well, that surprises us.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.540
But we don't only laugh when something's funny.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.670
What about tickling? How does that make any sense? Most of us don't like being

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.200
tickled, but when tickled we can't help but smile

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.670
and laugh.
Well, a possible explanation is that tickling

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.370
helps teach children at a young age
proper defensive

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.380
behaviors. Is it a coincidence that the
most ticklish areas are also

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.510
the most vulnerable
and the ones that we instinctively cover

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.570
when startled. Also, because being tickled
makes the person laugh,

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.129
it may encourage others to tickle them,
teaching them

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.379
these defensive skills.
Tickling may even play a role

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.800
before you are born.
In order to avoid being tickled, a baby

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.129
gets into a better position to be delivered.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.760
Now, physically, laughing involves the

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.310
epiglottis - a little flap thing that
protects the trachea

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.340
whenever we swallow, so that food and water
doesn't go down into our lungs.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.739
I know it doesn't look very funny,

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.080
but this is where the laugh happens.
The epiglottis constricts the larynx

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.739
and we get the LOL.
Interestingly,

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.760
the epiglottis actually has taste buds
on it, which means that,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.860
anatomically speaking, comedy truly is

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.240
a matter of taste.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.200
Get out of my house!

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.420
And as always,

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.120
thanks for watching.
