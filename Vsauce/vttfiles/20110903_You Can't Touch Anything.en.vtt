00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:06.059
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And today
we're going to get close, like really close.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.640
In fact, I want to answer the question
what's the closest we can get to other objects

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:12.729
and other people?

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:15.600
Now, it might sound like kind of a simple easy question,

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:17.849
but when we get down to the atoms of it,

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.859
it's quite complex and might leave
you feeling a little bit alone.

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.859
When I go like this, my fingers, for all
intents and purposes, are touching.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.039
But, at an atomic level, they're not.

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.209
That's right, in fact, if you're sitting in a chair

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:39.299
right now, your body is technically not touching the chair

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:43.339
at all. Instead, you are hovering above the chair

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:46.379
by some tiny, tiny atomically sized gap,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.500
something too small for us to even see, but it's there.

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:54.139
And it's caused by the fact that your butt and the chair are made out of atoms.

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:58.459
Now, as we all know, the matter that we deal with every day is made out of atoms.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.600
And an atom is a nucleus surrounded by an outer shell

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.989
of orbiting electrons.

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.360
Now when two atoms get close to each other
that aren't going to bond or chemically react,

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.069
they have trouble touching each other.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:14.540
Why? Because electrons repel one another,

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.189
because they have the same charge.

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.089
And because of a fancy thing
called the Pauli exclusion principle,

00:01:20.089 --> 00:01:22.729
we also know that all of an atoms electrons

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.180
cannot all be pushed down to the same energy level
all together on the same shell.

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:33.399
So what this means is that if I touch something,
I'm technically not really touching it.

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.439
The atoms are getting quite close together,

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.839
but the electromagnetic repulsion between electrons

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.880
is saying no, no, no, no, closer.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.440
Now, of course, the nerves in my skin can feel that repulsive force and that's what I call

00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:49.149
the texture or the feeling of the object.

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.069
If I push hard enough of course, I can break or poke into

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.029
or cut something, but I'm not touching

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:59.339
any of its matter, I'm just pushing it out of the way

00:01:59.339 --> 00:02:02.379
using the electron-electron repulsion forces.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.799
Even though you can cut things really easily like this,

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.839
the scissors never touched the card.

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:10.679
This is where it gets depressing.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.179
What all of this means is that when you kissed
your girlfriend or pet your dog

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:21.059
or hug your grandmother, you're not actually
making contact with their matter.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.380
You're not technically touching them, you're just feeling

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.100
the repulsive force of their electrons.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.040
But maybe there's hope.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.459
Let's just avoid electrons altogether and ask ourselves

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.759
what can we do to affect the nucleus of
someone else's atoms?

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.780
Maybe we can do that?

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.160
You're going to have to be a little bit
radioactive if you're going to want to do this

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.560
and luckily, people are a little bit radioactive.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.000
In fact, if you sleep in a bed with another person
for an entire year,

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:58.009
your body is actually exposed to one millirem

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:00.549
more radiation than someone who sleeps alone.

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.689
Now, we are talking about tiny, tiny amounts that really don't affect your body at all,

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.239
but still, they are there.
How did they get there?

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.999
Well, carbon 14 is in the air, and potassium 40

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:13.859
is in bananas, that's right.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.320
Bananas have a really high potassium content.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.699
In fact, any food that has a lot of potassium in it, like Brazil nuts, is going to act the same way.

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.669
All of that potassium is fine and dandy,

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:26.559
but about one out of every 8,000 or so potassium atoms

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:30.099
is a radioactive isotope of potassium.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.080
In fact, if you were to eat 600 bananas,

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.299
it would be the equivalent of getting a chest x-ray.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.139
Okay, cool, so I am a little bit radioactive.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.840
Does that mean that if I hug someone really close that some sort of radioactive ray

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.300
might come out of my body and go into someone else's body and get absorbed into

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.980
a nucleus of one of their atoms and then we could really finally say that we touched on a fundamental level?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.159
Maybe.

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:02.399
The radiation that comes out of us is very unlikely to hit someone else's atoms and

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.500
because people don't contain
a lot of radioactive material

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.240
in the bodies, that energy is just going to get absorbed and you're not going to really know that it happens

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:13.059
and the chance, like I said, is super unlikely.

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:19.679
So maybe we should go back
a little bit and talk about chemical reactions.

00:04:19.679 --> 00:04:22.579
Back when I mentioned
that atoms have trouble touching,

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.620
they are a little more friendly if they
get together and, you know, share electrons.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.020
Now, this kind of stuff is happening all the time.

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:34.699
When I eat food, my body is chemically reacting with that food to take out the nutrients,

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.529
get rid of the stuff I don't want, but
short of being a cannibal

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:42.089
and eating someone's arm or being a zombie,

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:46.960
how can I get chemically,
reactionally close to a person?

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:50.789
Well, luckily, there is a thing called birth.

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.139
When you're growing inside your mother,

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.559
your father and mother's DNA
are all working together

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.380
in chemical ways to create you.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.519
Because they're sharing electrons
it seems at least more like a touch.

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:08.659
I guess what I'm trying to say is that, in a way,
your parents and your children

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:13.609
are the only people you can know for
certain you've come the closest

00:05:13.609 --> 00:05:16.409
to actually touching.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.159
And that's touching.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:19.820
And as always,

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.100
thanks for watching.
