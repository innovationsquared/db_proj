00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.800
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.040
This symbol, commonly called a Yin Yang

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.230
symbol, is a taijitu meaning diagram

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.230
of the supreme ultimate. The principal

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.070
of Yin and yang, opposites existing in
harmony,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.310
is associated with ancient Chinese
philosophy.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.310
But the very first use of the iconography,
the classic symbol,

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.570
actually comes from a shield pattern
used by the ancient

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.050
Romans seven hundred years before its first

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.690
known use in China.
A connection between the two

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.870
has yet to be found.
Regardless of who came up with it first,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.790
the symbol was a bright idea.
But what's the brightest object in the entire universe?

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.210
Well, apparent magnitude.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.240
Commonly used when stargazing refers to
how bright an object

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.980
appears to us, say, when looking up from Earth.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.410
It depends on Earth-centric factors,
like how close the object is

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.520
to our planet. Magnitudes are logarithmic

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.010
and arranged like golf, where a smaller number

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.300
means a greater brightness. But today

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.600
I'm looking for absolute magnitude,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.280
a measure of how bright things all over
the universe near

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.400
and far would be if we looked at them
from the same distance.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.200
Absolute magnitude will guide
us to the most blinding

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.330
light in the universe, irrespective of it looking faint

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.550
to us here on Earth, just because it's far away.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.930
The difference is significant. A 100-watt light bulb

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.660
placed closer than 8 centimetres - about
3 inches - from your eye

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.150
will appear brighter than the Sun in the sky.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.610
But that's not fair. If you could see the Sun and the bulb

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.840
from the same distance, the Sun would be
a septillion times brighter.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.520
That's bright. But the Sun

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.750
shines punily compared to the rest of the cosmos.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.100
If you could line the Sun up with
everything else out there,

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.190
giving every star and cosmological
phenomenon

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.450
a fair chance, the Sun's absolute magnitude

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.300
would be 4.8. Not bad. But check out

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.170
R136a1. This nuclear fuelled beast isn't

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.940
the biggest star in terms of volume but it's 256

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.010
times more massive than our Sun.
It's the most massive star

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.410
ever found and it's also the brightest.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.620
Remember that lower absolute
magnitudes are brighter.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.100
R136a1 isn't 4.8,

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.000
like our Sun, it is -12.6,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.819
which means it is 8.7 million times brighter

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.270
than our own Sun. But R136a1

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.180
isn't the brightest thing out there.
When a giant star dies, it explodes violently

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.390
in what is known as a supernova

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.880
or hypernova. As I mentioned in my video

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.010
'How Hot Can It Get?',
supernovas can eject terrifying flashes of

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.520
radiation known as gamma ray bursts.
Arguably,

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.010
the brightest electromagnetic events in
the universe.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.120
A typical gamma-ray burst releases as much

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.450
energy in a few seconds as our Sun

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.600
will release altogether in its entire

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.660
10 billion year lifetime. If WR104,

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.070
a gamma-ray burst future candidate, directly struck

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.440
Earth with such a beam for only 10 seconds

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.910
astronomers predict it could deplete 25% of our

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.050
ozone layer and lead to mass extinction and starvation.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.670
The largest thermonuclear bomb ever detonated

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.080
didn't do anything close to that and it
was exploded right

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.660
here, in our atmosphere. Whereas WR104

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.400
is eight thousand light years away.
You can't even see it with your naked eye

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.720
or a pair of binoculars.
But gamma ray bursts are merely brief

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.210
events lasting only a few minutes at most, sometimes

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.660
just a matter of milliseconds. If you want the brightest

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.769
sustained thing, you'll paradoxically have to look

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.180
at the darkest thing. Black holes.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.830
To be fair, dark matter is ostensibly

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.919
darker. But because dark matter has been hypothesized

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.780
to not even interact with light, with electromagnetism

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.240
at all, calling dark matter "not bright"

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.630
is kind of like calling your peanut butter sandwich

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.590
"a not fast airplane".
It's not really even in the same category.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.110
Black holes, however, do interact with light;

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.600
reflecting so little, well, they don't let any

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.900
escape, at least not in a form resembling the way

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.490
it came in. That's dark.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.400
But the intense energies created by
black holes in the process of eating

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.020
things like stars

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.020
is anything but dark.
Gas and debris from the stars they eat swirl into

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.449
arcipluvian cosmic gallows known as accretion discs

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.139
before making their final death plunge
into the black hole.

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:27.139
In the disc, debris spins at unfathomable
speeds, pulled around by a black hole

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.270
billions of times more massive

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.680
than our Sun.
Friction in the accretion disk generates heat

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.949
on a level difficult to fully appreciate.

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:40.680
Just as hot things glow, the disk does too.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.680
So brightly it has its own name.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.960
A quasar.
Quasars shine thousands of times more brightly

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.400
than even the brightest stars.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.879
I'm kidding, it's scarier

00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:00.629
than that.
Quasars shine thousands of times more brightly

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:05.150
than galaxies containing billions of stars.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.910
The first identified quasar, 3C 273,
has an absolute magnitude

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.430
of -26.7, making it

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.940
four trillion times brighter than our Sun,

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.670
about 100 times more luminous than the
total amount of light produced by the

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.860
entire Milky Way. If you put 3C 273

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.770
33 light years away from us it would
shine as brightly as our Sun - 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.810
a mere 8 light minutes away.
Blocking the brightness of a quasar with the corona

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.700
graph reveals that quasars exist in the
centers of galaxies

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.720
that are larger than them in area, but are, nonetheless,

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.190
drowned out by their light.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.520
Such galactic centres are called active galactic nuclei.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.700
The bulk of their energy spewing forth
in the form of a powerful radiation jet,

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.820
the length of which puts even

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.740
our solar system to shame.
The visible part of the jet

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.400
in this photograph, for instance, is so
long it could stretch from the Sun

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.180
to Pluto and back, one-and-a-half million times.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:16.460
Now, specifically, if a large portion of
this ajected energy heads toward Earth,

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.520
it's responsible for what we call a quasar.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.650
But if Earth is right and the active
galactic nucleus' sights,

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:27.170
it's got a scarier name: a blazar.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:32.240
And it's blazar 3C 454.3 that clocked
in the greatest brightness

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.640
ever observed.
At historically high levels of activity it registered in

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.180
absolute magnitude of -31.4.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.560
To put the brightness of quasars

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.260
in yet another perspective, take a look
at the one hundred thousandth

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.390
picture snapped by the Hubble telescope.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:54.340
This is a star a few hundred light years away.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.400
And this thing looks just about as bright,

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.440
but it is a quasar.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.380
9 billion light years away.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.720
Why are quasars so far away?

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.980
Well, a quasar is not forever.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.620
They are billions of light years away,

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.800
which means the light we receive from
them, the pictures we take of them,

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.210
are pictures of things happening
billions of years ago.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.300
They represent a phenomenon more common

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.400
early in the universe's history, when
monster black holes hadn't eaten

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.920
all the stars around them to fuel their
accretion discs and

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.540
before those holes became too fat to be active.

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.780
Neil deGrasse Tyson points out that in order to remain

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.180
a quasar producer, a black hole must consume

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:47.280
about 10 stars a year. Many

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.970
consume more than a thousand stars a year, 600

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.680
Earths worth of matter every single minute. The more

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:59.650
stars a black hole consumes,
the larger its event horizon becomes

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:03.490
until, eventually, it no longer shreds stars apart

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:07.230
to fuel an accretion disc.
Instead, it just swallows them whole

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:11.930
in one dimmer, but still terrifying, gulp.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.520
Quasars are some of the most
ancient things in our universe.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.150
If you could teleport instantaneously to one right now

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:27.050
faster than light, it would most likely
no longer be burning. What we see

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:30.200
are just their ghosts. Light that left when they were

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.830
active that traveled longer than they could live.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.900
But quasars can still be born. They can even be born

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.950
right here, in fact. In my video

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:44.650
'What Will We Miss?' I pointed out that
the Andromeda Galaxy

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.580
is headed our way.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.740
In 3 to 5 billion years it will collide

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.130
with our own galaxy, the Milky Way. And the collision

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:58.560
could rearrange stars near the
galaxy's central black holes to be consumed,

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.019
reigniting a quasar right here, in our galactic backyard.

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:06.440
Funny enough, right now very few of us even see

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.300
Andromeda, even though all you
need is your unaided eye.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.050
Light from our cities drowns out the night sky like a

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:19.870
quasar drowns out its host galaxy. Artist
Thierry Cohen mocked up what big cities

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.930
would look like if all their lights were

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:25.069
off and the sky above them could be seen

00:10:25.069 --> 00:10:29.060
fully. New York, Hong Kong, Shanghai,

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:33.449
Tokyo, Los Angeles. It's beautiful

00:10:33.449 --> 00:10:36.660
and rare. In the 1990s,

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.769
during a blackout in the city of Los Angeles,
a number of residence

00:10:40.769 --> 00:10:45.980
actually called the police they were
afraid of mysterious glowing clouds

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.769
hovering above the city. They were seeing

00:10:49.769 --> 00:10:53.639
our galaxy for the first time in their lives.

00:10:53.639 --> 00:10:57.130
At night, artificial lights allow us to see

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.220
what's around us but we lose

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.680
what's above us. The brightest places

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.040
have the darkest, emptiest skies.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.740
There's Yin and Yang again. A taijitu
has actually been lurking in this video

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.199
the entire time.

00:11:13.199 --> 00:11:16.220
The brightest things in the universe, quasars,

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.510
are caused by the darkest things in the universe -

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:24.389
black holes. The process that unshackles the most light

00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:28.089
is caused by the thing that best imprisons it.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.040
And as always,

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.610
thanks for watching.
