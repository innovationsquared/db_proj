[Michael]
<i> Before I embarked on
 my journey to Japan,</i>

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.044 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
<i> to learn about the Cognitive
 Tradeoff hypothesis,</i>

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:13.279 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
<i> I first visited
 Dr. Terrence Deacon,</i>

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:16.282 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
<i> professor of neuroanthropology
 at UC Berkeley.</i>

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:21.287 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> to learn about the hardware
 on which language had to be
 installed: the brain.</i>

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.392 align:start size:75% position:25%
[Deacon] So, these
are all preserved brains
in formaldehyde.

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
You know what I love
about this room?

00:00:27.593 --> 00:00:30.063 align:start position:0%
One is that
you've got a cabinet

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:32.665 size:88% position:44%
full of giant buckets that
just have your name on them,

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:35.334 size:75% position:38%
and they don't look like
they contain nice stuff.

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:37.703 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
But also this fridge--
"BIOHAZARD."

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:39.472 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
-That's not where
you keep your lunch.
-That's right.

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:42.509 align:start size:88% position:13%
-This is not a place
where people get to eat.
-Right.

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:46.345 size:84% position:42%
This is just a human brain,

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:48.481 align:start position:0%
preserved and then wrapped up
in Saran Wrap,

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:50.083 align:start position:0%
like a leftover.

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:52.385 align:start position:0%
You clearly didn't just
grab this from someone.

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:56.355
No, that's right. Today human
brains are highly protected,

00:00:56.388 --> 00:00:59.358 align:start size:66% position:34%
and lots of paperwork
is required.

00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:04.497 align:start size:69% position:31%
They're available,
but it takes a lot
of careful tracking...

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.367 align:start position:0%
-Do you have to like report on,
"Yep, I still have it. Hasn't
been stolen..." 
-Yep, exactly.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.136 align:start size:91% position:9%
Who is it?

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:12.238 align:start size:63% position:38%
- I do know that
this is from a male.
-Okay.

00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:14.273 align:start size:66% position:34%
I believe this
is an 80-year-old,

00:01:14.306 --> 00:01:16.843 align:start size:81% position:19%
but roughly in that range.

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:17.977 size:88% position:44%
Let's move on to this brain.

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:21.881 align:start size:94% position:6%
So, this is a bonobo,
close relative to chimpanzees.

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:24.584 align:start position:0%
No kidding.
They look really similar.

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:29.222 align:start size:72% position:28%
In biological terms,
humans are just another
African ape.

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:33.126 align:start size:75% position:25%
In cognitive terms,
we're like a whole
other phylum of animals.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.263 align:start position:0%
So, I mean, where are
these physical differences
that make us--

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:39.866 align:start size:88% position:13%
-Right.
-I mean, maybe we're not
that different, really.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.170 align:start size:63% position:38%
So, in one respect,
none of these brains

00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:47.340 size:88% position:56%
have parts that others lack,
including the human brain.

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:49.342 align:start size:72% position:28%
There's no special part
in the human brain

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.611 align:start size:72% position:28%
to do any of the things
that make us special.

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:55.148 align:start size:78% position:22%
And that's, again,
because of the incredibly
conservative nature

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:56.782 size:84% position:58%
of how brains have evolved.

00:01:56.815 --> 00:01:59.719 align:start size:78% position:22%
Why don't I just pick one
of the primate brains,

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:03.689 align:start size:69% position:31%
and the human brain,
and we'll just compare
different brains.

00:02:03.722 --> 00:02:07.560 size:88% position:44%
There's something that feels
very strange about knowing

00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:10.830 align:start position:0%
that this...belonged
to a person.

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:15.334 align:start position:0%
I mean, the ape, it's very--
It's amazing how different
that feels.

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:19.272 align:start size:75% position:25%
-I tell people
to respect this.
-Yes.

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:20.773 align:start size:56% position:44%
But also this one.

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:24.911 align:start size:91% position:9%
All of these were living,
feeling, experiencing beings.

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:27.246 align:start position:0%
Okay, so let's look at these
and show me,

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:32.318 align:start position:0%
is there a place in the brain
where there's a lot of
language going on?

00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:35.454 align:start position:0%
What we do know about language
is that most of the brain

00:02:35.487 --> 00:02:37.723 align:start position:0%
is actually involved
in some aspect of it.

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:41.594 align:start position:0%
-Yeah.
-You really need the whole
working cerebral cortex

00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:43.529
to do what you and I do now.

00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:46.332 align:start position:0%
Let's take a look at
the non-human primate brain.

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:47.900 align:start size:78% position:22%
It's laid out
pretty much the same way.

00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:50.269 align:start position:0%
Look at that.
But there's still so similar,

00:02:50.302 --> 00:02:53.339
not just in physical shape,
but even the responsibilities

00:02:53.372 --> 00:02:56.209 align:start position:0%
or roles that
the different places play.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:03:01.214 align:start size:94% position:6%
Not only that, some of
my early work was able to show
that the connectivity

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:03.883 align:start size:59% position:41%
of these structures
between each other
is the same.

00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:07.286 align:start size:91% position:9%
-Wow.
-Or very, very similar.
Obviously, this is larger,

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.723 align:start size:84% position:16%
-Yeah.
-but the basic pattern
of connections is the same.

00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:17.496 align:start position:0%
[Michael] What do you think
of the Cognitive Tradeoff
hypothesis?

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:20.967 align:start size:81% position:19%
So, first of all,
the systems that do memory
in our brain

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.238 align:start size:94% position:6%
are not fundamentally
different in their structure
and their circuitry and so on.

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:28.507 align:start size:84% position:16%
-Yeah.
-I think in the absence
of language, we would

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.911 align:start position:0%
-probably be like chimpanzees,
gorillas, orangutans, and so on.
-Right.

00:03:31.944 --> 00:03:36.549 align:start position:0%
But yet, they're able
to perform really well
at tasks

00:03:36.582 --> 00:03:39.919 align:start position:0%
that seem to look like,
"Did they take a picture
or something?"

00:03:39.952 --> 00:03:45.024 align:start size:81% position:19%
Exactly. Chimpanzees
seem to do reasonably well
at some of these tasks.

00:03:45.057 --> 00:03:49.595 align:start position:0%
But we've traded off
that ability in order
to focus on language.

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:52.798 align:start size:81% position:19%
Because the memory systems
we use in language

00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:55.668 align:start size:78% position:22%
interface with each other
in a way that's unusual.

00:03:55.701 --> 00:03:58.638 size:84% position:58%
Let me give you an example.
Every book on my shelves,

00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:01.941 size:88% position:56%
no two sentences, probably,
alike in any of these books.

00:04:01.974 --> 00:04:04.877 size:88% position:56%
An<i> immense</i> amount of detail!

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.515 size:88% position:56%
And, having read a good part
of almost all these books,

00:04:09.548 --> 00:04:11.784 align:start size:72% position:28%
I couldn't tell you
any of these sentences.

00:04:11.817 --> 00:04:14.720 align:start size:81% position:19%
-No.
-But if you ask me
what's in<i> this</i> book,

00:04:14.753 --> 00:04:17.623 align:start size:94% position:6%
what's its main ideas,
I can probably give it to you.

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:19.959 align:start size:97% position:3%
-That's a remarkable capacity.
-Yeah.

00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:25.765 align:start size:94% position:6%
So what I'm suggesting as
the tradeoff is sort of giving
up the specific details--

00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:30.970 align:start size:88% position:13%
to sacrifice it at one level
gives it back to us
at another level.

00:04:31.003 --> 00:04:33.306 align:start size:94% position:6%
That's the power
that we have gained from this.

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:38.844 align:start size:94% position:6%
Because of that power,
we can get at information that
no other species can get at,

00:04:38.877 --> 00:04:43.483 align:start size:84% position:16%
both in our own experience,
and in describing things
in the world.
