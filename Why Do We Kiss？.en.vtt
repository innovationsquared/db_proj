Hey, Vsauce, Michael here.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:12.370
Attachment of two people's lips kissing. 
The average person will spend about 20,160 minutes

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:19.199
of his or her life kissing. And the world
record for the longest, continuous kiss is

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.759
58 hours 35 minutes and 58 seconds.
But why do we kiss?

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.880
I mean, if you think about it, it seems kind
of weird...right? I mean, sure, today kissing

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:39.820
represents peace, respect, passion, love.
But when the first two people in human history

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:48.019
kissed, were they just kind of being gross?
Well, let's begin with what we do know: kissing

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.539
feels good and it's good for you.

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:57.939
A passionate kiss burns about 2-3 calories
per minute, and releases epinephryn and norepinephryn

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.769
into the blood, making your heart pump faster.
Kissing more often is correlated with a

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.920
reduction of bad cholesteral and perceived
stress. But these positive effects didn't

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.920
become widespread by accident. Why did brains
and bodies that love kissing become so common?

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.409
Well, a popular story holds it that Pacman's
shape was inspired by the shape of a pizza

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.270
with a slice missing. But Toru Iwatani, the
creator of Pacman, admitted that this was

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.740
only half-true. Pacman's shape was also inspired
by rounding out the shape of the Japanese

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.079
character for "mouth." And it's mouths and
Pacman's favorite activity, eating, which

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.570
together bring us closer to the heart of the kiss.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.439
Evolutionary psychologists have argued that
what we know today as "kissing" may have come

00:01:53.439 --> 00:02:01.409
from "kiss-feeding," the exchange of pre-chewed
food from one mouth to another. Mother birds

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.570
are famous for doing this, and many primates
are frequently seen doing it as well. Not

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.720
that long ago, it was common between human
mothers and their children. In fact, before

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.600
commercially produced or DIY baby-food instructions
were readily available, it made a lot of sense.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.170
Recently, Alicia Silverstone uploaded a clip
of herself mouth feeding her child. It seemed

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.470
strange to some people, but even though, yeah,
it exchanges saliva, which, like any contact

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.920
with an infant, can transfer pathogens, healthy
mothers and healthy children can benefit from

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.840
the fact that kiss feeding provides nutrients.
Carbohydrates, proteins, iron and zinc, which

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.540
are not always available in breast milk. 
Plus, an adult saliva can help pre-digest the food,

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.580
making vitamins like B-12 easier for the baby to absorb.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:01.580
So, mouth-to-mouth attachment has a history
of intimacy, trust and closeness. Your saliva

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.630
also carries information about who you are,
your level of health, and mucus membranes

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:15.030
in our mouths are permeable to hormones like
testosterone, making a kiss a way to taste-test

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:23.360
a potential mate. A good kiss can be biological
evidence that your kisser might be a good mate.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.870
So, as a strategy for mate selection, pre-historic
people who enjoyed kissing, and did it more

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.750
often, may have made better decisions, picked
better mates, reproduced more successfully,

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:44.070
and, eventually, become the norm. Giving us...us,
people who love kissing.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.940
Any infant could have seen those benefits
coming from a mile away, even though an infant's

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.160
vision isn't that great. From birth to four
months, babies can only focus on things about

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.020
8-10 inches away from their face which, not
surpisingly, is about the distance to their

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.570
mother's face while breast feeding.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:11.330
So, faces, especially those looking right
at us, tend to be the very first things in

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:19.370
our lives we can focus on and see clearly.
This might explain why we are so good at detecting

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.870
faces. Humans are off the charts when it comes
to this, in fact, we tend to see faces even

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.560
when there aren't any.
It's called "pareidolia."

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.600
Because humans are so cooperative, it makes
sense for us to be good at recognizing faces.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:42.740
And, more importantly, detecting when someone
is looking directly at us and clearly expressing

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.360
when we are looking at someone else.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:52.540
A predator who lives by not being seen needs
a gaze that's less obvious. In fact, research

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.770
has shown that our surprisingly white scleras,
the area that borders the iris, isn't just

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.199
an accident, but is a vital piece of human
eye morphology that makes it easier for us

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.960
to ascertain the direction of someone else's
gaze at a glance.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.580
We also have impressive gaze-direction networks
inside our brains, containing individual neurons

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:22.490
that fire when someone is staring directly
at us, but that stop firing if the gaze shifts

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.400
just a degree or two.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:31.500
So, yeah, you can tell when you're being watched.
We humans are quite sensitive to it, even

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:39.949
those of us with "Scopophobia," the fear of
being stared at. But to be sure, in order

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:46.419
for this to work, the other person's gaze
must be within your line of sight, your field

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:53.050
of vision, that is, you can see them. 
Otherwise, if the stare is coming, say, from behind,

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.120
there is no evidence that people can tell
they are being watched.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:04.270
The "Psychic Staring Effect" falls within
the realm of pseudo-science. No widely-accepted

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:10.900
studies have ever found evidence that it exists.
Anecdotally, what's more likely is that the

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:18.680
very act of rubber-necking to see who's watching
causes people to look up, and for your gazes

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:19.949
to attach.

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:26.949
But what about attachment when no one is
watching? One explanation for an infant's

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:34.220
love, attachment to their mother, doesn't
involve vision or staring, but, instead, food.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:40.800
The idea is that we love our mothers because
as soon as we are born, they are a source

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.840
of life-sustaining nourishment. But what
if that nourishment came not from a loving

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.409
mother, but from a scary "Wire Mother"?

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:57.789
In the 1950's, Harry Harlow conducted a series
of famous, but controversial, experiments

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:04.370
on monkeys at the University of Wisconsin,
Madison. Harlow's findings had substantial

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:10.729
implications on our understanding of attachment.
But by today's standards, his work would

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:17.469
largely be considered unethical. In one of
his most famous experiments, Harlow separated

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:22.479
young monkeys from their mothers as soon as
they were born and stuck them in cages with

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:29.479
two fake mothers: a soft one wrapped in cloth
that did nothing, and a cold, mechanical mother

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:36.900
made of wire that, nonetheless, did provide
food. But despite being a cupboard mother,

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:43.580
the young baby monkey's didn't bond with her.
When Harlow and his team scared the baby monkeys

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:50.580
with a strange contraption, the monkeys ran
and clinged not to their wire source of life-sustaining

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:58.300
nourishment, but to the soft, cuddly and
otherwise useless cloth-mother.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:04.099
This suggested that warmth and comfort was
more important than food when it came to nurturing

00:08:04.099 --> 00:08:11.099
attachment. Harlow also built a rejecting
mother, which used a blast of pressurized air

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:19.529
to push baby monkeys away. But instead of
finding another source of comfort, these monkeys

00:08:19.529 --> 00:08:25.610
clung even tighter at all times than monkeys
raised without rejecting mothers. And this

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:32.229
is what blows my mind. The instinct for warmth
and comfort in newborn creatures is so strong

00:08:32.229 --> 00:08:40.780
it not only resists attempts to frustrate
it, but is paradoxically strengthened by it.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:46.540
Eckhard Hess tested this by using electric
shocks to discourage ducklings from following

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:52.470
the object they were imprinted on. But it
only strengthened the behavior and made them

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:59.130
follow more closely than ever before. The
fact that a "wire mother," or a rejecting

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:06.690
mother, or receiving electric shocks for attaching
to your mother, would cause more attachment,

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:14.240
more love, more dependence, seems like a paradox.
But paradoxes can teach us. As Oscar Wilde

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:20.060
put it, "a paradox is the truth standing on
its head to attract attention."

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:25.250
And what gets our attention here is the effect
uncertainty can have.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:32.250
In 1955 A.E. Fisher conducted an experiment
on puppies. His team separated puppies into

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:37.600
three groups. Members of the first group were
treated kindly every time they approached

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:43.620
a researcher. Members of the second group
were punished for approaching the researchers.

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:50.030
And puppies in the third group were randomly
treated kindly or punished. They grew up

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:56.140
never knowing what to expect. Their world
was not a world of kindness or punishment,

00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:00.290
but rather one of uncertainty.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:06.020
What's really chilling is that the study found
that that group, the third group of puppies,

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:13.530
wound up being the most attached to the researchers.
The third group loved the researchers the

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:20.510
strongest and was the most dependent upon
them. Guy Murchie called this the "Polarity

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:26.450
Principle": "stress, including the mental
stress of uncertainty, is an ingredient in

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:34.550
attachment or love and perhaps even manifestations
of hatred (its polar opposite) somehow enhance

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:35.740
love."

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:41.830
Uncertainty, psychologically, can lead to
some of the greatest feelings of attachment

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:49.910
and dependence. Good things, and bad things,
in our lives often seem random and out of

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:56.000
our control. So, it's no surprise that we
often react with blind love and acceptance

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.990
in the face of an unfair existence because,
what else are we supposed to do? We are that

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.530
third group of puppies.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:11.530
But investigating uncertainty, conquering
it, so as to make the best decisions possible

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:20.530
is advantageous. So, over time, life has favored
activities that turn uncertainty into knowledge.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:25.990
Not every person out there is the best mate
for you, but if it didn't matter which one

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:32.530
you picked, a kiss, a taste-test, wouldn't
be necessary, and it wouldn't need to feel

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:36.190
so good or bring us so much pleasure.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:39.050
So, go out there and kiss someone today.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.150
And as always, thanks for watching.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:57.320
By the way, tomorrow I am headed to the European
Space Agency's Space Port in South America

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:03.730
with Euronews to watch a rocket launch in
real life. Do you have any questions about

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:10.640
space or space travel today? Let me know in
the comments below and I will ask the experts

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.320
your questions.
