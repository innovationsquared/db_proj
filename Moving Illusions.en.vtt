00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.980
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. This is a completely still

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.990
image but as your eye reads well I'm
saying and jumps from word to word,

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.150
the paragraph will appear to slightly, just

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.340
subtly, wave and boil. The allusion is called anomalous

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.820
motion. It's neat. But to say it's fun

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.090
is tautology because the word

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.410
illusion literally means to have fun,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.050
to mock, to play with. But illusions aren't

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.239
just fun and games. They also teach us

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.820
about our brains. Anomalous motion,

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.860
for instance, demonstrates that our brains process

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.309
things at different rates and piece by piece.

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.700
After a saccade, a quick eye movement, higher contrast

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.000
elements are perceived sooner than lower contrast

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.120
ones. When arranged in just the right way,
this delay is exploited

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.120
and your visual system only has one explanation.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.609
Low contrast parts of the image
didn't get processed later

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.780
because this myelinated machine is
wrong but rather because the image

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.420
itself

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.790
must be moving. Akiyoshi Kitaoka's brilliant

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.770
"Out of focus" causes nearby neurones to
disagree about the little slices they

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.409
each detect. Some see big changes

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.070
after a saccade and some see hardly any.
This makes it difficult for our brains

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.220
to calculate and factor in the effect

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.350
of our own eye movements, so the image itself

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.460
appears to be moving. But illusions aren't just about

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.630
moving. They can also be

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.689
moving, poignant, significant,

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.369
practical. They can mean the difference
between life and death,

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.549
like in nature or during World War I

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.890
as dazzle paint on ships.
This form of camouflage doesn't conceal the object

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.659
but rather

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.600
makes it difficult for an enemy to ascertain its prey's

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.729
true shape and thus where it's heading

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.009
or how fast it's going. In 1955

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.509
the Soviet Union displayed their new
Bison and Bear long-range bombers

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.040
at an air show. It looked like they had

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.480
a lot. Afraid of falling behind, the US
ramped up production on their own

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.930
B-52 bomber. But the whole thing

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.440
was an illusion. In the Soviet's film of the air show

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.860
the same few planes had been flown
past the camera multiple times

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.050
in formations that gave the illusion of
them having more bombers

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.080
than they really did. By the end of the
1950s the Soviet Union

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.730
only had about 150 long-range bombers,

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.160
whereas the Americans, fooled

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.090
by the illusion, had built nearly 2,000

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.790
at a cost of 900 million dollars.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.400
Architecture is full of examples of real-world practical

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.060
optical illusions. My favorite are Disney castles.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.370
They appear huge but it's

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.379
forced perspective - a lie. The tops

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.959
appear further away from us because they are actually

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.419
quite tiny.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.660
Illusions also tell us about ourselves culturally.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.100
The MÃ¼ller-Lyer illusion is classic.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.150
The horizontal lines are all the same
length but the bottom ones

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.489
appear longer to people from Western cultures,

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.379
familiar with our rules of perspective
and man-made straight lines.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.629
However, bushmen from
Southern Africa and tribespeople

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.260
from northern Angola or the Ivory Coast aren't

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.000
fooled at all. Akiyoshi Kitaoka

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.159
is using optical illusions to discover glaucoma

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.379
earlier than current techniques can. And

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.319
anamorphic illusions are used to save lives.

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.159
They look weird from any perspective but one,
from which they seem to pop out

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.159
defying the environment's actual shape.

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.439
Hoping to remind drivers to always pay attention

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:10.120
traffic safety organizations in
West Vancouver, Canada placed a skewed

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.670
decal on the road. From the right perspective,

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.979
the perspective of the driver in this case,
it becomes a 3D illusion of a child

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.910
you are about to hit.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.100
Slow down. Brusspub has made some
incredible examples of the 3D effect

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.810
such illusions can happen.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.280
This object? Just an anamorphic projection.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.740
Anamorphic illusions have also
been used to safely practice

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.240
political dissent.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.199
In 1746

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.699
supporters of the Stuart claim to the British throne

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.580
had to be quiet about it. It was treasonous.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.120
So, sympathizers served things on

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.570
trays that looked like this.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.340
Innocuous enough until only supporters

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.990
were around.
And it was safe for someone to place a reflective

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.979
goblet or cylinder on the tray,
revealing the tray's anamorphic secret a

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.470
hidden portrait

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.930
of their elicit love, Charles Edward Stuart himself.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.410
The Encyclopedia Titanica lists descriptions

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.530
of everybody recovered from the Titanic.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.410
It's quite macabre. Why was the iceberg

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.600
not seen until it was too late?

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.930
And why did the nearest ship - the Californian -

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.509
not come to the Titanic's rescue sooner?

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:37.840
Tragic questions whose answers might be

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.979
optical

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.699
illusions. The Titanic was sailing through conditions

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.059
perfect for mirages.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.080
This theory points out that the Titanic sank

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.630
at the border of the warmer Gulf Stream
and the frigid Labrador Current,

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.320
where the normal case of cooler air at higher altitudes

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.340
was inverted - a thermal inversion.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.580
Now, because the temperature of air
effects its index of refraction,

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.250
a thermal inversion means light bending

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.460
in a typical ways. If light reaches the eye

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.919
from higher up than usual, objects can appear to float.

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:18.760
Seriously. Like this ship off the coast of Australia.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.440
A thermal inversion can also render
objects completely unrecognizable,

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.000
hidden within a haze, like this ship(?)

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.419
Or like an iceberg.

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.789
Or a sinking ship in need of help.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.880
The Delboeuf illusion may be causing

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:40.820
teeth to split and crack more often than they should

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.480
when dentists drill holes in them.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.380
Doctor Robert O'Shea observed

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.199
8 practicing dentists and found that
they were all drilling holes

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:53.870
that were too big, 
even though they knew the correct size

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.270
to be drilling.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.480
Why? Well, it may be the same reason people

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.530
eat more food when they're given a bigger plate.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.070
Objects appear smaller when enclosed by larger areas.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.400
Holes of the same size may appear
different sizes on bigger

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.090
teeth. Dentists may be deciding that correctly sized

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.760
holes drilled in the teeth need to be made larger,

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.440
not because they do, but because perception

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.140
is a tricky thing.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.220
Illusions affect not only big ships and

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.740
teeth but also your future.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:35.539
The End of History Illusion is our
tendency to think of ourselves today

00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:38.079
as somehow done.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.140
Sure.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.979
I went through a lot of personal growth
and changes in taste

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:46.590
in the past, but today, who I am now,

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.790
this is pretty much the final me.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.740
But that's not true.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.990
Studies have consistently shown that
people underestimate just how

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.560
different they will be, say, 10 years in the future,

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.639
even though they can easily point out
how much they've changed

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:06.849
since 10 years ago.
I like how Daniel Tomasulo puts it:

00:08:06.849 --> 00:08:10.110
"We believe we are going to live, love,

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.729
and long for where, who,
and what we are thinking about

00:08:13.729 --> 00:08:18.029
right now.
But the research says it just ain't so.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.300
This too is a transient state."

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.539
Yogi Berra put it even more succinctly: "The future

00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:27.619
ain't what it used to be."

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.979
Their advice

00:08:28.979 --> 00:08:32.440
is don't imagine your future.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.740
Look at other people and their
experiences instead, take their advice.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:41.450
Your imagination is just that, their experiences

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.730
are actual data. Well, of course,

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.700
it's not that simple. Which brings us to our final

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.070
illusion: The illusion of control.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:57.740
Named by psychologist Ellen Langer,
it's our tendency to believe we control the

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.140
outcomes of things.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.220
We demonstrably don't.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.620
It can help motivate us to not give up

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.839
and, in healthy people at a healthy level, it is

00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:11.039
optimistic self-appraisal.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.640
But it's a lie.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.199
In one study, traders in the City of
London's investment banks were shown a

00:09:17.199 --> 00:09:17.790
graph

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.930
of a real time stock price and given three

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.279
buttons that secretly didn't do anything

00:09:24.279 --> 00:09:28.459
to affect the price.
But they were told the buttons might have an effect -

00:09:28.459 --> 00:09:31.740
try them out, see what you can do.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.290
Afterwards, the traders were asked to
rate how much they felt they had been

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.260
able to control the stock price

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.570
with the useless buttons. And it turns out

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:47.110
the traders who reported the greatest
sense of control over the stock price

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:50.750
were the ones who scored lowest
on risk management tests

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.209
and, in the real world, contributed the least

00:09:54.209 --> 00:09:57.829
to their company's profits and in terms of salary

00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:59.529
made the least money.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:05.240
It's kind of a bummer.
The illusion of control is a nice feeling

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:10.610
but sometimes it's fine,
sometimes it even pays handsomely to admit

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.860
you don't have control.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:13.740
And as always,

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.140
thanks for watching.
