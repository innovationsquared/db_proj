00:00:01.050,00:00:03.310,"The Future of Reasoning"
00:00:03.310,00:00:04.440,"Hey Vsauce!"
00:00:04.440,00:00:05.840,"Michael here."
00:00:05.840,00:00:07.889,"Where is your mind?"
00:00:07.889,00:00:10.200,"Is it in your head?"
00:00:10.200,00:00:17.420,"I mean, that’s where your brain is — and your brain remembers, plans, makes judgements,"
00:00:17.420,00:00:25.029,"solves problems … but you also remember and plan with things like these and this."
00:00:25.029,00:00:33.320,"And you solve problems and make judgements with all sorts of other stuff, too."
00:00:33.320,00:00:40.989,"The more you think about it, the more you realize that while the brain is a wet lump"
00:00:40.989,00:00:48.260,"of fat and protein, no firmer than a glob of tofu, the MIND is something much larger:"
00:00:48.260,00:00:53.840,"it’s an ever-expanding organ of tissue AND wood and stone and steel."
00:00:53.840,00:00:55.399,"And people."
00:00:55.399,00:01:02.769,"Because of communication we can even make OTHER PEOPLE extensions of our minds."
00:01:02.769,00:01:07.620,"We can access their memories and perceptions and knowledge by simply asking."
00:01:07.620,00:01:09.200,"Or not."
00:01:09.200,00:01:14.680,"I don’t need to learn how to fix a car AND practice medicine AND vulcanize rubber OR"
00:01:14.680,00:01:20.750,"remember everything … other people are doing that for me just as I do things for them."
00:01:20.750,00:01:27.400,"We are a species of individuals that is also one big interdependent lumbering growth."
00:01:27.400,00:01:31.090,"A frantic blur of flesh and concrete."
00:01:31.090,00:01:38.020,"A ‘techno sapien’ powered by imaginations and passions made real by a hallowed faculty"
00:01:38.020,00:01:39.300,"we call REASON."
00:01:39.300,00:01:45.000,"Reason, it is said, guides us to truer knowledge and better decisions."
00:01:45.000,00:01:51.120,"It’s allowed us to increase life-expectancy, suffer less, work together better, and it’s"
00:01:51.120,00:01:56.100,"bound to take us further and higher until the end of time."
00:01:56.100,00:01:58.850,"Or is it?"
00:01:58.850,00:02:05.360,"The organ we USE to reason takes millions of years to evolve, but the fruits of reason"
00:02:05.360,00:02:08.180,"grow rapidly and are ever accelerating."
00:02:08.180,00:02:13.560,"In the next four decades, we’re expected to build the equivalent of another new york"
00:02:13.560,00:02:15.980,"city every month"
00:02:15.980,00:02:22.200,"More concrete was installed in the last two decades outside the US than the US installed"
00:02:22.200,00:02:25.110,"during the entire 20th century."
00:02:25.110,00:02:29.500,"This growth means that quality of life around the world is rising."
00:02:29.500,00:02:35.500,"It means that electricity, manufactured goods, food, comfort and transportation are all becoming"
00:02:35.500,00:02:38.110,"more common and accessible."
00:02:38.110,00:02:44.460,"But there are hints that reason and logic are struggling aginst the complexity of it"
00:02:44.460,00:02:50.180,"all; against our growing dependence on the things we’ve built and their unintended"
00:02:50.180,00:02:52.750,"consequences."
00:02:52.750,00:02:59.220,"Nearly every part of life as we know it today involves or relies on a process that releases"
00:02:59.220,00:03:02.640,"molecules with lopsided electrical charges."
00:03:02.640,00:03:08.380,"This property causes them to absorb and re-emit thermal radiation, pinging it around so that"
00:03:08.380,00:03:11.540,"it escapes into space more slowly."
00:03:11.540,00:03:15.900,"Having more warmer parcels of air means stronger weather events."
00:03:15.900,00:03:21.730,"They can’t be pinned on any particular extreme storm, but they make extreme storms in general"
00:03:21.730,00:03:23.910,"more extreme and frequent."
00:03:23.910,00:03:29.550,"What’s a stake isn’t just ‘bad weather’ it’s disaster: it’s more lives lost, more"
00:03:29.550,00:03:34.410,"property lost, it’s more droughts, more hunger, more famine, more people needing refuge,"
00:03:34.410,00:03:40.670,"and a even greater reliance on the very things that caused the problems in the first place."
00:03:40.670,00:03:48.390,"In total, we release about 51 billion tons of such gases every year and we need to release"
00:03:48.390,00:03:50.810,"zero."
00:03:50.810,00:03:56.040,"But how do you re-think … everything?"
00:03:56.040,00:04:00.020,"Who gets to direct the costs and tradeoffs?"
00:04:00.020,00:04:05.980,"How do you achieve collaboration between nearly every local and national government when what"
00:04:05.980,00:04:11.260,"works in one place won’t work everywhere, when decisions effect jobs in one place and"
00:04:11.260,00:04:12.739,"food in another."
00:04:12.739,00:04:19.509,"When not just things need to be re-thought, but also habits and traditions and values."
00:04:19.509,00:04:25.380,"How do you achieve consensus when a problem isn’t obvious to the senses, is far away"
00:04:25.380,00:04:30.930,"in space and time, requires solutions that affect people in different ways, and as a"
00:04:30.930,00:04:36.400,"product of science, always carries some uncertainty?"
00:04:36.400,00:04:42.969,"The philosopher Timothy Morton calls something so massively distributed in time and space"
00:04:42.969,00:04:50.279,"and so viscous — so STICKY that it adheres to all that touch it, a HYPEROBJECT."
00:04:50.279,00:04:56.229,"Every civilizations that grows at the speed of reason must at some point face hyperobjects."
00:04:56.229,00:05:02.289,"In fact, the fact that we still haven’t found evidence of intelligent life beyond"
00:05:02.289,00:05:07.999,"Earth has been brought up as evidence that some sort of GREAT FILTER, might exist that"
00:05:07.999,00:05:12.860,"few civilizations manage to get past."
00:05:12.860,00:05:19.330,"That a hyperobject like our impact on the planet might be such a great filter is not"
00:05:19.330,00:05:20.330,"a new idea."
00:05:20.330,00:05:26.569,"What it’ll take to solve it is the topic of Bill Gate’s HOW TO AVOID A CLIMATE DISASTER."
00:05:26.569,00:05:31.620,"And I decided to do this video in partnership with him and his team because the way we deal"
00:05:31.620,00:05:35.860,"with hyperobjects reveals a lot about the mind."
00:05:35.860,00:05:40.319,"It’s easy — and common! — to think that we would all be better off if everyone was"
00:05:40.319,00:05:43.710,"just more rational."
00:05:43.710,00:05:48.909,"But what if reasoning wasn’t built for what we’ve become?"
00:05:48.909,00:05:53.460,"Let’s begin by looking at behavioral inertia."
00:05:53.460,00:05:57.740,"Behavioral inertia is the tendency to keep doing what you’re already doing."
00:05:57.740,00:05:59.160,"Status quo bias."
00:05:59.160,00:06:04.930,"It can be a frustrating bias if you desire change, but its origin isn’t a flaw."
00:06:04.930,00:06:10.410,"If an organism has managed to survive long enough to reproduce and provide and care for"
00:06:10.410,00:06:16.270,"its offspring, then the state of its world, was sufficient for its genes to spread."
00:06:16.270,00:06:18.289,"That’s all it takes to persist."
00:06:18.289,00:06:24.159,"The types of organisms we see around us will naturally be those that managed to persist"
00:06:24.159,00:06:27.719,"and didn’t, after reaching the point at which they could persist, rock the boat too"
00:06:27.719,00:06:29.759,"much."
00:06:29.759,00:06:35.159,"Behavioral inertia can help slow down the accumulation of unintended consequences and"
00:06:35.159,00:06:42.569,"the loss of ideas that work, but it can also slow down innovation and adaptation."
00:06:42.569,00:06:49.539,"If the environmental impacts of our society were more immediate and un-ignorable, it wouldn’t"
00:06:49.539,00:06:52.789,"be so tempting to apply this inertial brake."
00:06:52.789,00:06:59.220,"But emissions are invisible and their consequences aren’t immediate or local."
00:06:59.220,00:07:02.990,"They impact future people and people far away."
00:07:02.990,00:07:07.990,"Those who are different from us, poorer than us, people we will never meet."
00:07:07.990,00:07:13.610,"This may be one of the first challenges advancing civilizations face: weilding not just the"
00:07:13.610,00:07:19.990,"power of technology and distributed cognition, but also the responsibilities."
00:07:19.990,00:07:28.719,"Extending not just the mind but also EMPATHY could certainly be a great filter."
00:07:28.719,00:07:34.919,"Our lower instincts may bias us, but surely, REASON can help us navigate towards the future"
00:07:34.919,00:07:36.639,"we want, right?"
00:07:36.639,00:07:38.680,"Well, what IS reason?"
00:07:38.680,00:07:41.189,"It’s a way of making inferences."
00:07:41.189,00:07:48.190,"An inference is any new information extracted from the information you already have."
00:07:48.190,00:07:54.099,"We make inferences all the time — every living thing does."
00:07:54.099,00:07:59.689,"We don’t have measuring-tape tentacles that shoot from our eyes, and what actually enters"
00:07:59.689,00:08:06.189,"our brain is just a 2D image, but our brains nonetheless INFER depth by attending to cues"
00:08:06.189,00:08:10.839,"like stereopsis, occultation, perspective, parallax, size…"
00:08:10.839,00:08:15.259,"When this happens, we accept it as reality."
00:08:15.259,00:08:20.240,"We aren’t aware of the visual processing that made it possible and don’t have to"
00:08:20.240,00:08:21.240,"be."
00:08:21.240,00:08:27.410,"If, however, we do consciously consider WHY a certain conclusion was reached, then BOOM"
00:08:27.410,00:08:28.770,"that’s REASONING."
00:08:28.770,00:08:34.220,"Reasoning is the process of making inferences not automatically and instrinctively, but"
00:08:34.220,00:08:39.060,"by looking at facts and seeing what conclusion they support."
00:08:39.060,00:08:43.599,"When Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of the Earth to within a percentage or two"
00:08:43.599,00:08:48.990,"of the value accepted today, he didn’t do it by MEASURING the Earth and he didn’t"
00:08:48.990,00:08:55.329,"just percieve it as self-evident, he INFERRED it from what he knew about shadows and how"
00:08:55.329,00:08:57.620,"long it took camels to move."
00:08:57.620,00:09:02.870,"Stories like that make it easy to believe that reasoning evolved because it supercharged"
00:09:02.870,00:09:09.920,"our abilities; it clearly moves us towards truer conclusions, better decisions, and knowledge"
00:09:09.920,00:09:12.490,"no other species could infer."
00:09:12.490,00:09:19.540,"Attempts to describe the rules of good, orderly reason, became logic and mathematics, concepts"
00:09:19.540,00:09:26.430,"so general and abstract that while we were still animals, armed with them, we were no"
00:09:26.430,00:09:27.660,"longer beasts."
00:09:27.660,00:09:31.550,"But that’s the rub, isn’t it?"
00:09:31.550,00:09:37.680,"If reasoning is so great, why are we the only species with such a sophisticated grasp of"
00:09:37.680,00:09:38.680,"it?"
00:09:38.680,00:09:44.711,"And if its purpose is truth and good judgement, why don’t we all agree on everything?"
00:09:44.711,00:09:46.699,"These questions make up what Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber call the Enigma of Reason."
00:09:46.699,00:09:52.579,"It’s tempting to think that disagreements happen because while I’M being rational,"
00:09:52.579,00:09:54.930,"those who disagree with me are being irrational."
00:09:54.930,00:09:55.930,"Urgh!"
00:09:55.930,00:09:58.790,"If only people would use reason and logic."
00:09:58.790,00:10:00.300,"What’s happened to the world!"
00:10:00.300,00:10:07.560,"That’s a fair complaint if you’re arguing over logic puzzles, but the world is not a"
00:10:07.560,00:10:09.180,"logic puzzle."
00:10:09.180,00:10:11.649,"this, however, is:"
00:10:11.649,00:10:14.019,"Paul is looking at Mary."
00:10:14.019,00:10:16.260,"Mary is looking at Peter."
00:10:16.260,00:10:18.110,"Paul is married."
00:10:18.110,00:10:19.600,"Peter is unmarried."
00:10:19.600,00:10:24.560,"Is a married person looking at an unmarried person?"
00:10:24.560,00:10:25.560,"Yes."
00:10:25.560,00:10:26.560,"No."
00:10:26.560,00:10:29.889,"Or not enough information to decide?"
00:10:29.889,00:10:32.240,"think about it."
00:10:32.240,00:10:35.120,"The answer is YES."
00:10:35.120,00:10:40.660,"You may have thought there’s no way to know, because we don’t know if Mary is married."
00:10:40.660,00:10:43.810,"But she either is or she isn’t."
00:10:43.810,00:10:49.490,"And if she IS, then she, a married person, is looking at Peter, an unmarried person."
00:10:49.490,00:10:56.770,"If she ISN’T then Paul, a married person, is looking at her, an unmarried person."
00:10:56.770,00:11:01.199,"No matter what Mary’s deal is, the answer will be YES."
00:11:01.199,00:11:05.529,"When people get this puzzle wrong and the correct answer is explained to them, they"
00:11:05.529,00:11:11.350,"almost always immedaitely see why it’s right and change their mind."
00:11:11.350,00:11:13.960,"Life is not usually like that."
00:11:13.960,00:11:17.660,"Now, take a look at this logical syllogism:"
00:11:17.660,00:11:20.420,"All elephants are awesome."
00:11:20.420,00:11:23.120,"Michael is an elephant."
00:11:23.120,00:11:25.769,"Therefore, Michael is awesome."
00:11:25.769,00:11:27.629,"This conclusion is logically valid."
00:11:27.629,00:11:28.629,"But it’s not SOUND."
00:11:28.629,00:11:32.399,"The conclusion follows from these assumptions, but are these assumptions true?"
00:11:32.399,00:11:33.410,"No."
00:11:33.410,00:11:37.490,"I am NOT an elephant."
00:11:37.490,00:11:40.710,"Also, this premise … is subjective."
00:11:40.710,00:11:42.589,"What does it MEAN to be awesome?"
00:11:42.589,00:11:45.269,"Can you measure it with an awesome-ometer?"
00:11:45.269,00:11:50.990,"So you can see why, when analyzing something like our impact on the planet, logic can only"
00:11:50.990,00:11:53.560,"be a partial tool."
00:11:53.560,00:11:59.319,"If some people have more to lose than others, who gets to decide which are fair?"
00:11:59.319,00:12:04.399,"Still, though, it would seem that reasoning should be able help out here."
00:12:04.399,00:12:12.439,"If each of us would just attend to ONLY the facts, surely we’d all recognize the same,"
00:12:12.439,00:12:13.439,"reasonable approach."
00:12:13.439,00:12:18.240,"Problem is, that’s not how reasoning works."
00:12:18.240,00:12:23.180,"Since the scientific study of human reasoning began about a hundred years ago, it’s been"
00:12:23.180,00:12:31.040,"found again and again that we’re not only BAD at reasoning, lazy and biased, but almost"
00:12:31.040,00:12:34.149,"seem PROGRAMMED to be bad."
00:12:34.149,00:12:36.830,"Like the flaws are intentional…"
00:12:36.830,00:12:42.910,"In an episode of Mind Field I once used a magician to pull off a little experiment."
00:12:42.910,00:12:48.120,"He asked people to look at two faces and choose which of the two they would prefer to work"
00:12:48.120,00:12:53.649,"with, placing their preferences in one pile, and those they rejected into another."
00:12:53.649,00:12:59.370,"Then, the pile of people they picked were shown again and each person was asked to provide"
00:12:59.370,00:13:02.830,"a REASON for why they chose that person."
00:13:02.830,00:13:07.110,"But with a little slight of hand, the magician managed to sneak in some of the faces they"
00:13:07.110,00:13:08.670,"had just rejected."
00:13:08.670,00:13:13.139,"Amazingly, the majority of people didn’t even notice the trick."
00:13:13.139,00:13:19.420,"Not only that, they were able to effortlessly explain the reasons behind their choice — a"
00:13:19.420,00:13:23.810,"choice they never actually made."
00:13:23.810,00:13:27.680,"Remembering faces you’ve only seen briefly isn’t the easiest thing to do, but other"
00:13:27.680,00:13:32.889,"studies have shown that even if the task involves answering questions about one’s political"
00:13:32.889,00:13:37.899,"beliefs — things we would seemingly have a firmer grasp on — still nearly half of"
00:13:37.899,00:13:43.079,"participants will fail to notice that answers they gave have been reversed when they’re"
00:13:43.079,00:13:46.189,"later asked to explain them."
00:13:46.189,00:13:52.639,"Point is, we seem practically BUILT to give reasons for whatever we think we must, and"
00:13:52.639,00:13:56.279,"NOT the reasons we actually used to reach a conclusion."
00:13:56.279,00:14:02.000,"What if we don’t even USE reasons to form our beliefs?"
00:14:02.000,00:14:05.110,"Let’s talk about INTUITIONS."
00:14:05.110,00:14:10.100,"Our brains have evolved over millions of years to react to the world around us in brilliant"
00:14:10.100,00:14:12.830,"ways with little to no input from us."
00:14:12.830,00:14:18.110,"For example, when you notice that someone is upset, you’ve don’t consciously think,"
00:14:18.110,00:14:24.829,"“ok, so their eyebrows and oriented like that, their speaking is curt, their posture"
00:14:24.829,00:14:29.589,"… hmmmm … ah ha! those are reasons to conclude that they are upset!”"
00:14:29.589,00:14:34.680,"Instead, the belief that they may be upset was just apparent."
00:14:34.680,00:14:36.399,"You intuited it."
00:14:36.399,00:14:41.310,"You ‘know’ it without exactly know HOW you exactly you came to know it."
00:14:41.310,00:14:47.949,"The mood recognizing parts of your brain operate in a way that is opaque to your awareness."
00:14:47.949,00:14:54.019,"BUT if someone asks you, why you think they’re upset, you can nonetheless produce all sorts"
00:14:54.019,00:14:58.509,"of reasons — some may have been the ones your brain actually attended to."
00:14:58.509,00:15:01.449,"But they’re all just guesses."
00:15:01.449,00:15:09.439,"Instead of using reasoning to COME to conclusions, we use conclusions to come to reasons."
00:15:09.439,00:15:11.610,"To be fair, we CAN go the other way."
00:15:11.610,00:15:15.850,"We love puzzles and when we don’t have a strong intuition either way, we can sit down"
00:15:15.850,00:15:19.670,"and mull over various reason to think one thing or another."
00:15:19.670,00:15:24.430,"Our love of puzzles suggests that reasoning has a survival value."
00:15:24.430,00:15:27.930,"Organisms that found it pleasurable would be more likely to use it."
00:15:27.930,00:15:33.680,"But when we reason alone, even when we have no motivation to reach any particular conclusion,"
00:15:33.680,00:15:40.120,"we STILL exhibit deep biases that seem less like mistakes and more like features."
00:15:40.120,00:15:45.370,"For example, it’s been shown that between two otherwise similar products, people will"
00:15:45.370,00:15:50.759,"prefer to buy the one with more features — even if they don’t want those features, never"
00:15:50.759,00:15:54.249,"plan to use them, and think they’re all pointless and over complicated."
00:15:54.249,00:15:55.559,"Why?"
00:15:55.559,00:16:02.879,"Well it might be that we find such decisions easier to justify … to OTHERS."
00:16:02.879,00:16:08.649,"We won’t feel embarrassed if someone criticizes us for getting fewer features."
00:16:08.649,00:16:14.189,"After decades of findings like this, Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber began to hypothesize"
00:16:14.189,00:16:22.629,"that reasoning to help us make better decisions, but instead, to help us make social decisions."
00:16:22.629,00:16:25.410,"Humans inhabit a cognitive niche on this planet."
00:16:25.410,00:16:32.210,"We aren’t strong or sharp or hidden or venomous, instead, our advantage comes from cognition:"
00:16:32.210,00:16:34.160,"reasoning and cooperation."
00:16:34.160,00:16:39.819,"We can plan hunt, build traps, and engage in coordinated strategies that can be tested"
00:16:39.819,00:16:44.199,"and modified on the fly, not by millennia of evolution."
00:16:44.199,00:16:47.339,"Reasons allow us to so those things."
00:16:47.339,00:16:50.320,"It’s hard to convince people that your intuitions are true."
00:16:50.320,00:16:54.589,"But if you can give REASONS for them, its a whole heck of a lot easier to convince other"
00:16:54.589,00:16:59.910,"people that you’re right."
00:16:59.910,00:17:06.030,"Reason also allows us to justify ourselves in the eyes of others."
00:17:06.030,00:17:11.161,"To explain who we are and express the kinds of reasons we like, what other people can"
00:17:11.161,00:17:15.880,"expect from us, and what we will likely expect from them."
00:17:15.880,00:17:22.150,"This social theory of reasoning helps explain why two people can earnestly and rationally"
00:17:22.150,00:17:23.900,"arrive at different views."
00:17:23.900,00:17:29.150,"They each have their own unique brain and values and dispositions and experiences and"
00:17:29.150,00:17:31.580,"THAT’S what drove their thinking."
00:17:31.580,00:17:36.650,"The reasons they give may or may not be the REAL reasons they came to their conclusions,"
00:17:36.650,00:17:39.730,"but it’s the best anyone can do."
00:17:39.730,00:17:45.270,"The social theory also explains why people tend to give such weak reasons for their beliefs"
00:17:45.270,00:17:49.950,"at first or when their intended audience doesn’t need much convincing."
00:17:49.950,00:17:55.150,"It would be a waste of time and cognitive reasources to construct grand slam reasons"
00:17:55.150,00:18:00.280,"for everything I said and did and thought when it wasn’t necessary."
00:18:00.280,00:18:04.540,"Instead, I can off-load some of the work to other people."
00:18:04.540,00:18:12.700,"If I say, “I want to have lunch at ABC Burgers” my friend might say, “ah, no thanks, I had"
00:18:12.700,00:18:17.780,"burgers yesterday” and I might reply back, “oh well that’s no problem, they also"
00:18:17.780,00:18:20.650,"have hot dogs and great salads”"
00:18:20.650,00:18:25.910,"But if my friend said “ah, no thanks, I’m trying to spend less money eating out this"
00:18:25.910,00:18:32.590,"month” I might reply, “oh well ABC Burgers is really cheap and I;ve got a coupon!”"
00:18:32.590,00:18:37.780,"What’s going on there is that I’m providing reasons only as my interlocutor presses for"
00:18:37.780,00:18:38.780,"them."
00:18:38.780,00:18:42.130,"If they press harder and harder, my reasons will become better and better until either"
00:18:42.130,00:18:47.560,"I win them over, or we come to some different, more harmonious decision."
00:18:47.560,00:18:54.270,"So when people appear to be lazy reasoners or to have bad reasons or none at all, it’s"
00:18:54.270,00:19:00.400,"usually just the case that they’re using reason as it evolved to function; socially."
00:19:00.400,00:19:06.450,"It starts off weak, improving if others push it and always tailoring its work to an intended"
00:19:06.450,00:19:08.230,"audience."
00:19:08.230,00:19:14.110,"the social theory of reasons can even explain the existence of biases that otherwise make"
00:19:14.110,00:19:15.110,"little sense."
00:19:15.110,00:19:20.160,"For example, it would seem that in coming to conclusions about the world, it would behoove"
00:19:20.160,00:19:25.640,"an organism to pay particular attention to information that went against what it believed."
00:19:25.640,00:19:30.980,"That way, they would be able to adjust their beliefs making them truer, more general, and"
00:19:30.980,00:19:32.340,"more complete."
00:19:32.340,00:19:35.910,"To a certain extent, that IS what happens … but not always."
00:19:35.910,00:19:41.450,"When someone “does their own research” they often come to the very conclusion they"
00:19:41.450,00:19:42.450,"wanted after all."
00:19:42.450,00:19:43.450,"When a person strongly believes that our impact on the planet isn’t a problem, they tend"
00:19:43.450,00:19:44.450,"to gravitate towards reasons it might not be and see such reasons in all kinds of data."
00:19:44.450,00:19:50.310,"This is called the CONFIRMATION BIAS: our tendency to look for, prefer, and interpret"
00:19:50.310,00:19:54.370,"information so that it confirms what we already think."
00:19:54.370,00:20:01.120,"It frustrates our ability to accept new, inconvienent data and is a problem for the intellectualist"
00:20:01.120,00:20:03.030,"view of reason."
00:20:03.030,00:20:08.930,"If reason is for finding truth and making better decisions, why would it have this major"
00:20:08.930,00:20:10.060,"weakness?"
00:20:10.060,00:20:16.070,"Because, the social theory says, reasoning is a GROUP ACTIVITY."
00:20:16.070,00:20:24.260,"If I think that option A is true and the best, and you think option B is true and the best,"
00:20:24.260,00:20:30.310,"if we both researched BOTH options and sifted through reasons in support of BOTH options,"
00:20:30.310,00:20:36.000,"we would both have twice the work to do than we would if, instead, I simply came up with"
00:20:36.000,00:20:41.170,"reason for why I was right, and you attended to reasons for why YOU were right."
00:20:41.170,00:20:46.920,"The confirmation bias at least HALVES the cognitive work that must be done."
00:20:46.920,00:20:52.550,"Now sometimes a lone reasoner will have a bad idea."
00:20:52.550,00:20:55.260,"Or a decent idea with some bad parts."
00:20:55.260,00:21:01.250,"The reasons they have to justify and argue for it will be suffiencent for them and those"
00:21:01.250,00:21:04.030,"who intuitively agree but may be weak."
00:21:04.030,00:21:09.570,"But subjected to deliberation, put forth into the machine of collective thought, it can"
00:21:09.570,00:21:16.090,"be evaulated and judged not by one mind or a group of minds thinking alike, but by something"
00:21:16.090,00:21:20.280,"special … the crowd."
00:21:20.280,00:21:25.330,"Humans have long known of the WISDOM OF THE CROWDS: the phenomenon by which a collection"
00:21:25.330,00:21:30.890,"of many people can process information into a conclusion better than any one person could"
00:21:30.890,00:21:31.890,"do alone."
00:21:31.890,00:21:36.800,"It’s why we don’t trust big decisions to a single person, no matter how educated"
00:21:36.800,00:21:38.430,"or powerful they are."
00:21:38.430,00:21:42.880,"Instead, we ask a group of to deliberate."
00:21:42.880,00:21:44.970,"To reason together."
00:21:44.970,00:21:49.610,"In this way, the biases and errors of each is smoothed out and the decision wiser."
00:21:49.610,00:21:54.520,"In a famous example, it’s been repeatedly shown that if you ask a bunch of people to"
00:21:54.520,00:22:00.100,"guess how many jelly beans are in a jar, you’ll find that the average of all of their answers"
00:22:00.100,00:22:04.290,"is CLOSER TO THE REAL NUMBER than any one individual was alone."
00:22:04.290,00:22:05.640,"Even the smartest individual."
00:22:05.640,00:22:11.380,"What happens is that although some people may guess a number way too big, that mistake"
00:22:11.380,00:22:17.940,"is balanced out by the fact that others will inevitably guess a number way too small."
00:22:17.940,00:22:24.480,"All together, their disagreement evens out into spectacular accuracy."
00:22:24.480,00:22:28.710,"We have now arrived at the problem."
00:22:28.710,00:22:34.900,"Reasoning evolved to be used socially where many different perspectives had to all deliberate"
00:22:34.900,00:22:37.300,"towards a common conclusion."
00:22:37.300,00:22:40.770,"Such contexts are becoming less and less common."
00:22:40.770,00:22:46.960,"And it is becoming easier and easier to simply be a lone reasoner, justifying only a particular"
00:22:46.960,00:22:52.230,"viewpoint without doing the harder work of deliberating and acting."
00:22:52.230,00:22:57.570,"The internet gives voices to more perspectives than ever before in our history, but it also"
00:22:57.570,00:23:03.040,"makes it easy to disengage from accountability and find places where everyone believes what"
00:23:03.040,00:23:04.410,"you do."
00:23:04.410,00:23:10.660,"Furthermore, because of technology, we confront more issues more rapidly than ever before"
00:23:10.660,00:23:13.240,"that we’re expected to have opinions about."
00:23:13.240,00:23:18.170,"And the growing complexity and specialization of the modern world makes it difficult for"
00:23:18.170,00:23:23.350,"each of us to have well-informed prepared reasons for the acceleraeting accretion of"
00:23:23.350,00:23:24.770,"intutions we must form."
00:23:24.770,00:23:29.370,"in response, we look for lone reasoners who can defend our intuitions for us."
00:23:29.370,00:23:34.520,"They reasons they give don’t need to be good, just good ENOUGH that we can feel like"
00:23:34.520,00:23:36.970,"justification exists."
00:23:36.970,00:23:42.300,"In the past, unconvincing reasons had to be painted on sandwich boards."
00:23:42.300,00:23:48.600,"But now, the democritization of communication means that even unpopular, unconvincing, nonsensical"
00:23:48.600,00:23:55.670,"ideas can be presented with the same trust-inducing typefaces and professional look as common"
00:23:55.670,00:23:56.670,"ones."
00:23:56.670,00:24:00.380,"Those who disagree may challenge the reasons you’ve been given, show them to be contradictory,"
00:24:00.380,00:24:04.490,"and produce betters ones for THEIR side, but to what end?"
00:24:04.490,00:24:08.800,"It’s all preparation for a debate that never comes."
00:24:08.800,00:24:13.680,"You play a very small role in deciding how society is run."
00:24:13.680,00:24:18.650,"Even if a good faith discussion between a representative slice of America came to a"
00:24:18.650,00:24:24.970,"resolution, if nothing can come of it, why not just throw shade and sick burns or revel"
00:24:24.970,00:24:29.420,"in the pleasure of reasoning by treating everything like a big giant puzzle?"
00:24:29.420,00:24:35.570,"It's easy to think that it doesn’t matter, because after all, those in charge, the brilliant"
00:24:35.570,00:24:40.970,"scientists and powerful billionaires, will surely come to our rescue."
00:24:40.970,00:24:46.740,"Some giant TECHNOSALVATION is surely on the horizon."
00:24:46.740,00:24:48.170,"Perhaps it is."
00:24:48.170,00:24:53.410,"But everything we know about reason suggets that those implementing it should be held"
00:24:53.410,00:24:58.390,"accountable by as many different perspectives as possible."
00:24:58.390,00:25:04.360,"Leaders could lead deliberations and be elected for their ability to moderate social reasoning,"
00:25:04.360,00:25:05.420,"but that’s boring!"
00:25:05.420,00:25:10.590,"Why lead when you could follow: look at what some people believe and generate reasons for"
00:25:10.590,00:25:13.460,"why they’re right, and they’ll love it!"
00:25:13.460,00:25:18.890,"Of course, the hard work — the REAL work — the work that truly elevates us on this"
00:25:18.890,00:25:24.280,"planet, is not in telling poeple that they’re right, but in trying to convince others and"
00:25:24.280,00:25:29.030,"in so doing, use reason as it evolved to be used."
00:25:29.030,00:25:35.460,"The future of reason may in fact be the past of reason."
00:25:35.460,00:25:38.940,"In practice, what does all this look like?"
00:25:38.940,00:25:44.200,"Some researchers have gone so far as to recommend national deliberation days where citizens"
00:25:44.200,00:25:49.470,"celebrate by literally joining small groups and talking through their opinions and comparing"
00:25:49.470,00:25:51.420,"reasons."
00:25:51.420,00:25:56.720,"Tests of such strategies have shown that a return to the small, targeted discussions"
00:25:56.720,00:26:02.530,"our reasoning abilities evolved to excel in leaves all participants with a greater understanding"
00:26:02.530,00:26:07.440,"of not just what they believe and why, but about decisions that could actually be made"
00:26:07.440,00:26:10.570,"and actions that could be taken."
00:26:10.570,00:26:16.210,"Others have gone even further, recommending that the true future of reason at its best"
00:26:16.210,00:26:19.270,"is the construction of a lottocracy."
00:26:19.270,00:26:26.270,"A form of government where decisions are made not by elected leaders, but by people literally"
00:26:26.270,00:26:28.630,"chosen at random."
00:26:28.630,00:26:34.460,"We decide the fate of a person this way, why not the fate of the people?"
00:26:34.460,00:26:40.010,"What IF decisions were made not by politicians alone, but at least occasionally by groups"
00:26:40.010,00:26:45.610,"of actual citizens representing differences in thought, not just geography, who were brought"
00:26:45.610,00:26:51.110,"together and paid for their time to learn from experts and then deliberate on an assigned"
00:26:51.110,00:26:56.320,"issue until a conclusion was reached or, at the least, a recommendation?"
00:26:56.320,00:27:02.030,"Instead of being motivated by re-election, money, attention, and power, individuals chosen"
00:27:02.030,00:27:06.820,"at random would have only their conscious to guide them."
00:27:06.820,00:27:11.060,"Special interests and corporations wouldn’t be able to cozy up to those likely to be elected"
00:27:11.060,00:27:19.230,"— if any one of us could some day serve, they’d have cozy up to and protect … all"
00:27:19.230,00:27:20.290,"of us."
00:27:20.290,00:27:25.520,"Instead of the learning and deliberation being done by people you never meet with offices"
00:27:25.520,00:27:30.510,"in buildings you can’t access, gradually, over time, more and more of your very own"
00:27:30.510,00:27:33.200,"neighbors would have had the honor."
00:27:33.200,00:27:39.090,"People chosen at random would obviously lack the same celebrity status and mandate that"
00:27:39.090,00:27:46.080,"elected leaders cultivate and achieve — and iconic figures we relate to aren’t bad — but"
00:27:46.080,00:27:50.890,"our understanding of reasoning is making it more and more clear that we evolved not to"
00:27:50.890,00:27:57.280,"be leave thinking up to a few great minds, but to the authorty of THE great mind."
00:27:57.280,00:28:03.830,"The lumbering organ of thought that is everyone and everything."
00:28:03.830,00:28:08.700,"This is, in fact, how democracy first worked: lotteries were used to fill many political"
00:28:08.700,00:28:10.730,"positions in Anceint Athens."
00:28:10.730,00:28:12.230,"Aristotle explained that"
00:28:12.230,00:28:17.690,"“the appointment of magistrates by lot is thought to be democratic, and the election"
00:28:17.690,00:28:19.320,"of them is oligrchic”"
00:28:19.320,00:28:25.020,"where an oligrachy is government by only a small number of people."
00:28:25.020,00:28:30.690,"Regardless of HOW reason is brought back to its social roots, if we can build more and"
