00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:03.360
Hey, Vsauce. My name

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.340
is Michael.
And my name is Kevin.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.029
Names.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.210
Humans give each other names

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.559
but so do dolphins. They use

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.980
whistle sounds and will respond to their whistle name

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.279
even when produced by a dolphin they don't know.

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.619
Personal names, personalized

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.949
things, signifying that the named thing is capable of

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.590
feeling. That it's worthy of empathy.
The United Nations

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.040
Convention on the Rights of the Child
has declared that every

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.450
human child born on earth has the right

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.430
to a name.
Every country on earth has ratified the treaty,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.750
except for three: South Sudan,
the newest country on earth,

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.649
Somalia, which has no central government, and

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.219
the United States. Why?

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.829
Well, some organizations

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.829
inside the United States believe that the US

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.650
shouldn't have to listen to another
authority and the treaty prohibits

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.630
the death penalty for children.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.450
It's a moot point now but up until 2005 twenty-two states

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.909
allowed children to be executed

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.380
for crimes. The United States follows the
treaty now but won't promise to

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.790
always do so. Dunce is

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.549
a bad name to be called
but an even worse name

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.009
to be the origin of. Meet Duns

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.060
Scotus, born in 1266.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.409
Popular in his time, later scholars looked
down on his teachings as

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.369
clever but wrong.
They were so critical, in fact, they took

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.979
Duns and turned his name into a noun meaning

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.310
a stupid person - a dunce.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.439
Perhaps you'd rather have had the longest name

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:06.880
ever. A record held by a man born in 1904
whose name was 746 letters

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.830
long.
You can listen to someone pronounce the entire name

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.950
on Wikipedia. What can't

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.069
a name be? Mononymous people only use

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.700
one name. You can name your kid Apple or

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.520
North or Moon Unit. You can name your kid

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.090
Football. But not everywhere.
Some countries require parents to submit

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.340
their children's names to the government

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.590
for approval.
New Zealand enforces a policy in which names

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.629
must not cause offence to a reasonable person,

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.849
not be unreasonably long and should not
resemble an official title

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.459
or rank.
For example, their courts recently forbid a mother

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.690
from naming her child "Sex Fruit."

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.239
But New Zealand has allowed some unusual names.

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.920
Right now, in New Zealand, there are children living

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.870
whose names are officially "Violence,"
"Midnight Chardonnay"

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.540
and "Number 16 Bus Shelter."

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.030
In 1996 a Swedish couple submitted their child's name

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.470
for official approval, "Albin."
But in protest of the naming laws in place at

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.250
the time,

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.470
they spelled Albin like this

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.310
It wasn't accepted.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.880
In the United States you can name your
kid pretty much anything that doesn't

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.170
include obscenity,

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.190
numerals or symbols, which means,
as Carlton Larson points out,

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.590
you can't name your kid R2-D2.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.780
But you could, say, name your child

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.350
Adolf Hitler, which Heath and Deborah Campbell

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.970
did in 2006. Adolf Hitler Campbell

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.250
made headlines in 2009 after a bakery
refused to put his name

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.370
on a cake for his third birthday. Shortly afterwards

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.959
child welfare officials took him and his
other controversially named siblings away

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.700
from their parents and place them in foster care,

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.090
where they remain to this day.
His parents are self-identified

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.120
Nazis and they live in

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.380
New Jersey, the latter of which
makes them New Jerseyans.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.669
If they lived in Kansas they'd be Kansan,
if they lived in New York they'd

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.160
be New Yorkers,
if they lived in Utah they'd be

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.000
Utahns. A name based on where something is from

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.590
is called a demonym, which means that even names

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.800
have names.
An endonym is a name given to a place

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.419
by those who live there.
An exonym is the name given to a place by those

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.479
who live elsewhere.
But my favorite name for a name

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.229
is an autoantonym.
A word that can mean the

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.300
opposite of its other meaning.
For example,

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.450
the word "off," which can mean both

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.530
activated and de-activated.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.530
For instance, the alarm went off,

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.860
so we had to turn it off.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.660
You can track the distribution of your
last name across the entire

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.640
earth using the public profiler.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.419
Or visualize the popularity of the US' top

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:23.090
1000 names over time.
Studies have shown that your name

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.090
may influence your behavior.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.990
The nameâ€“letter effect is a phenomenon
in which people prefer

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.390
words, events, other people and places,

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.360
which contain letters similar to the
letters inside their own

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.210
name.
Measuring a person's preference for such letters

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.010
has been shown to be a good gauge of self-esteem.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.010
Richard Wiseman's Quirkology is a great
read on this topic. He mentions

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.740
"alphabetical discrimination."
People with last names that begin with the letter

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.370
near the end of the alphabet tend to rate themselves

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.950
significantly less successful than
people with names that begin with the

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:04.930
letter near the

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.310
beginning of the alphabet. Perhaps because

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.590
all their lives they've been put on the bottom

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.930
of lists.
Also fascinating is the fact that men and women with

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.330
positive initials, like "A.C.E.,"

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.539
"H.U.G." or "J.O.Y."

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:26.820
live 3 to 4.5 years longer

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.680
than average.
But men with negative initials, like

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.580
"P.I.G.," "B.U.M." or "D.I.E."

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.380
die about three years

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:41.789
earlier than average.
But interestingly, women with negative initials

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:45.169
don't show much difference.
Half of all

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:49.330
Americans share the same 1,712

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.150
last names.
1 percent of Americans have the last name

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.960
Smith.
In China, 85%

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:04.960
share the same 100 last names.
Two-hundred last names cover 96% of the population

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.020
in Vietnam, 40% of which have the same

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.300
last name.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.340
This one.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.260
Name Colleen can hurt people's feelings.
It's at the very bottom

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.840
of Graham's hierarchy of disagreement.
And, at the end of the day,

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.159
names are just words. As the saying goes,

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:30.120
sticks and stones may break my bones but
words are merely the smallest element of

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.120
language capable of

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.110
containing meaning and isolation and, 
as such, could never directly produce the 4,000

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.729
newtons

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:41.430
of force per square centimetre required to break bones.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.570
And as always,

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.500
thanks for watching.
