00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.380
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And I'm sure that
we all love to have fun with hand shadows,

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.900
but how much does a shadow weigh?

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.679
It might sound like a silly question, because
it is. I mean, a shadow cannot be put on a

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:21.919
scale and weighed. But the material that
it falls on top of can be weighed. And

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.180
we know that light has energy. In fact, when
light encounters an object, it pushes that

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.010
object just a little bit. On the surface of
Earth, when sunlight is hitting it, every

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:42.379
square inch is being pushed with a force of
about one-billionth of a pound, which is basically

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.539
nothing. But, over a large enough surface
area, the results can be pretty fun.

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:54.539
On a sunny day, the city of Chicago weighs
300 pounds more, simply because sunlight is

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.490
falling on it, pushing it.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.940
In outer space, where solar wind isn't filtered
by Earth's atmosphere or magnetic field, the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.550
results are even bigger. A space craft, traveling
from Earth to Mars, would be pushed by light

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:16.470
1,000 km off course. So these things have
to be factored into journeys to Mars. We've

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.410
actually already created things that can sail
with light: giant reflective solar sails that

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.050
are pushed by the Sun's light.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.040
So, in a way that is calculable, though difficult
to measure, an area covered in shadow technicaly

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.830
weighs less than surrounding areas being pushed
by light.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.420
But enough about the Sun. There are 3 astronomical
bodies that can cast shadows on the surface

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.540
of Earth bright enough for us humans to see.
One is obviously the Sun, and the other is

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.480
the Moon.
But what's the third?

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.800
Venus.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.080
Pete Lawrence investigated this over a digital
sky. Now, to make sure that the shadow he

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.940
saw was caused by Venus, he used a tube that
could be pointed at specific regions in the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.349
sky. Inside the tube, he put a cutout shaped
like the astronomical symbol for Venus.

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:18.010
Now, here is light coming through the tube
when pointed just adjacent to Venus at a point

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.840
in the sky relatively dark and empty to
the human eye. But here is what came out of

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.640
the tube when pointed at Venus - a  Venusian shadow.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:38.960
We all know that light travels quickly - 
299,792,458 metres per seconds = c.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.439
But this light right here, in fact, the light
coming off your screen into your eyeballs

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:52.879
right now, is moving slightly slower than
"c" because "c" is the speed of light in a vacuum,

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.819
but all of this light if having to travel
through a medium, in this case air.

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:11.059
The speed of light in air is ever-so slightly
slower than "c"- 298,925,574 m/s. This is

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:18.069
interesting because light travels more slowly
through different materials, but "c" remains

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:23.079
the universal speed limit, and as long as
an object doesn't go that fast, it can still

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.499
outpace light in a material.

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:32.899
A charged particle, for instance an electron,
can travel through water faster than light

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:40.180
does, but never faster than "c". When this
happens, we get something analogous to a sonic

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.000
boom. We get a "Photonic Boom."

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.700
In a sonic boom, the sound information propagating
off of the object is in the form of compression

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.320
waves, and as the object gets closer and closer
to the speed of sound, the speed that those

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.559
waves are moving away from it at, each new
wave has less time to get out of the way of

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:08.079
the next, until eventually the waves collapse
all into each other and the denisty and pressure

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.579
is enormous, causing a sonic boom.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.400
Normally, when a charged particle moves through
a material whose molecules can be polarized,

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:26.419
the molecules give off photons. But each photon
has room to fly away, and the waves all destructively

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.050
interfere with each other,
so no radiation is given off.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:36.430
But the faster the particle goes, the less
room the photons have away from each other

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:44.790
and their waves begin to constructively interfere,
giving off a photonic boom - "Cherenkov Radiation."

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:50.099
Astronauts, especially those who have gone
all-the-way to the Moon, have reported seeing

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.680
flashes of light. Many people attribute this
to high-speed particles moving through the

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.680
liquid inside their eye faster than light
normally would, causing photonic boom's right

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.220
inside their body.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.380
Speaking of the speed of light, here's a great
question a few of you have sent me. It involves

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:15.869
a possible way of going faster than "c".
Here's how it goes.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Let's say I want to push a button that is
a lightyear away from me, which means that

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.550
it would take light, the fastest possible
thing in the universe, a year just to get

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.960
from me to the button.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:35.960
Ok, well what if I built a board, one lightyear
long, all-the-way from me to the button and

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.319
then I pushed one end of the board.
Would the other end immediately push the button?

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:46.710
And if so, did I just break the speed of
light? Did I just send information faster

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:53.479
than light? Well, we're not talking about
the speed of light anymore, are we? We are

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.119
talking about the speed of push.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:03.780
When you push a rigid object, what you are
really doing is putting a series of compression

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:10.700
waves through the object, which move at the
speed of sound in the object's material.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.500
The information about "whoa, we've been pushed,
you should move," is sent via that compression

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.860
wave and it only travels at the speed of sound.
So, when pushing a normal day-to-day size

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:28.250
type object, it feels almost instantaneous.
But when pushing a lightyear-long board, it would

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.599
take a lot longer.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.180
A cool way to see this in action is to look
at an object in which compression waves travel

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:41.819
more slowly. For instance, what Veritasium
has done: blowing minds by showing Slinky's

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:48.800
being dropped. The information telling the
Slinky that "hey, uh, we're moving," travels

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.639
through the Slinky slow enough that a slow-mo
camera can see it happen.

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:58.050
If you haven't watched all of Veritasium's
Slinky videos, you've missed out. In fact,

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:03.730
you should watch all of their stuff, it is superb.
But to wrap things up, here's the

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:11.200
point. The speed of push is not instant and
it's certainly not the speed of light. But

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:19.780
light can push you. In fact, technically,
you weigh more when the lights are on than

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.900
you do when the lights are off.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.560
I've put links in the description to all kinds
of cool things you should definitely check

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.980
out for fun and for science.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:30.920
And as always,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.140
thanks for watching.
